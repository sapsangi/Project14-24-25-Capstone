1 Results in Brief
1.1 Executive Summary
The group was challenged by the prospect of enhancing Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA)
without harming commercial wireless networks, which voluntarily elected to transmit WEA
Alert Messages to their subscribers. Members of the alert origination community desire
improvements which would personalize the threat and improve public response to WEA
Alert Messages based on outcomes from social science studies and long known tenets of
public alerting. The most desired improvements include increased message length,
supplementing the WEA with graphical information (e.g., display of the recipient’s locations
along with a map of the threat area, photo of a suspect, missing child, etc.), and improving
the geographical targeting granularity.
Wireless industry members recommend that the FCC focus on enhancements to the existing
WEA rules which are technology neutral. The wireless industry also recommends that
enhancements be consistent with 4G LTE technology which is the predominant cellular
technology. Wireless industry members were most concerned about feasibility and impacts to
cellular networks and improvements which would be consistent with their voluntary election
to participate in WEA and do not violate their obligations to the WARN Act, especially in
the area of liability protection.
There was consensus among the group to recommend the FCC modify their rules to increase
the maximum WEA Alert Message length consistent with capabilities of 4G LTE
(approximately 280 displayable characters subject to technology confirmation by ATIS/TIA
standards).
Obtaining consensus on supplementing the WEA with graphical information and
enhancements to geographical targeting is more challenging. Members of the alert
origination community suggest that the built-in capabilities of mobile devices (e.g., location
finding, maps, Internet connectivity, etc.) be leveraged in order to achieve the desired
improvements. The wireless industry expresses great concern about the feasibility of
providing graphical information since standards-based WEA uses cell broadcast which only
supports text messages, and other solutions may have potential negative impacts to CMSP
infrastructure. Ultimately, an ATIS/TIA feasibility study is recommended to consider several
alternatives as well as potential impacts to CMSP networks. Concerns are also raised about
Intellectual Property Rights issues which may preclude advancements to WEA, most notably
with regard to geographical filtering of alerts at the device level. CSRIC WG2 recommends
that the FCC should work to address these issues.
Recommendations are also made which focus on the use of best practices by CMSPs for cell
broadcast geographical targeting and by Alert Originators for alert message content.

1On February 25, 2013, the FCC issued an order revising Part 10 of its rules by changing the name
“Commercial Mobile Alert System” (CMAS) to “Wireless Emergency Alerts” (WEA) in order to more
accurately reflect common parlance and thus reduce confusion. (See The Commercial Mobile Alert System, PS
Docket No. 07-287, Order, 28 FCC Rcd 1460 (rel. Feb. 25, 2013). Both “CMAS” and “WEA” are used
throughout this document and refer to wireless emergency alerts.

2.2 Objective of CSRIC IV Working Group 2 Subgroup
The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) Working
Group 2 (WG-2) Geographic Targeting, Message Content and Character Limitation
Subgroup is tasked with making recommendations on geographic targeting, message content
and message length of WEA Alert Messages. This subgroup is part of the larger WG-2 which
has also been tasked to make recommendations on WEA testing, other potential types of
WEA alerts (e.g., audio streaming, video streaming and multimedia), and alerting to people
with disabilities. These tasks are identified in the “CSRIC IV Descriptions and Leadership”
document of August 27, 2013. The document also elaborates on the required considerations,
stating that WG-2
“will review the Commission’s current Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) rules, taking into account:
(1) experiences with WEA since its deployment on April 7, 2012 (including those of WEA
industry participants, the Federal Gateway and Alert Originators),
(2) technological advances since the original WEA technical recommendations were
submitted by the Commercial Mobile Service Alert Advisory Committee in 2007, and
(3) other factors, as appropriate, and develop recommendations for CSRIC’s consideration
for any necessary changes to ensure that WEA continues to serve as a valuable method to
alert the public during an emergency.”
While the paging community was a member of the FCC CMSAAC for the development of
the initial alerting recommendations and paging carriers fall under the definition of
Commercial Mobile Service Provider, no paging industry representatives are members of the
FCC CSRIC IV committee. Consequently, the needs and positions of the paging community
are not reflected in this subgroup report.

3.2 Currently Deployed WEA
This section describes the currently deployed WEA. The descriptions below are for
standards based deployed WEA. There have been reports of systems and “apps” that emulate
Page 6The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
WEA but do not comply with the standards, perhaps used by small CMSPs that find it cost
prohibitive to deploy cell broadcast. Such non-standardized systems are outside the control of
CMSPs and are not covered in this document.
The WEA currently deployed by FEMA and most Commercial Mobile Services Providers
(CMSPs) in the United States is based on standards created in ATIS, TIA, and 3GPP
(including joint ATIS/TIA standards). These standards build upon existing standards-defined
infrastructure capabilities (e.g., cell broadcast) and were designed to allow Participating
CMSPs to comply with the FCC regulations for WEA (see FCC Report and Order references
in Section 3.1). New standards were developed to support the interface from FEMA to the
CMSPs (the “C” interface in Figure 1 below). Appendix A contains a listing of the major
CMAS-related standards (as well as some related FCC documents and the WARN Act) used
to support implementation of Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) in the United States.
The current Cell Broadcast based WEA solution only broadcasts text messages and is not
capable of broadcasting multimedia content.
A functional reference model for WEA is shown in the following figure:

Figure 1: WEA Functional Reference Model
With regard to geo-targeting, while the FCC rules specify county-level targeting, the current
standards go well beyond this and allow for a geocode (e.g., a unique identifier for a region),
circle or polygon representing the intended target broadcast alert area from the Alert
Originator through the FEMA alert aggregator and Federal Alert Gateway to the CMSP
gateway. The CMSPs map the intended alert area to the appropriate cell sites and sectors in
their network for broadcast transmission of the WEA Alert Message using the standardized
cell broadcast capability.
The FCC regulations for WEA require geo-targeting to be performed by the CMSPs on a
Page 7The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
county basis, but those regulations also allow CMSPs to geo-target to an area smaller than a
county if the CMSP has the capability to geo-target to a sub-county basis. Many CMSPs
provided comments to the FCC stating that they would voluntarily geo-target WEA Alert
Messages to a sub-county basis, best approximating the alert area polygon given cell
broadcast constraints, even with their initial deployments of WEA. Whether a CMSP geo-
targets on a county or sub-county basis, the algorithms for mapping the intended alert area to
the relevant cell sites/sectors in the CMSP network are considered proprietary and there is no
standard method to perform this mapping. Each CMSP handles the mapping in their own
proprietary manner, since the geo-targeting capabilities is dependent upon each individual
CMSP cell site topology. Section 3.2.1 below provides additional details on current geo-
targeting capabilities.
With regard to WEA Alert Message length, the currently deployed WEA offerings by Alert
Originators, FEMA, and CMSPs in the United States abide by the 90-character maximum
message length required by the FCC regulations and supported in the industry standards.
Section 3.2.2 below provides additional details on the current 90-character maximum length
for a WEA Alert Message.
Section 3.2.3 below provides details on the derivation of WEA Alert Message content.
Message content is the responsibility of the Alert Originator. The currently deployed WEA
offerings by CMSPs in the United States support transmission of the WEA Alert Message
content as provided on the interface to the CMSP from the FEMA Federal Alert Gateway.
The CMSPs do not alter the content of the WEA Alert Message provided by the Federal
Alert Gateway, and transmit the WEA Alert Message content as received with no
modifications by the CMSP network.
3.2.1 Current Geo-Targeting Capabilities
The term “geo-targeting” refers to the method used for an Alert Originator to identify the
alert area and for a CMSP to broadcast the WEA Alert Message to a geographical area that
best approximates the alert area. The method used to identify an alert area within the Alert
Originator system differs from the method used to identify the broadcast area within the
CMSP infrastructure. For example, within the Alert Originator system, the alert area may be
identified in the form of a list of counties, polygons or circles. In the CMSP infrastructure,
the alert area may be identified in the form of addressable radio transmission sites (e.g., cell
sites and/or sectors). Basically, the CMSP infrastructure determines the cell sites/sectors that
will broadcast the alert message to a best approximation of an alert area specified by the
Alert Originators. More specifically, the term “alert area” refers to the counties, polygons,
and circles and the term “broadcast area” refers to the list of cell sites and sectors within the
CMSP infrastructure. Additional examples of alert broadcast with emphasis on geo-targeting
aspects are provided in Appendix E.
3.2.1.1 Alert Area
Referring to Figure 1, the Alert Originator sends the alert area information to the Federal
Alert Gateway over the A & B interface along with other alert information using the
Common Alerting Protocol (CAP). The Federal Alert Gateway sends the alert area
information to the CMSP Gateway (CMSP-GW) over the C-interface (see Figure 1) per
ATIS/TIA standard J-STD-101. Within the CMSP infrastructure, the CMSP-GW sends the
Page 8The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
alert area information to the Cell Broadcast Center (CBC) as per the standard ATIS-
07000082.
J-STD-101 defines that the Federal Alert Gateway passes the alert area information to the
CMSP Gateway as a combination of one or more of the following geographic references:
 CMAS_geocode
 CAP_geocode
 Geographic Names Information Systems (GNIS)
 Polygon
 Circle
J-STD-101 defines that the Federal Alert Gateway shall include at least one instance of
CMAS_geocode. In the present version of the standards, the inclusion of other methods of
defining the alert area is optional and as such the CMSP may or may not support the alert
area information in forms other than the CMAS_geocode. However, polygon and circle geo-
targeting options are supported by the major US wireless operators.
2 ATIS-0700008 defines the functionalities for 3GPP based systems such as GSM, UMTS and LTE and not the
3GPP2 based systems such as CDMA and CMDA2000.
Page 9The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
3.2.1.1.1 CMAS_geocode
An alert area in the form of CMAS_geocode is basically an extension of FIPS (Federal
Information Processing Standard) code and is identified with a 5 character-set, uniquely
assigned to a county, region or other equivalent entity. J-STD-101 states that the first two
characters of geocode identify the state or region and the last three characters identify the
counties, regions or equivalent entities. When the alert area includes the entire country
(USA), the geocode value of “00000” is used. When the alert area includes an entire state,
the first two characters are used to identify the state followed by three zeroes.

3.2.1.1.2 CAP_geocode
An alert area in the form of CAP_geocode is passed by the Federal Alert Gateway to the
CMSP Gateway if the Federal Alert Gateway receives such information from the Alert
Originator in the CAP. CAP_geocode consists of six characters and is represented by
“PSSCCC” where CCC is the code used to identify the counties, regions or specific entities,
and SS is the code used to identify the state or region and P is used to subdivide a county into
smaller regions. The contents of the CAP_geocode are defined in the CAP.

3.2.1.1.3 GNIS
An alert area in the form of GNIS is identified with a geographic code as per the United
States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information Systems (GNIS).
Basically, this method should be used when a specific point of interest that has a unique code
to be used as an alert area.

3.2.1.1.4 Polygon
An alert area in the form of Polygon is identified with a series of vertices. Each vertex is
identified by a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates. The first and last pairs of
coordinates are the same values. Additionally, J-STD-101 states that up to 100 points may be
used to specify a polygon as the alert area.

An alert area in the form of Circle is represented by a central point given as a coordinate pair
and a radius value.

The mapping of Circle to broadcast area is calculated for each circle based alert area
provided.
3.2.1.2 Broadcast Area
Within the CMSP infrastructure, a WEA is broadcast using Cell Broadcast Service (CBS).
The Cell Broadcast is a technique used for simultaneous delivery of a message (not
necessarily a WEA Alert Message) to multiple users in a specific area.
For CBS based message transmission, the minimum area to which a CBS message can be
broadcast is a Cell; and the maximum area to which a CBS message can be broadcast is a list
of many Cells. For CBS, a Cell identifies a Sector.
The CBC determines Cells that belong to the broadcast area. The CBC sends the list of Cells
Page 14The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
to the broadcasting nodes.
A Cell that belongs to a broadcast area can be determined in at least three ways:
 Based on the location of the physical tower.
 Based on the geographic center (centroid) of the Sector.
 Based upon the radio propagation characteristics of the Cell.
A tower is considered to be within the alert area, if the geographical coordinates of the tower
lie within the alert area. A Sector is considered to be within the alert area, if the centroid of
the Sector is within the alert area. A Cell is considered to be within the alert area if the
estimated radio propagation coverage area overlaps the alert area. There may be other
methods implemented to determine the Cells that belong to an alert area.
3.2.2 Current WEA Alert Message Length
In the existing FCC Part 10 WEA rules, the WEA Alert Message length is limited to 90
characters, regardless of the commercial mobile wireless technology or the commercial
mobile service provider that provides the WEA. This was done based on recommendations of
the CMSAAC to ensure consumers have a common user experience regardless of the device
or network. WEA is not to be a “competitive” service across CMSPs, but rather a public
service. To that end, the message length was adopted based on the technology with the most
restrictive limitation; CDMA2000 in this case. The technology constraints behind this
message length limitation exist in deployed networks and have not changed since the
CMSAAC analysis. This section will provide a brief technical analysis behind this limitation,
confirming the CMSAAC findings. The issues and challenges with the current message
length capabilities are discussed in Section 3.3.2.
There are many factors which control the length of a CDMA2000 Broadcast SMS message.
The first of these is the speed of the paging channel. If the paging channel is 4800 bps, which
is commonly used/deployed for other technical reasons, then the available size of the user
part will be 111 octets. However, if the paging channel is 9600 bps rate, then the user part
size is 203 octets.
Furthermore, the user part may also include a number of parameters for other purposes. In
addition to the actual text message, TIA-637-D standards allows for:
 Service category (like the Message ID in GSM)
 Priority of the message (Normal, Urgent, Emergency)
 Language for the text
 Call Back Number (likely not used in WEA)
 Alert on Message Delivery
 Message Display Mode
 Broadcast Zone ID (where to transmit the message)
Page 15The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
If the paging channel is the 9600 bps type, then in the simplest case, wherein the message is a
normal priority, in English, with a message center time stamp, 35 octets are needed for
parameters and 168 octets are available for the actual message. For 7-bit encoded characters
this would result in 192 characters. On the other hand if additional parameters are used
(unlikely for WEA), only 139 octets are available for the message. For 7-bit encoded
characters this would result in 159 characters.
If the paging channel is the often used and commonly deployed 4800 bps type, then using 35
octets for parameters leaves 76 octets for the actual message. For 7-bit encoded characters
this would result in 86 characters for the message itself. With further removal of some
unnecessary parameters, the 90 character limit in CDMA2000 for WEA was chosen and led
to the CMSAAC recommendation which ultimately was adopted in the FCC Part 10 rules for
WEA.
As mentioned earlier, this limitation does not exist in other commercial mobile wireless
technologies, such as GSM, UMTS and LTE. Furthermore, LTE is capable of broadcasting
more than 90 characters which will be discussed later in this report.
3.2.3 Current Methodologies for Derivation of Message Content
This section describes the current FCC Part 10 rules for the derivation of the message content
of WEA Alert Messages. The issues and challenges of the current message content are
discussed in Section 3.3.3.
The FCC Commercial Mobile Service Alert Advisory Committee (CMSAAC) was given the
assignment to develop recommendations for the alert message content. The needs for
individuals with disabilities were considered and evaluated by the CMSAAC in consultation
with various advocates for the individuals with disabilities.
The CMSAAC, based on input from consumer stakeholder groups including those
representing individuals with disabilities, recommended that the alert messages contain the
following information in the order listed:
1. What is happening
2. What area is affected – typically the phrase “in this area” since the affected area is the
broadcast area
3. When the alert expires
4. What action should be taken
5. Who is sending the alert
The CMSAAC also recommended that the following guidelines for the generation of the alert
message content:
 Alert Message Content Generated from CAP Message Parameters -- The
CMSAAC report proposed guidelines for the automated generation of the alert
Page 16The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
message content based upon the values of the associated CAP message. Annex A of
the Joint ATIS/TIA Federal Alert Gateway to CMSP Gateway Interface Specification
(J-STD-101) contains guidelines for the generation of the alert message in English
from the CAP parameters, identifies the CAP parameters to be used for the message
generation, and associates CAP parameter values with the recommended phrase for
the alert message. Annex A of the ATIS Implementation Guidelines for CMAS
Supplemental Information Retrieval (ATIS-0700012) contains similar guidelines for
the generation of Spanish alert messages from the CAP message.
 Free Form Message Content – The CMSAAC report also proposed the generation
of free-form alert messages. The CMSAAC recommended that free-form be used for
Presidential and Child Abduction alerts and that free-form for Imminent Threat alert
messages be used only after the Alert Originators had been sufficiently trained on the
generation of free-form alert messages. The CMSAAC also recommended that the
free-form alert messages should contain the five components described above and in
the recommended order.
For both the generated and the free-form formats of the alert message, there are restrictions
on the alert message content. These restrictions were recommended by the CMSAAC after
studying the effects on CMSP infrastructure and are defined in the FCC First Report and
Order (FCC-08-99A1) and the 47 C.F.R. Part 10 as follows:
“§ 10.440 Embedded Reference Prohibition.
A CMAS Alert Message processed by a Participating CMS Provider must not include
an embedded Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which is a reference (an address) to
a resource on the Internet, or an embedded telephone number. This prohibition does
not apply to Presidential Alerts.”
3.3 Issues and Challenges with Current WEA
This section describes the issues and challenges of the current WEA which are associated
with geo-targeting, message character lengths, and message content.
3.3.1 Issues and Challenges with Current Geo-targeting
From the Alert Originator’s perspective, ideally all WEA-enabled mobile devices in the
geographic area affected by an emergency event would receive the WEA Alert Message
broadcast, and no mobile devices outside the defined alert area would receive those particular
WEA Alert Message broadcasts. From the Alert Originator’s perspective, the more mobile
devices outside the affected alert area that receive the WEA Alert Message broadcast, the
less precise the geo-targeting.
However, this ideal case cannot be realized using currently deployed Cell Broadcast alone
since a cellular network is designed and optimized to handle commercial mobile
telecommunications services, and is not designed nor intended to be an optimal geo-targeted
emergency alert dissemination network. As a voluntary service offered to Alert Originators
and the public, the tools available within the cellular networks will come with limitations.
Page 17The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
3.3.1.1 Realities of Geo-Targeting
The cellular network using currently deployed Cell Broadcast alone can only perform an
approximation of the alert area. The quality of the cellular network approximation is
dependent on many factors including but not limited to the following:
1. Location of the cell tower in relationship to the alert area.
2. Size of the cell radius which is determined by:
a. RF propagation characteristics
b. RF power output from the antenna which may vary
c. Antenna placement and orientation
The placement of cell towers is also based upon many factors including but not limited to the
following:
1. RF propagation studies by the cellular operator’s network operations departments.
2. Subscriber density (e.g., urban, suburban, or rural).
3. Frequency bands of the licensed spectrum to be used by the cell tower (e.g., 700 MHz
bands vs. 1800 MHz bands).
4. Mobile phone traffic patterns which vary based upon time of day and date of week.
For example, during the evening commute for each business day, the mobile device
usage could shift from the downtown office buildings to the commuter routers and
then to the suburban locations. The reverse traffic pattern shift could occur during the
morning commute of each business day.
5. Geography and terrain are major factors to both RF propagation and cell tower
placement. For example, is the terrain flat and open or is it hilly and tree covered?
Does the geography include significant bodies of water?
6. In addition to factors based upon the laws of physics such as those listed above, there
are non-technical factors such as zoning, permits, and jurisdictional restrictions which
impact the placement and potentially the coverage area of cell towers (e.g., power
restrictions).
Consequently, currently deployed Cell Broadcast based geo-targeting will not be consistent
across any operator’s network or across different operator’s networks. The geo-targeting
may vary depending on where the alert area happens to be in relationship to the operator’s
cell towers.
3.3.1.2 Overshooting and Undershooting the Alert Area
Because of RF propagation characteristics, there will be overshoot and undershoot of the
desired alert area. This expectation of overshoot and undershoot is true even if only cell
towers within the specified alert area broadcast the WEA Alert Message. The size of the
overshoot and undershoot cannot be fully predicted as it is dependent on the specified alert
Page 18The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
area, the cell tower placements, and the cell tower configurations at the time of the alert.
Another consideration impacting overshooting and undershooting the alert area is how the
cell towers are selected for the broadcast of the WEA Alert Message. For example, are only
cell towers located within the alert area selected to broadcast WEA Alert Message?
Alternatively, are cell towers located within the alert area selected as well on cell towers on
the border of the alert area and perhaps “just outside” of the alert area?
3.3.1.3 Geo-targeting Using Only Cell Towers within the Polygon
One option for geo-targeting is to select only the cell towers located within the alert area as
shown in the figure below:
Figure 7: Geo-Targeting With Only Cell Sites Inside Polygon
As shown in the above figure, the selection of cell towers only within the alert area may
result in a larger undershoot of the notification to mobile devices within the alert area. The
end result of this larger undershoot of WEA Alert Message broadcast is that the WEA Alert
Messages may not be received by all potentially reachable individuals within the alert area.
Figure 8 shows the worst case where no broadcasts would occur because there are no cell
sites in the alert area.
Page 19The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Figure 8: Geo-Targeting With Only Cell Sites Inside Polygon – Worst Case
This worst case scenario could occur under the following types of conditions:
1. In rural areas, because of the low subscriber density and the flat terrain in many rural
parts of the country, cell coverage could be provided by cell towers with very large
cell radii (e.g., multiple miles). The nickname for this type of cell towers is “boomer”
and they could have a cell radius as large as 20 miles or more. Consequently, the cell
towers could be many miles apart and it is possible that the alert area polygon could
fall entirely between the cell towers as shown in the above figure. Very small alert
polygons in rural areas are particularly susceptible to this condition.
2. There are jurisdictions which do not allow for the construction of cell towers within
their jurisdictional boundaries. Cell coverage for such jurisdictions is provided by
cell towers outside the jurisdictional boundaries with cellular coverage overlapping
within the jurisdictional boundaries. If the alert area was the jurisdictional boundary
or within the jurisdictional boundary then no cell sites would be selected for the WEA
broadcast.
3.3.1.4 Geo-targeting Using Cell Towers Inside and Just outside the Polygon
The amount of undershoot of the alert area might be reduced by using cell towers on the
border of the alert area or just outside the alert area in addition to the cell towers within the
alert area as shown in the following figure:
Page 20The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Figure 9: Geo-Targeting With Cell Sites Inside and Just Outside Polygon
As shown in the above figure, the amount of undershoot of coverage within the alert area
could be reduced significantly from just using cell sites within the alert area. However, as
also shown in the above figure, the possibility of undershooting the alert area still exists.
By utilizing both the cell towers within the alert area as well as cell towers on the boundary
or just outside the alert area, the potential of subscribers within the alert area to receive the
WEA Alert Message would be maximized. However, there could be a significant increase in
the amount of overshooting that occurs. The extent of the overshooting is dependent on the
coverage area of the cell towers on the border of the alert area or just outside the alert area.
The number of mobile devices outside of the alert area that would receive the WEA Alert
Message is currently unpredictable because it is based on cell tower location and
characteristics in relation to the alert area.
3.3.1.5 The Geo-targeting Trade-Off
There is a geo-targeting tradeoff that occurs with cell broadcast. The goal is to maximize
receipt of the WEA Alert Message by mobile devices within the alert area while minimizing
receipt of the alert on mobile devices located outside of the alert area. Cell broadcast based
geo-targeting refers to the process of broadcasting the WEA Alert Message from a selected
set of radio towers whose collective coverage area is deemed to best approximate the targeted
area defined by the Alert Originator. In particular, cell broadcast based geo-targeting does
not entail mobile device assistance.
Page 21The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Cell broadcast based geo-targeting constrains the WEA Alert Message broadcast to the best
approximation of the alert area given the potential levels of overshoot and undershoot. Due
to the underlying CMSP network capabilities, the laws of physics, the impacts of potentially
varying geographical, topographical, and environmental conditions (e.g., sunspots, terrain,
time of day, airborne particulate matter) and other characteristics of RF propagation, there
will not be a 100% match of the RF propagation area and the WEA alert area. Consequently,
there will be the potential of “overshoot” and “undershoot” between the WEA alert area and
the RF broadcast of the WEA Alert Messages. As part of the trade-off evaluation, the
acceptable level of “overshoot” and “undershoot” needs to be considered.
There is no “one size fits all” approach or solution for cell broadcast based geo-targeting.
There will always be overshoot and undershoot and the degree of such is not fully predictable
and will likely vary among CMSPs.
3.3.2 Issues and Challenges with Current Character Lengths
The CMSAAC report described the technical considerations for the 90 character WEA Alert
Message. The CMAS First Report and Order from 2008 says some "commenters raised
concerns that a 90 character limit would not provide sufficient information to subscribers
about emergencies." Concern about the limitation has been raised by alert originators in
multiple forums and through feedback to the Federal government; and has been validated in
studies.
In 2010, the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS
S&T)3 sponsored a workshop, titled “Current Knowledge and Research Gaps Workshop on
Public Response to Alerts and Warnings on Mobile Devices.”4 The workshop’s report
concluded that while much information existed on what constitutes effective alert and
warning messages, less was known about systems that deliver small amount of information,
such as SMS text messages and 90-character WEA Alert Messages. Based on the report’s
findings and presentations during the workshop, a list of research topics that should be
addressed was provided, which included two research topics related to WEA Alert Message
length:
 How does a 90-character limit for alerts constrain the ability to provide the public
with alerts? What implications does a 90-character limit have on for public response?
 Can such a short message provide enough information to let individuals know that a
significant event has taken place? Does it provide enough information for individuals
to obtain additional information and take appropriate action to protect themselves?
3 As detailed in Section 4.2, the WARN tasked DHS S&T to oversee research, development, test and evaluation
(RDT&E) activities that address WEA geo-targeting and improve public response.
4 Workshop was conducted through a contract with the National Academy of Sciences, National Research
Council’s (NRC’s) Committee on Public Response to Alerts and Warnings on Mobile Devices. It was held on
April 13 and 14, 2010. The purpose of the workshop was to examine current knowledge and research on how
the public responds to alerts and warning with a specific focus on mobile alerting, examine related work on
mobile and text messaging, and identify research gaps relevant to the CMAS (WEA) program. DHS S&T had
two goals of the workshop: 1) Present what is currently known about public response to alerts and warnings and
how that relates to the design, operation, and future development of CMAS (WEA); and 2) identify any gaps in
the research.
Page 22The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
During 2013 and 2014, DHS S&T funded multiple research projects to address the questions
above (among others). The first study is titled “Comprehensive Testing of Imminent Threat
Public Messages for Mobile Devices”5.
Preliminary findings from that study include that short messages offer less to manage public
alert and warning response than longer messages; and that shorter messages don’t contain
enough information to help people overcome pre-conceptions about different hazards based
on personal experience, perceived risk, and knowledge, which likely will not match the event
they face. (Section 4.2, which provides a summary of DHS studies on mobile alerting,
contains additional findings from the report; and Appendix B contains a more detailed report
of the findings.)
3.3.3 Issues and Challenges with Current Message Content
The report from the 2010 workshop, “Current Knowledge and Research Gaps Workshop on
Public Response to Alerts and Warnings on Mobile Devices” (see Section 3.3.2) notes that a
model of an effective alert and warning system should include event detection, message
dissemination, message receipt, and response. Box 1, below, provides information gathered
from the workshop related to how much information should be included in an alert and/or
warning message and what type of content should be included.
5 This research was supported by the DHS S&T Directorate through Contract Award Number HSHQDC-10-A-
BOA36/HSHQDC-12-J-00145 made to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to
Terrorism (START). The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should
not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security, or START, wireless vendors, wireless network operators, or wireless service
providers.
Page 23The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
BOX 1
The Warning Process: Message Receipt and Response by the Public
Below is a list of steps that the affected population takes during a crisis or emergency
following the receipt of an alert and/or warning message.
 Receive the warning—People must physically receive the warning.
 Understand the warning – Once people receive a warning they must be able to
process the message and understand what it means.
 Believe the warning is credible—People must believe that the source of the warning
is reliable and the threat could materialize.
 Confirm the threat—People must take steps in order to verify that the threat described
in the warning is real.
 Personalize the threat—People must believe that the threat is something that can
potentially affect them.
 Determine whether or not protective action is needed—People need to decide if they
need to take action.
 Determine whether protective action is feasible—People need to decide if they are
able to take action.
 Decide if you have the resources to take protective action—people need to have the
resources to actually do what is required.
Thus, the alert recipient must understand the alert, believe it to be credible, have supporting
information, and believe the threat is something that can affect them before they will take the
prescribed action in the alert.
Additionally, the workshop identified the following list of research topics related to message
content that should be addressed:
 What are the message characteristics that lead to effective instruction in crisis
situations?
 What does the public want the alert or warning message to say? What do they need
to hear?
 To what extent will CMAS (WEA) alerts trigger information-seeking behaviors, and
what forms will such behavior take? Might that information-seeking behavior end up
leading to the network overloads that CMSAAC voiced concern about?
 To what extent can results of research on social media be applied to gaining an
understanding of what the public response to CMAS (WEA) alerts might be?
 How might social media factor into CMAS (WEA) and other official message
dissemination?
Page 24The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
 How will public education initiatives need to be designed to help?
Preliminary findings from the 2013/2014 “Comprehensive Testing of Imminent Threat
Public Messages for Mobile Devices” study (see Section 3.3.2) include:
 The use of acronyms, in place of spelling out words, may limit the effectiveness of
the message.
 The phrase “in this area” does not effectively communicate who is at risk. Each WEA
that states “in this area” but does not apply to the individual receiving the message
may train message receivers that “in this area” may not apply to them.
 The public may not understand terms such as shelter and evacuate.
3.4 Status of Wireless Network Deployment
U.S. wireless carriers continue to tirelessly build out 4G wireless networks, with some having
nearly completed their LTE deployment. AT&T Inc. has deployed LTE in more than 500
markets,6 and its LTE network now covers more than 300 million people.7 AT&T’s 4G LTE
build was reported “essentially complete” by the summer 2014.8 As of January 2014, Sprint
had rolled out LTE in 340 markets nationwide,9 and Sprint’s LTE network covered more
than 200 million people as of February 2014.10 Sprint has also announced “Sprint Spark,” a
tri-band LTE configuration that it plans to deploy in 100 U.S. cities over the next three
years.11 T-Mobile’s 4G LTE network covers 250 million people and the company has
announced its expectation to expand its coverage to 300 million people in 2015.12 And
Verizon Wireless has implemented LTE in at least 500 markets covering 303 million people
(95 percent of the U.S. population),13 noting that it had “virtually wrapped up its
deployment” as of June 2013.14
Regional carriers have also aggressively constructed 4G networks. U.S. Cellular, through its

4.1 Assumptions and Objectives for Enhancing WEA
The assumptions and goals for enhancing WEA include the following:

Report October 2014
 The goal of enhancing WEA is to make WEA more useful to the public and the Alert
Originator community based on:
o What the industry has learned since WEA was launched in April 2012.
o The results of WEA research sponsored by the Department of Homeland
Security.
o Design constraints within the end-to-end WEA ecosystem.
 WEA enhancements would have to be developed on an end-to-end basis and must
take into account impacts to the A, B, C and D interfaces as well as the hardware and
software used to support these interfaces (See Figure 1). In particular, WEA
enhancements must not cause or promote network congestion in the wireless network,
as there are severe spectrum constraints.
 Legacy LTE handsets as well as 2G and 3G networks/handsets will continue to be
capable of the Classic WEA deployed today. Legacy LTE handsets may or may not
support enhanced WEA capabilities.
 Enhanced WEA may require that two versions of WEA co-exist for an undetermined
period of time. Classic WEA (what is deployed today) must co-exist along with the
new and improved enhanced WEA, as described within this report.
 Enhanced WEA features may require the customer to have an enhanced WEA
capable mobile device. Enhanced WEA capable mobile devices should be capable of
receiving Classic WEA Alert Messages when enhanced WEA is not available.
 Enhanced WEA would continue to be a voluntary election by CMSPs whereby the
CMSPs would provide the FCC with their election choice and their implementation
timeline for enhanced WEA.
4.2 Summary of DHS Studies on Mobile Alerting
The WARN Act tasked the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology
Directorate (DHS S&T) to partner with academia, the private sector, government labs, and
others to perform research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) activities that address
WEA geo-targeting and improve public response. Accordingly, DHS S&T funded multiple
studies in this area. Some of the studies have concluded while others are still underway.
Nevertheless, the outcomes from the completed studies underscore the issues and challenges
with current WEA character length, content and geo-targeting.
The preliminary findings of the research on “Comprehensive Testing of Imminent Threat
Public Messages for Mobile Devices” not only clarify the issues and challenges associated
with WEA, but also contain the following findings regarding improvements to WEA:
 Adjusting the order of elements in a 90 or 140 character alert message to source,
guidance, hazard, location, and time may improve public response.
 Having a local and recognizable source in the 90-character message may help
personalize the message and improve protective action-taking.
 Consideration should be given to discontinue the use of acronyms, educate the public
Page 27The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
about their meaning, or increase the message length to allow for full text descriptions.
 The effectiveness of WEA Alert Messages may remain suppressed until they can be
distributed to finer geospatial targeted populations so that messages only reach the
people who are at risk.
 Inclusion of a map showing the threat area map and the recipient’s location helps
personalize the threat and could improve protective action-taking. Inclusion of a map
without the recipient’s location may serve to confuse the recipient.
 Consideration should be given to inclusion of a URL, since there is a long-standing
historical observation that people engage in a search for additional information before
taking protective action. It remains unclear if inclusion of a URL might reduce or
increase the delay in taking a protective action after message receipt.
 WEA Alert Messages should describe basic alert and warning concepts to the extent
possible.
 Sound, color, size, shape, and style could all potentially influence WEA Alert
Message interpretation and subsequent response but it is not yet known how.
The findings above are consistent with previous studies which conclude that personalizing
the threat improves protective action-taking. Appendix B contains a more detailed report of
the findings.
4.2.1 Commentary and Improvements Desired by Alert Originators
Alert origination members of the working group most desire that the general public take life-
saving decisive action in response to WEA and wish to act on suggestions made by the study.
The study suggests that the alert origination community should help improve WEA in the
following ways to better personalize the threat and save lives.
 Optimize the order of WEA Alert Message content. This optimized ordering of the
WEA Alert Message content should also consider the CMSAAC report and other
studies to reflect the needs of all user communities including individuals with
disabilities.
 Incorporate a local and recognizable source in the WEA Alert Message.
 Use the clearest possible language in WEA Alert Messages given message length
constraints.
 Use language in the WEA Alert Message that best conveys who is at risk given
message length constraints.
The study suggests that improvements to WEA capabilities would enable better
personalization of the threat by Alert Originators and help save lives. In line with the results
of the study, Alert Originators request that WEA be improved as follows:
 Increase the maximum allowable WEA Alert Message length.
 Distribute WEA Alert Messages to finer geospatial targeted populations so that
messages only reach the people who are at risk.
Page 28The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
 Include a clickable link that directs WEA recipients to more details about the alert.
 Incorporate an image showing the threat area and the recipient’s location. For
AMBER Alerts, the image would be of the child and/or abductor. “That would be a
huge improvement” according to Robert Hoever, Director of the Missing Children
Division at National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
 Provide a greater range of accessibility for all recipients of WEA Alert Messages,
including those who are physically disabled. A separate working group should be
established to address accessibility since additional research and expertise by
members of the accessibility community is necessary to better understand how sound,
color, size, shape, and style could influence WEA Alert Message interpretation.
4.2.2 Commentary by Wireless Industry
While the DHS research does offer some insight into possible enhancements that can
improve the recipient’s understanding and confidence in the alert message, there is still
further research that needs to be performed before final recommendations and standards
changes are developed.
The following questions should guide further research:
1. It was mentioned that a “map” gave the recipient of the alert more confidence in the
alert message. What would be the impact to the recipient’s confidence level in the
WEA Alert Message if there was further education/outreach on WEA explaining the
purpose and that it comes from a local, trusted source?
2. Has the research looked at all communities of users including individuals with
disabilities?
3. There was mention of the “branding” of WEA and that it may not be clear if the
displayed message was from a local source or “WEA”. If the display screen
specifically mentioned the source of the information (i.e., the local agency or NWS)
with less or no emphasis on “WEA” branding, would this give the recipient
confidence in the WEA Alert Message?
4. The map is used to depict the “in this area” portion of the WEA Alert Message. If
WEA is enhanced to allow for 280 displayable characters (subject to technology
analysis by ATIS) and can better describe the impacted are, is a map not necessary?
5. The research did not evaluate the actionable points in the WEA Alert Message. What
is the impact and user interpretation for all possible actionable instructions that could
be in a WEA Alert Message (e.g., shelter in place, take cover now, evacuate, etc.)?
There is concern that a map may add confusion for evacuations, shelter in place, etc.
6. What are the potential side effects and potential ancillary consequences (e.g.,
accident) when trying to read a map to user under all circumstances – driving, etc.?
7. What are the effectiveness and possible consequences if the WEA Alert Message was
displayed on the car’s dashboard or other vehicle display instead of or in addition to
being displayed on the mobile device? Also what would be the effectiveness and
possible consequences if text-to-speech is used instead of displaying on the vehicle
dashboard or display?
Page 29The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
8. What is the impact to mobile device user actions and confidence in WEA and the
WEA map if the user location cannot be determined – or if a map is only displayed
sometimes (such as when location is available)?
9. A map provides technical challenges. What level of detail is needed on a map and
how does the level of detail affect the recipient’s understanding and response for both
local residents and first time visitors to the alert area indicated on the map?
10. It was mentioned that several of the subjects interpreted the marker on the map as the
place they need to travel to in order to shelter in place. How should the maps be
formatted so that the marker is clearly understood to be their current location instead
of the location they need to travel to?
11. How do the subjects interpret the maps as related to the action in the WEA Alert
Message? For example, if the WEA Alert Message indicates “evacuate” do the
subjects interpret the map as the location to evacuate from or as the location to
evacuate to?
12. How effective are the WEA Alert Messages for the elderly and for individuals with
disabilities? For example, if the alert area is provided in only graphical format (e.g.,
map), how do recipients with vision impairments determine the alert area?
13. If the WEA alert occurs in the middle of the night when the recipients are probably
sleeping, would a map or a text based WEA Alert Message be more effective?
14. What is the effectiveness of color on the WEA alert maps to indicate location and
polygon including the effectiveness and impact for individuals who are partially or
fully color blind?
15. Will the inclusion of clickable URLs in a WEA Alert Message increase or decrease
“milling” of users searching for additional internet information related to the alert via
their favorite trusted news sources?
16. If it is believed that users will “mill” for internet information after receiving a
particular WEA Alert Message regardless of whether a clickable URL is included in
the WEA Alert Message, then does it make sense to leave alert area maps to those
other news sources?
17. As the WEA alert has a special alert tone or vibration cadence to differentiate these
messages from a normal text message or email message, does it make sense to allow
users to read these messages while driving (e.g., driving in tornado alley when a
tornado alert is issued) even in jurisdictions in which reading text messages is
disallowed by law?
18. The research should design experiments that display alert messages on various types
of commercially available mobile device screens rather then on computer emulations,
in order for users to see the “look and feel” of real devices.
19. The research should explore the user experience in non-“sunny day” scenarios, such
as working with CMSPs to understand and emulating real-life impacts of network
congestion. This can be emulated in the experiment by introducing delays when
clicking on links or browsing for data, not displaying maps due to location not being
available, etc.

Report October 2014
4.3 Analysis and Findings on WEA Alert Message Length
Consistent with findings from the DHS studies on mobile alerting, that the current maximum
90-character length of WEA Alert Messages constrains public understanding of the
messages, Alert Originators have expressed a desire to increase the existing 90-character
limit on WEA Alert Message length. There was consensus among the group to recommend
the FCC modify their rules to increase the maximum WEA Alert Message length consistent
with capabilities of 4G LTE of 280 displayable characters, subject to technology validation
by ATIS.
The history of the 90-character WEA Alert Message originates at the CMSAAC with input
from a number of consumer stakeholder groups and a desire to have consistency across all
CMS technologies. 90 characters was recommended and ultimately adopted by the FCC.
From the FCC’s First Report & Order for WEA20:
“83. We conclude that, at this initial stage, adoption of a 90 character limit
serves the public interest. We agree with commenters such as MetroPCS that a 90 character
limit will allow all systems to transmit the message with minimal change, and that 90
characters is an effective limit to allow the message to be delivered and actually be read.252 As
the CMSAAC concluded and the Wireless Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center
(WRERC) notes, the 90 character text limit of any CMAS alert is reasonable because the
..CMAS alert is intended to get the attention of a person. The person can then seek out other
media for confirmation of the alert and more information.253“
As technology advanced from 2G/3G GSM/UMTS/CDMA to the convergence with 4G LTE,
the 90 character limit imposed by 2G/3G CMS networks was revisited in this report, and an
analysis of impacts to increasing the message length was undertaken. While the desired
technology solution for increasing WEA Alert Message lengths is through capabilities of the
underlying CMSP infrastructure, other ideas were discussed and summarized in Appendix C.
The following table contains a summary of the message length options discussed in
Appendix C:
Table 3: Summary of Appendix C Options to Increase Message Length
Appendix
Section Message Option Length Title Summary
C.1 WEA Alert Message Length Option This option proposes to increase the maximum length of
1 – Increase Length Using Existing a WEA Alert Message for LTE beyond the current FCC
Underlying CMSP Infrastructure 90 displayable character rule.
Capabilities
C.2 WEA Alert Message Length Option This option proposes concatenation of multiple LTE
2 – Packet-Based Concatenation broadcasted packet based messages to assemble the
longer WEA Alert Message.
C.3 WEA Alert Message Length Option The wireless carrier transmits the original alert message
3 – Message-Based Concatenation as a sequence of complete WEA Alert Messages. The
WEA OS app is programmed to retrieve that sequence
from the WEA inbox, concatenate them, and then present
to the end-user.

Mobile Alert System; April 9, 2008.
Page 31The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Appendix
Section Message Option Length Title Summary
C.4 WEA Alert Message Length Option The original alert message is partitioned into multiple
4 – Human-Based Concatenation smaller (90 displayable character maximum) alert
messages before delivery to the CMSP, adding page
numbers to each of the smaller alert messages [e.g., (1/3),
(2/3), (3/3)]. Therefore, the original alert message is
delivered to the CMSP as multiple individual WEA Alert
Messages, and the end-user is relied upon to read them in
the correct order.
C.5 WEA Alert Message Length Option Today, the CMSP infrastructure including the radio
5 – Fewer Bits per Character elements uses an internationally standardized and
recognized 7-bits-per-character encoding scheme (3GPP
TS 23.038), resulting in a maximum of 630 bits in a 90
displayable character FCC defined WEA Alert Message.
It is possible, if defined in global standards, to use
alternate character sets that use fewer bits per character.
C.6 WEA Alert Message Length Option Upon receiving the existing 90 displayable character
6 – Downloading Over Cellular WEA Alert Message, the mobile device can be
Connection programmed to treat the cell broadcast reception of a
WEA Alert Message as a trigger to fetch more detailed
information from a trusted source using the mobile
device's cellular data connection.
C.7 WEA Alert Message Length Option Upon receiving the existing 90 displayable character
7 – Downloading Over WiFi WEA Alert Message, the mobile device can be
Connection programmed to treat the cell broadcast reception of a
WEA Alert Message as a trigger to fetch more detailed
information from a trusted source using the mobile
device's WiFi connection (if available).
Option C.1 leverages underlying CMSP Infrastructure capabilities. Options C.2 through C.7
are of varying complexity and potentially greater cost. All options would require varying
degrees of further research, technical analysis and industry standardization. The FCC should
remain technology neutral and allow technology choices to be decided by Participating CMS
Providers and industry standards organizations. As future industry standards evolve which
address the number of displayable characters in a WEA Alert Message, the concepts
presented in Appendix C should be reviewed.
Taking into consideration the voluntary nature of WEA, CMSP infrastructure technology
evolution, market drivers, economic considerations, and handset churn, wireless industry
members advise that for legacy 2G/3G CMS networks, there are no practical options to
increase the message length beyond the 90 character limit imposed by the underlying CMS
infrastructure and deployed technology. Some concepts presented in Appendix C would
appear to be applicable to the legacy systems, but those concepts would require feasibility
studies, industry standards development, CMS Provider infrastructure and/or mobile device
changes (i.e., new mobile devices) which, given the rapid pace of LTE deployments, make
retrofitting the legacy systems impractical.
However, 4G LTE, which rapidly has become the predominant technology deployed across
nearly all CMSPs, offers the capability to increase the WEA Alert Message length beyond
Page 32The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
the 90 character limit of 2G/3G CMS networks. The standards-based LTE technology, with
some additional standards and infrastructure implementation changes, supports more than 90
characters and what is likely to be 280 characters as described in option C.1. The term
“likely” is used because all LTE page/segment size numbers discussed in this document are
subject to review/modifications by national and international standards bodies.
With a displayable character-limit increase for LTE, there will be a requirement for Alert
Originators to provide both a 90-character WEA Alert Message to accommodate legacy
CMSP infrastructure and mobile devices, and the longer 280-character WEA Alert Message
for LTE. Until Alert Originators upgrade their systems, the Alert Originators may only be
able to generate 90 displayable character alert messages even on networks supporting
enhanced WEA.
Dissemination of multiple alert messages to CMSPs will be required since there will be a mix
of capabilities in the deployed base of CMSP infrastructure and mobile devices – some of
which would not be technically capable of transmitting/receiving the longer message. The
methodology for composing messages should be driven by standards and best practices
within the Alert Origination community (including alert origination system software
developers), along with FEMA, since the message has to be delivered to the Federal Alert
Gateway (using the CAP protocol).
In addition, Participating CMS Providers have to be presented with both a 90 displayable
character WEA Alert Message and the longer 280 displayable character WEA Alert Message
across the “C” interface. This requires modifications to the following:
 International and joint ATIS/TIA standards
 Federal Alert Gateway
 CMSP Gateway and CMSP infrastructure
 Mobile devices and mobile device behavior
CMSPs in collaboration with alert originators and other stakeholders should identify the
maximum practical WEA Alert Message length from a human factor, alerting psychology,
and technology capability.
4.4 Analysis and Findings on Message Content
In general terms, a message is a communication of information. Electronic messages may be
composed of text, graphics, audio, and/or video content. As described in Section 4.2
Summary of DHS Studies on Mobile Alerting, the research results suggest that textual and
graphical improvements to WEA would better personalize the alert and save lives. Since the
study suggests that further work is necessary to understand how sound would influence WEA
interpretation and video was not studied as part of the research, neither audio nor video
options will be considered in this document.
4.4.1 Textual WEA Alert Message Content
Textual content improvements to WEA could be accomplished by incorporating the results of
Page 33The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
the START study as best practices in the initial and continuing Alert Originator training
conducted by FEMA IPAWS. The training would teach Alert Originators how to:
 Optimize the order of WEA Alert Message content.
 Incorporate a local and recognizable source in the WEA Alert Message.
 Use the clearest possible language in WEA Alert Messages.
 Use language in the WEA Alert Message that best conveys who is at risk.
4.4.2 Graphical WEA Alert Message Content
The type of image which would best personalize the WEA, improve public action-taking, and
save lives depends on the type of alert. As shown in Figure 10, an image for a weather or
evacuation related WEA would show the outline of the defined threat/evacuation area on a
map background. As shown in Figure 11, an image for an AMBER Alert WEA would be an
image of the abducted child or the abductor. Both figures demonstrate that an adequate image
could be achieved in as little as 5 to 10 kB.
Figure 10: Sample GIF image of tornado warning map. Image is 300 x 300 pixels and reduced to 8 colors.
Size is 10 kB. Background map from RadarScope app.
Page 34The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Figure 11: Sample JPEG image of abducted child. Image is 148 x 221 pixels and 60% quality. Size is 5
kB. Image from Microsoft Office.
A popular notion is that the image be pushed to the device. However, the maximum packet
length for LTE is about 0.3 kB. Thus, numerous packets would have to be broadcast and
concatenated on the device in order to achieve a 5 to 10 kB broadcast of the image. Wireless
industry advises that since LTE WEA is only designed for text messages, this would be
complex and impractical using the existing globally standardized and deployed broadcast
technology which uses SystemInformationBlockType12 (SIB12) for WEA [a subset of the
global 3GPP Public Warning System (PWS)] on LTE. SIBs are used to broadcast critical
system information to ensure proper operation of the overall LTE network. SIB12 is a text
only broadcast message that must be kept to a reasonable size to ensure that other more
critical SIBs can be broadcasted in a timely fashion. Wireless industry requested that aspects
of WEA related to multimedia be deferred to the CSRIC IV WG-2 subgroup on Multimedia.
Alternatives for associating an image with the WEA include a clickable link to an image on
an external server, and a device generated map which also shows the recipient’s location.
Alternative 1: Clickable Link to an Image on an External Server
In this alternative, the recipient clicks a link below the WEA Alert Message. This opens the
device’s web browser and displays an image which is hosted on an external server at FEMA
IPAWS. FEMA IPAWS would ensure that the file size of the image is less than an agreed
upon size, such as 10 kB.
The benefits of this alternative are as follows:
 Alert recipients would be directed to additional information which is lightweight,
rather than milling about the web for additional information which may otherwise
strain CMSP network resources.
 The link would be considered a vetted, official, trusted source thereby increasing the
chances that the public will take appropriate action quickly.
The drawbacks of this alternative are as follows:
 Network congestion leading to network and service degradation may result from a
Page 35The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
large number of concurrent point-to-point connections. Thus, subscribers may be
currently unable to retrieve the additional information and/or use other services, such
as 9-1-1.
 A study would be needed to determine if directing the subscriber to an authoritative
source (e.g., “Visit FEMA.gov for more information”) or providing a clickable link to
lightweight alert information from an authoritative source would decrease or increase
congestion compared to the subscriber milling about the web for additional
information when no link is provided. The research should also shed light on
technical options for mitigating potential network congestion associated with a
clickable link.
 Mobile device behavior: If clickable URLs are to be added to WEA Alert Messages,
then new procedures would need to be developed to describe how the mobile device
will handle the presentation of the WEA Alert Message and the content generated by
the clickable URL. For example, procedures would need to be developed in standards
to describe how the user is able to go back and forth between the WEA Alert Message
text and the content generated by the clickable URL to ensure that the WEA Alert
Message text does not disappear after the user clicks on the URL (as it would
disappear on some current WEA mobile device implementations today). Currently, J-
STD-100 (the ATIS/TIA standard for CMAS Mobile Device Behavior)21 specifies
that clickable URLs are not allowed in WEA Alert Messages. If clickable URLs are
to be allowed to support enhanced WEA, then J-STD-100 would need to be modified
to explain procedures for handling clickable URLs in a user-friendly manner.
Message originator considerations must include coordination of WEA alerts and the
content of clickable URLs to avoid user confusion. For example, if the content
provided by a clickable URL provides updated information related to the alert such
that the original alert is effectively rendered obsolete, such updating would need to be
explained fully in the content of the clickable URL, i.e., that the clickable URL
content may supersede the content of the original alert in some cases. Another
message originator consideration is the coordination of WEA Alert Message updates
and the content of the clickable URL.
 The subscriber must have a data services plan.
 There would be no way to display the recipient’s location with respect to the
threat/evacuation area shown in the image, because a simple GIF or JPEG image
contains no geo-reference information and FEMA IPAWS would not know the
recipient’s location. This could be mitigated (since FEMA IPAWS also has the
descriptive text that goes along with the alert) by displaying a mobile friendly web
page which contains the image and textual details of the alert. 2 kB would allow for a
2,000 character description.
Alternative 2: Device Generated Map with Recipient’s Location
Given the expected predominance of LTE over the next few years, as described in the
Section 4.3 Analysis and Findings on WEA Alert Message Length, the maximum usable LTE
packet length of 280 displayable characters is assumed for this alternative. Note that the
21 J-STD-100, Joint ATIS/TIA CMAS Mobile Device Behavior Specification, January 30, 2009. Available at
https://www.atis.org/docstore/default.aspx.
Page 36The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
feasibility of supporting 280 displayable characters is subject technology evaluation by
ATIS/TIA standards.
In this alternative, the latitude/longitude vertices which define the alert area are broadcast to
the device in addition to the standard textual WEA Alert Message. The device uses the
vertices to plot an outline of the alert area over a background map which is resident either on
the device or in a “Display application” on the device. If the recipient has location services
enabled, the recipient’s location may also be plotted on the map as shown in Figure 12.
Figure 12: Polygon based warning with the recipients location plotted as a blue and white circle. Map
background and recipient location from Apple iPhone Maps.
A standards specification would need to be developed by ATIS/TIA in coordination with
FEMA IPAWS (including identification of any Application Programming Interface (API)
Page 37The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
needed for a “Display application”). The enhanced WEA capability will be part of the mobile
device OS; alternatively the Display app could be developed by third party app developers, in
which case a standard API should be made available to app developers. FEMA would
develop such a Display app to represent a baseline or “trusted” app among other third party
offerings. Consideration should also be given to mobile device users who may choose to
download other third party developed Display apps from the appropriate app stores.
ATIS/TIA will standardize the enhanced WEA app, the corresponding APIs for the Display
app, as well as how the mobile device should behave when enhanced WEA is available and
enabled. Activation of the API or enhanced WEA would be subject to CMSP policy.
This alternative results in two messages being pushed via WEA- one for the standard textual
WEA displayable message and the second non-displayable message to provide the geocodes
(e.g., polygon) to the mobile device. The method will be defined in standards [see Appendix
D.5.1 for one example of a method which could be used to package geocodes in an LTE
PWS (WEA) broadcast].
The benefits of this alternative are as follows:
 As stated in the START study, a “high information map…specifying the areas
affected and not affected and the receiver’s location...had a statistically significant
and positive effect on public response outcomes including interpretation and
personalization”.
 The alert recipients would be able to see the image, because little action would be
required by the alert recipient to receive it.
The drawbacks of this alternative are as follows:
 This alternative is not possible on non-LTE networks, and further studies need to be
made to determine feasibility on LTE networks.
 This alternative may only applicable to smartphones and may not be available on
feature phones.
 The recipient’s location cannot be plotted if location services are disabled or the
device is in a location where location services area unavailable. Also, latency in
plotting the device location will result if the device has difficulty establishing the
device location.
 Possibility of perceived privacy issue with using the device’s location services.
 Use of location services may cause battery drain.
 Use of location services by multiple simultaneous devices could have impact on
network resources.
 The subscriber may need a data services plan. Data networks are designed such that
the subscriber must have a data service plan to retrieve data.22
22 A Participating CMSP feasibility study would be needed to investigate the ability to access enhanced WEA
data from a URL without a data services plan. After the completion of the feasibility study, the FCC may
Page 38The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
 The effectiveness is dependent upon the accuracy of the location services.
 Liability and responsibility of the accuracy of the depicted information must be
established.
Wireless industry members request that additional social studies be conducted to understand
any potential consequences of showing a map to the user, as well as identifying how to tie in
the alert text into the map. For example, what does the map indicate and how does it tie into
the desired action such as shelter in place/evacuate/etc. Will the map help the user decide
what to do, or could it cause further confusion? In regard to this concern, the START study
states:
“The results of the qualitative research indicated that inclusion of a high information map
improved most participants’ understanding, belief, and risk personalization across all
message lengths. These findings suggest that there certainly would be a benefit from
adding a high-information map to a WEA Alert Message. Doing so could help the public
interpret and personalize the worded message, which could, in turn, move more people at
risk to take protective action.”
Wireless industry has also raised concern that questions about the meaning of the maps will
overwhelm emergency 9-1-1 call center and that CMSP customer care cannot be responsible
for answering customer questions or interpreting what the information on a map means. See
Section 4.2.2.
The NWS has disseminated polygon based warnings well over 250,000 times since NWS
implementation of polygon based warning on October 1, 2007. Those polygons have been
viewed many millions of times across a variety of mediums including TV, mobile apps, and
other software. While there are no known cases where call centers have been overwhelmed
due to display of the polygon, outreach materials provided by WEA partners and
stakeholders can be updated to enhance public awareness about the use of polygons. Also,
geo-fencing techniques (see Section 4.5 Analysis and Findings on Geo-Targeting,) could be
employed to mitigate cell broadcast bleedover and limit WEA notification to subscribers in
the actual threat area.
4.5 Analysis and Findings on Geo-Targeting
The START study concludes that finer geo-spatial targeting is necessary to ensure WEA
Alert Messages only reach those people at risk, otherwise, people who receive WEA Alert
Messages may be trained to think they don’t apply to them. This section explores various
methods which may improve geographic targeting of alert messages, as defined by the alert
originator, in order to enhance trust in the alert system, responsiveness to the alerts, and
overall public safety.
4.5.1 Current Geographic Targeting
Currently, Participating CMSPs are minimally required to geo-target the WEA broadcast at
choose a policy to require data service at no cost to the subscriber to support retrieval of enhanced WEA
information. It is the position of the CMSP operators that a funding source for the retrieval of enhanced WEA
information from a URL must be identified.
Page 39The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
the county level even if a polygon is defined by the alert originator as the actual alert area.
Some CMSPs have voluntarily enhanced WEA in the following ways to geo-target the WEA
broadcast to the best approximation of the actual alert area given technology capabilities:
1. Geo-target the broadcast to cell sites approximating the polygon (when a polygon is
provided by the alert originator).
2. Broadcast the alert from cell sites based on the overlap of their respective coverage
areas with the defined alert area/polygon.
3. Broadcasting alerts to a subset of sectors within a cell to better match the defined alert
area/polygon.
These enhancements voluntarily introduced by some Participating CMS Providers have
enhanced the geo-targeting to allow best matching of the polygon given the limitations of RF
propagation using cell broadcast technology.
4.5.2 Enhancing WEA Geographic Targeting
Section 4.5 and Appendix D focus on technology concepts which might be employed to
geographically fence the WEA. Thus, a WEA would only be rendered by devices which are,
to the best approximation, within the alert originator’s defined alert area. Appendix D.2
details a list of objectives from the Alert Originator’s perspective to enhance WEA geo-
targeting. While there are feasibility studies required to work out the details, enhanced
network-based solutions combined with device centric solutions are recommended for next
steps in these studies.
The ideas presented in Appendix D can be generally categorized into:
1. Device-oriented ideas. This concept is based on the device filtering which alerts to
render by comparing knowledge of its location with the coordinates of the polygon of
the target area. As an example, upon receiving an alert the device uses its location-
based technology, Standalone GPS or Assisted GPS (A-GPS), to compare its physical
location with that of the defined alert area/polygon. If the device determines it is
within the polygon and thus meets the defined criteria, the device renders the alert. If
the device determines it is outside of the defined criteria, it does not render the alert.
The coordinates of the alert area polygon would have to be available to the device.
For example, polygon vertices may be broadcasted on the Cellular Broadcast
Channel, over a Wi-Fi connection, or a Cellular Data connection. The “defined
criteria” for rendering the alert will require standardization for consistency across
mobile devices. Ideas to provide the polygon coordinates require further feasibility
study.
2. Optimizations for device-oriented ideas. The optimizations do not directly enhance
geo-targeting, but could enable and/or simplify the implementation of a device-
oriented idea. These optimizations would provide alert originators with the ability to
deliver more detailed messages (e.g., more displayable characters) and provide the
mobile device with the geographic coordinates necessary for device-oriented ideas,
while staying within the parameters of today’s technology. Such optimizations could
include methods to minimize the size of the coordinate data (e.g., through
compression of the Geographic Coordinates Data), smoothing of Polygon,
Page 40The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Circularization of Polygon, and Embedding of Geographic Data in the WEA Alert
Message. Feasibility study on the optimization ideas is needed.
3. Network-oriented ideas. As mentioned earlier, some CMSPs have already made
several network-side enhancements to improve WEA geo-targeting such as the
implementation of polygon based alerting. Development of an industry best practices
specification for geo-targeting in a cell broadcast environment may aid in wider
adoption and consistent implementation of these enhancements.
4. Ideas involving assistance from a third-party (i.e., a party other than the mobile
device and the cellular network). In this idea, a third-party service may be able to
determine the location of the mobile device and assist the mobile device in
determining if the WEA Alert Message should be rendered.
4.5.3 Summary of Findings
Methods to enhance geographic targeting for WEA Alert Messages using 4G LTE cell
broadcast technology have been explored. Based on the START research, these
enhancements will assist in personalizing the threat of the message and improve the public’s
response to alerts. While there are feasibility studies required to work out the details,
enhanced network-based solutions combined with device centric solutions are recommended
for next steps in these studies.
4.6 Topics for Further Study
This section provides the following list of the topics for further study which have been
mentioned or referenced in other sections of this report:
1. Technical confirmation by the ATIS of the 280 displayable character message length
for the enhanced WEA Alert Message is needed.
2. A study is needed for the determination of a methodology for choosing transmission
sites, based upon existing cell broadcast capabilities, to minimize the overshoot and
undershoot of WEA Alert Messages associated with an alert area. The results of this
determination will be used for the development of a Joint ATIS/TIA WEA Cell
Broadcast Geo-Targeting Best Practices specification. (See Recommendation 3.2 in
Section 4.7).
3. A WEA Cell Broadcast Geo-targeting feasibility study is needed to investigate
technology enhancements, including mobile-assisted geo-targeting, for enhancing the
delivery of alert messages to a given geocode, circle, or polygon. (See
Recommendation 3.6 in Section 4.7).
4. An investigation of the needs of individuals with disabilities for enhanced WEA
capabilities and WEA Alert Message content is needed. Such an investigation must
include the advocates and organizations which represent the community of
individuals with disabilities. (See Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2).
5. Studies and research to develop responses to the wireless industry questions on DHS
research activities as provided in Section 4.2.2 is needed.
Page 41The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
6. As stated in Section 4.3, “varying degrees of further research” is needed for Options
C.1 through C.7 of Appendix C.
7. As stated in alternative #1 in Section 4.4.2:
“A study would be needed to determine if directing the subscriber to an
authoritative source (e.g., “Visit FEMA.gov for more information”) or providing
a clickable link to lightweight alert information from an authoritative source
would decrease or increase congestion compared to the subscriber milling about
the web for additional information when no link is provided. The research should
also shed light on technical options for mitigating potential network congestion
associated with a clickable link.”
8. As stated in alternative #2 in Section 4.4.2:
“Wireless industry members request that additional social study be conducted to
understand any potential consequences of showing a map to the user, as well as
identifying how to tie in the alert text into the map. For example, what does the
map indicate and how does it tie into the desired action such as shelter in
place/evacuate/etc. Will the map help the user decide what to do, or could it cause
further confusion?”
9. As stated in the footnote to alternative #2 in Section 4.4.2:
“A Participating CMSP feasibility study would be needed to investigate the ability
to access enhanced WEA data from a URL without a data services plan.”
10. As stated in Recommendation 5.1 of Section 4.7, the development of a Joint
ATIS/TIA feasibility study on the standardization/implementation considerations for
enhancing a text WEA Alert Message with the following additional information and
capabilities is needed:
a. Display on the device a simple map which shows the threat area and
recipient’s location in relation to the alert area for imminent threat alerts.
b. Display on the device a photo such as that of a suspect, missing child, or
abductor for Amber Alerts.
c. Display on the mobile device Hazard symbols (to be defined) associated with
a type of event.
d. Suppression of duplicate alerts when received from multiple sources.
e. Broadcast of the geocodes (i.e., SAME/FIPS, polygon, or circle coordinates).
f. Investigate the usage of built-in geo-location and mapping technologies on the
mobile handset, taking into account CMSP infrastructure impacts of location
determination.
g. An embedded Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and the impacts to the CMSP
network if a large number of users simultaneously access the URL through the
cellular data network.
Page 42The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
h. Any new long-term technologies, such as enhanced Multimedia Broadcast
Multicast Service (eMBMS) for LTE.
i. Usage of alternate data networks (e.g., WiFi, Satellite) when they are
available/accessible.
j. Study requirements, use cases, effects, and potential mitigation solutions for
making WEA data on the mobile device accessible by trusted developer
partners, and address concerns of security, consistency of WEA Alert
Messages across CMSPs, devices, and networks as well as CMSP
responsibility and support for third party WEA applications.
11. Additional research and feasibility studies are needed for the various geo-targeting
concepts presented in Appendix D.
12. Additional research and feasibility studies are needed for the future mobile alert
concept in Appendix F. Note: this concept includes use of satellite capabilities and,
thus, satellite service providers must be included in these additional research and
feasibility study activities.
4.7 Subgroup Recommendations
Note: All references to 280 displayable characters in the Recommendations for Message
Length are subject to technology confirmation by ATIS standards. Further research is needed
in standards to confirm other technical assumptions in this report.
Technology Neutral and Standards Recommendations
Recommendation 1.1: It is recommended that the Commission remain technology neutral in
all rules pertaining to WEA, allowing industry standards to develop and standardize
technology for supporting a Participating CMS Provider’s WEA obligations.
Recommendation 1.2: It is recommended that prior to the adoption of rules affecting 47
CFR Part 10, the Commission will require any technical standards, protocols, procedures,
and related requirements that are adopted be standardized in recognized accredited industry
bodies that have well defined Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policies. Further, consistent
with the CMSAAC recommendations, if and insofar as one or more licenses may be required
under any of their respective IPR that are technically essential for purposes of implementing
or deploying WEA, the rights holders shall license such IPR on a fair, reasonable and
nondiscriminatory basis for those limited purposes only.
Recommendation 1.3: It is recommended the Commission recognize that rules are based on
current technology capabilities and a joint government-industry partnership should
periodically review the capabilities of the technology and recommend further enhancements.
The review should occur every three years via the CSRIC structure or in response to major
advancements in technology which could improve public safety. Discussion of such
technology advancements may occur at the regular WEA partner meetings hosted by the
FCC.
Page 43The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Message Length Recommendations
Recommendation 2.1: It is recommended, following technology confirmation by ATIS
standards, that 47 CFR § 10.430 Character Limit be modified to such that a WEA Alert
Message processed by a Participating CMS Provider has a maximum length of 280
displayable characters of displayable text on capable 4G LTE based CMS Provider
Infrastructure and devices. The existing 90 Character Limit rule will remain for 2G, 3G and
legacy 4G networks and devices based on the limitations of these networks and the
expectation that the overwhelming majority of CMSP infrastructure and mobile devices will
churn23 to capable 4G LTE.
Recommendation 2.2: It is recommended that the industry modify existing CMAS/WEA
standards to support coexistence of both the legacy 90 characters of displayable text for use
on 2nd and 3rd Generation CMS Provider Infrastructure, and a message length of 280
displayable characters for 4G LTE CMS Provider Infrastructure including the addressing of
backward compatibility issues. These standards should support the capability on both the “C”
interface and within the CMS Provider infrastructure. It is recommended the standards
modifications be complete within one year after the issuance of the FCC Report & Order.
Recommendation 2.3: It is recommended that Participating CMS Provider LTE
infrastructure and the FEMA IPAWS Federal Alert Gateway support 280 displayable
characters within two years after the completion of the above mentioned industry standards.
Recommendation 2.4: It is recommended that the OASIS CAP v1.2 IPAWS USA Profile
V1.0 be modified to support 280 displayable characters limit on message length for enhanced
WEA. It is recommended the standards modifications be complete within one year after the
issuance of the FCC Report & Order.
Geo-Targeting Recommendations
Recommendation 3.1: It is recommended that 47 CFR 10 § 10.450 Geographic Targeting be
modified to state that a Participating CMS Provider may voluntarily transmit any Alert
Message that is specified by the Alert Originator using a geocode, circle, or polygon, to an
area that best approximates the geocode, circle, or polygon given the constraints of CMS
Provider infrastructure topology, propagation area, and other radio and network
characteristics. Further, the rules must allow flexibility as Geo-targeting will not be
consistent across any operator’s network, or across different operators, due to design
characteristics and constraints described in this report. If, however, the propagation area of a
CMS provider’s transmission site exceeds the geocode, circle, or polygon, the FCC rules
must allow for a Participating CMS Provider to transmit an Alert Message to an area not
exceeding the propagation area of the CMSP transmission site.
Note: The best approximation of the coverage of the alert area should include as
much of the alert area as technically feasible.
23 In the context of this Recommendation, the term “churn” refers to the wireless subscribers replacing their
older technology mobile devices with new technology mobile devices.
Page 44The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Recommendation 3.2: It is recommended that industry, FEMA, and Alert Originators
collaborate on the development of a WEA Cell Broadcast Geo-targeting Best Practices Joint
ATIS-TIA industry standard describing a methodology for choosing transmission sites in
relation to a given geocode, circle, or polygon for transmitting Alert Messages. The WEA
Cell Broadcast Geo-targeting Best Practices should leverage the results of research, including
the DHS Studies on Geo-targeting which are currently underway.
Note: This WEA Cell Broadcast Geo-targeting Best Practices should include the
evaluation of simple versus complex polygons, number of maximum points in
polygon, polygons with crossing lines within the polygon, responsibility for
validation of polygons, multiple polygons, multiple circles, and combinations of
polygons and circles.
Recommendation 3.3: It is recommended that the WEA Cell Broadcast Geo-targeting Best
Practices standard in Recommendation 3.2 be completed within one year after the issuance of
the FCC Report & Order, and Participating CMS Providers implement the network based
WEA Cell Broadcast Geo-targeting Best Practices standard be completed within two years
after the issuance of the FCC Report & Order.
Recommendation 3.4: It is recommended that any Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) issues,
which may preclude mobile device geo-filtering of WEA Alert Messages, be addressed by
the FCC to allow for enhanced geographic targeting of WEA to the extent that the FCC has
any jurisdiction in IPR issues.
Recommendation 3.5: With the major carriers currently supporting Geo-targeting at a sub-
county level, it is recommended that Alert Originators be encouraged to provide a polygon or
circle when targeting a sub-county area describing the alert area for all WEA Alerts, when
operational considerations allow.
Note: This encouragement should be included in the FEMA provided training on
WEA and IPAWS.
Recommendation 3.6: It is recommended that industry, FEMA, and Alert Originators
collaborate on an ATIS/TIA feasibility study of WEA Cell Broadcast Geo-targeting. The
feasibility study will investigate technology enhancements, including mobile-assisted geo-
targeting, for enhancing the delivery of alert messages to a given geocode, circle, or polygon.
The WEA Cell Broadcast Geo-targeting feasibility study should leverage the results of
research, including the DHS Studies on Geo-targeting which are currently underway. The
results of the ATIS/TIA feasibility study will be reported at the regular WEA partner
meetings hosted by the FCC-CTIA-DHS-FEMA-NWS-CMSPs.
Note: This WEA Cell Broadcast Geo-targeting feasibility study should include the
evaluation of simple versus complex polygons, number of maximum points in
polygon, polygons with crossing lines within the polygon, responsibility for
validation of polygons, multiple polygons, multiple circles, and combinations of
polygons and circles.
Page 45The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Recommendation 3.7: It is recommended that the WEA Cell Broadcast Geo-targeting
feasibility study in Recommendation 3.6 be completed within one year after this
recommendation is adopted by the full CSRIC in order to be available for input into the FCC
rule making process.
Message Content Recommendations
Recommendation 4.1: It is recommended that further social science studies be conducted to
maximize public safety outcomes associated with provision of an image which shows the
threat area and recipient’s location as well as use of other images such as suspect,
abductor/abductee, hazard symbols, etc. It is recommended the studies also compare recipient
actions (i.e., “click through” rates where applicable and overall response to WEA) associated
with direct provision of an image (e.g., image displayed with WEA Alert Message) versus
indirect provision (e.g., recipient must click link or go to secondary application in order to
view the image).
Recommendation 4.2: It is recommended FEMA provide training to Alert Originators on
incorporating a local and recognizable source in the WEA Alert Message.
Recommendation 4.3: It is recommended FEMA provide training to Alert Originators on
using the clearest possible language in WEA Alert Messages given message length
constraints.
Recommendation 4.4: It is recommended FEMA provide training to Alert Originators on
using language in the WEA Alert Message that best conveys who is at risk given message
length constraints.
Recommendation 4.5: It is recommended that FEMA provide training to Alert Originators
on any new capabilities which may be deployed as a result of FCC rulemaking following
feasibility studies.
Recommendation 4.6: It is further recommended that 47 CFR 10 § 10.440 Embedded
Reference Prohibition does not apply for the inclusion of an embedded telephone number for
AMBER Alerts.
Recommendation 4.7: It is recommended that the FCC modify the WEA Alert Message
Requirements § 10.400 Classification to allow the use of WEA for Emergency Government
Information. An Emergency Government Information alert is a message issued by an
authorized Federal, State, Tribal, or local government official source to provide essential
information directly related to an issued weather or non-weather Imminent Threat Alert.
Emergency Government Information is not an alert in itself; it authorizes appropriate
agencies the authority to use WEA to provide essential information related to an imminent
threat. An Emergency Government Information message should only be used to provide
information to assist citizens regarding actions to take resulting from an imminent threat to
life and property; information examples are a boil water order, shelter locations, or an
extended utility outage notification. The Emergency Government Information should allow
for a subscriber opt-out capability (per the WARN Act); this opt-out setting does not imply a
new setting, but may be combined with existing settings on the device, to be defined and
Page 46The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
specified in the Joint ATIS/TIA mobile Device Behavior Specification.
Note: The event codes available for use by Emergency Government Information are
defined in Appendix C of the National Weather Service Non-Weather Related
Emergency Products Specification.24
Supplemental Text Feasibility Study Recommendations
Recommendation 5.1: It is recommended that ATIS/TIA perform a study to identify the
feasibility and standardization/implementation considerations for supplementing a text WEA
Alert Message with additional information requested by Alert Originators in order to
maximize public safety outcomes associated with WEA:
 Display on the device a simple map which shows the threat area and recipient’s
location in relation to the alert area for imminent threat alerts.
 Display on the device a photo such as that of a suspect, missing child, or abductor for
Amber Alerts.
 Display on the mobile device Hazard symbols (to be defined) associated with a type
of event.
 Providing a method to associate a received WEA Alert Message on the mobile device
with the original alert. The use cases for such a method would need to be defined as
part of the study, but may include suppressing duplicate alerts (with the goal of not
over-alerting) if received from multiple sources including those outside CMSP
control, allowing the device/applications to obtain further information from FEMA on
the alert, and for the user to seek additional information.
The feasibility study should investigate CMSP infrastructure and mobile device capabilities
to identify possible ways to achieve the above capabilities with minimal impacts to CMSP in
light of their voluntary election to participate in WEA. Current cell broadcast technology,
which is the standardized WEA method used by the major wireless operators, practically
cannot support sending multimedia as part of a WEA without significant impacts to CMSP
infrastructure. Thus, it is recommended the study consider (but not be limited to):
 A broadcast of the geocodes (i.e., SAME/FIPS, polygon, or circle coordinates) to the
device, which most accurately depict the actual alert area, for geographic display of
the device’s location in relation to the actual alert area, and to determine if the device
should display the alert given the location of the device relevant to the actual alert
area.
o This geocode broadcast should also investigate the usage of built-in geo-
location and mapping technologies on the mobile handset, taking into account
CMSP infrastructure impacts of location determination.
 An embedded Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and the impacts to the CMSP

Report October 2014
network if a large number of users simultaneously access the URL through the
cellular data network, including recommendations on a “lightweight” content/size.
 Any new long-term technologies, such as enhanced Multimedia Broadcast Multicast
Service (eMBMS) for LTE.
 Usage of alternate data networks (e.g., WiFi, Satellite) when they are
available/accessible.
 Study requirements, use cases, effects, and potential mitigation solutions for making
WEA data on the mobile device accessible by trusted developer partners, and address
concerns of security, consistency of WEA Alert Messages across CMSPs, devices,
and networks as well as CMSP responsibility and support for third party WEA
applications.
The ATIS/TIA feasibility study should include practicality with respect to existing and
expected capabilities of CMSP infrastructure, potential IPR issues, evaluation of impacts, and
identification of potential solutions that do not unacceptably impact CMSP networks,
determination of best possible methodology, standardization timeline, and implementation
timelines. In consultation with the Department of Homeland Security Science and
Technology Directorate, the study should leverage any relevant social science and mobile
alerting related studies.
Recommendation 5.2: It is recommended that the ATIS/TIA feasibility study in
Recommendation 5.1 be completed within one year after this recommendation is adopted by
the full CSRIC in order to be available for input into the FCC rule making process. The
results of the ATIS/TIA feasibility study will be reported at the regular WEA partner
meetings hosted by the FCC-CTIA-DHS-FEMA-NWS-CMSPs.
Funding Recommendations
Recommendation 6.1: It is recommended that the FCC identify and establish a method for
funding the design, development and deployment of enhancements to WEA recommended in
this report and adopted by the Commission through an appropriate rulemaking process.
From the Wireless Industry perspective, Participating CMSPs elected to participate in WEA
under the rules developed as a result of the WARN Act and recommendations made to the
FCC through the CMSAAC. The WARN Act did not explicitly lay out a continuous series of
WEA redesign as part of a Participating CMSPs election. Any proposed enhancements are
viewed by the wireless industry as beyond the service envisioned by Congress in enacting the
WARN Act, and exceed current CMSP obligations under the Act. Thus, the recommended
method for funding the design, development and deployment of enhancements to WEA
should apply to Participating CMSPs as well as other stakeholders.
CMS Provider Election & Timeline Recommendations
Recommendation 7.1: It is recommended that the FCC modify the WEA Participation
Election Procedures (§ 10.210) to provide an option for Participating CMS Providers to
reconfirm their election to support WEA including a process to amend the election to support
any modifications or enhancements to WEA rules as adopted by the Commission through an
Page 48The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
appropriate rulemaking process. The modified CMS Provider Election Procedures should
require a CMS provider to electronically file with the Commission, within 180 days
following adoption of changes or enhancements to WEA rules, a letter attesting that the
Provider either:
A. Elects to maintain the CMS Provider decision not to participate in WEA or withdraws
its election to no longer continue to participate in WEA (subject to § 10.220,
Withdrawal of Election to Participate in WEA); or
B. Elects to continue participation based on the CMS Provider’s original election to
participate under the rules in place at the time of the original election; or
C. Elects to participate in whole or in part with the modified or enhanced WEA rules
and:
1. Agrees to transmit such alerts in a manner consistent with the enhanced WEA
technical standards, protocols, procedures, and other technical requirements
for enhanced WEA implemented by the Commission and standardized in an
appropriate industry standards body;
2. Commits to support the development and deployment of technology for the
enhancements to the “C” interface, the CMS provider Gateway, the CMS
provider infrastructure, and mobile devices with enhanced WEA functionality;
3. Supports the CMS provider selected technology to meet obligations under (1)
and (2).
Discussion: The initial deployment of WEA required significant unfunded investment
by CMSPs. There is concern that some CMSPs, especially smaller/rural carriers
which elected to participate in WEA under the existing rules, did not anticipate
continuous changes to WEA and thus may not be able to support another unfunded
investment to upgrade to support any enhancement. If the expectation is to upgrade
the network infrastructure to support enhancements to WEA, some operators may
choose to withdraw their election to participate in WEA because their business
models cannot support such infrastructure upgrades. Option “B” is to provide those
operators which are currently participating in WEA the ability to continue to
participate with their current investments in infrastructure under the existing rules.
The intent is to avoid the scenario where a CMSP withdraws from WEA because their
business model will not support the enhancements, so rather than withdrawing their
election, this allows them to continue to participate with the current WEA so their
subscribers at least get the WEA capabilities they have today.
Recommendation 7.2: It is recommended that within 180 days of the FCC adoption of rules
for WEA enhancements, the FCC, Participating CMS providers, FEMA, and Alert
Originators jointly identify the timelines for enhanced WEA development, testing and
deployment, including the FEMA timeline for support of enhanced WEA in the Federal Alert
Aggregator and Alert Gateway. The timeline should also take into consideration completion
of industry feasibility studies and establishment of industry standards development timelines.
4.8 Impact to Standards
In order to support the recommendation for 280 displayable characters of displayable text in
LTE, a number of existing standards may need to be modified in both North American and
Global standards. These standards include but not limited to:

identified by ATIS/TIA during the feasibility study.
5 Conclusions
WEA is recognized as an important public safety tool. It is one of the many tools that make
up this nation’s larger warning system. Enhancements to increase the effectiveness of WEA
and overall public safety are recognized by all stakeholders. The working group’s effort
focused on recommending enhancements to WEA which are based on needs expressed by
alert origination members of the working group and are technically feasible as a voluntary
service by Participating CMS Providers.
Participating CMSPs expressed that any enhancements be technologically neutral without
harming commercial wireless networks and service to their subscribers. Members of the alert
origination community desire improvements which would personalize the threat and improve
public response to WEA Alert Messages based on outcomes from social science studies and
long known tenets of public alerting.
Based on input from all stakeholders, there was consensus among the group to submit the
recommendations in Section 4.7 for consideration by the FCC and industry. Obtaining
consensus on supplementing the WEA with graphical information and enhancements to
geographical targeting was more challenging. Thus, an ATIS/TIA feasibility study is
recommended. The study would consider several alternatives, potential impacts to CMSP
networks, and be completed in time to be available as input to the FCC rule making process.

Appendix A: Existing WEA Standards
CMAS implementation in the United States has been based on industry standards. ATIS,
TIA, and Joint ATIS/TIA standards for CMAS were developed based on cell broadcast and
Public Warning System (PWS) specifications in 3GPP and 3GPP2. The following table is a
listing of the major CMAS-related standards (as well as some related FCC docs and the
WARN Act) used to support implementation of Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) in the
United States.

Appendix B: Findings and Recommendations from the DHS Studies on
Mobile Alerting
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is committed to using cutting-edge
technologies and scientific talent in its quest to make America safer. The Department of
Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) is tasked with
researching and organizing the scientific, engineering, and technological resources of the
United States and leveraging these existing resources into technological tools to help protect
the homeland.
DHS S&T established the Commercial Mobile Alert Service (CMAS) [now referred to as
Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA)] research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&E)
program to develop a collaborative, information technology laboratory capability that
facilitates systems research, technology development, and testing and evaluation related to
public alerts and warnings. The WEA RDT&E program faces the organizational challenge
of aligning the efforts of a diverse research community in the public and private sectors to
specific legislative mandates and national goals.
The RDT&E program is enabling and enhancing a national capability to deliver
geographically-targeted alert messages to mobile devices and pagers that elicit the intended
public response. Per the Warning, Alert, and Response Network (WARN) Act, DHS S&T
will partner with academic institutions, the private sector, government laboratories, and other
entities to perform RDT&E activities that address geo-targeting and public response
capability gaps.
DHS S&T has established the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism (the START
Center) at the College of Behavioral and Social Science, University of Maryland at College
Park as a Center of Excellence (COE). As outlined in START’s statement of work (SOW),
the START Center will conduct a public response-related project entitled, “Comprehensive
Testing of Imminent Threat Public Messages for Mobile Devices.”
A preliminary report of START’s research findings were delivered to the DHS Science and
Technology Directorate in January 2014.
The authors of that document are Hamilton Bean, Assistant Professor at the University of
Colorado, Denver; Michele Wood, Assistant Professor at California State University,
Fullerton; Dennis Mileti, Professor Emeritus at University of Colorado, Boulder; Brooke Liu,
Associate Professor at University of Maryland, College Park; Jeannette Sutton, Senior
Research Associate at Trauma Health and Hazards Center at the University of Colorado,
Colorado Springs; and Stephanie Madden, Doctoral Fellow at the University of Maryland,
College Park. Questions about this document should be directed to Dr. Bean at

This research was supported by the Science and Technology Directorate of the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security through Contract Award Number HSHQDC-10-A-
BOA36/HSHQDC-12-J-00145 made to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism
and Responses to Terrorism (START). The views and conclusions contained in this
document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing

Report October 2014
the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security, or START, wireless vendors, wireless network operators, or wireless service
providers.
Below are primary conclusions extracted from the Report’s Executive Summary and
represent the research performed to date are:
1. Short alert and warning messages (90- and 140-characters) are unique and unlike any
others: The optimized order of their contents is unique; their limited length constrains
public understanding of the message source; people are less able to understand if the
message is meant for them; the key content elements of guidance (describing what to
do and how to do it) and hazard (describing why they should do it) cannot be
adequately communicated; and short messages cannot overcome people’s pre-event
hazard-specific perceptions. Hence, to be effective at motivating public protective
action taking, the short messages in use today rely on information provided by others.
2. There are pathways forward to optimize today’s wireless emergency alert messages:
An alternative order of message contents could be put into practice; message sources
of a particular kind could be selected; and a public education and marketing campaign
about the WEA system could be conducted.
3. The project’s findings provide concrete insights to help imagine optimized wireless
emergency alert and warning messages that could exist in the future. These messages
would not rely on information provided by others, but would instead be sufficient to
motivate public protective action taking on their own. In addition to putting into
practice an alternative order of message contents, selecting message sources of a
particular kind, and conducting a public education and marketing campaign about the
WEA system, the optimized messages of the future could also include high
information maps, and allow for up to 1,380-characters message in length.
Key findings from the research reported here suggest that:
4. Order of Message Contents. A different order for the content contained in 90-
characters WEA messages may improve public response outcomes. WEA
messages currently use the following order: hazard, location, time, guidance, and
source. An alternative order had an advantage in improving the public outcomes
tested. It was: source, guidance, hazard, location, and time. Although this alternative
order only had a statistically weak advantage over the current WEA message content
order, if put into practice, the effect of the revised order could be substantial
considering how many more people in a population at risk might be inclined to take
action in response to the revised order. The qualitative research provided support this
optimized message order for 140-characters messages; however, it does not appear to
transfer to 1,380-characters messages for which the optimized order seems to be
source, hazard, guidance, location, and time.
5. Message Source. Source in 90-characters messages had a statistically significant
effect on some sense making public response outcomes including interpretation
(understanding, believing, and deciding) and personalization, and, hence, likely
on protective action-taking. Quantitative and qualitative findings also suggest that
local and recognizable sources might be the most productive sole source to name in a
Page 56The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
WEA message, but further research is needed to confirm these unstable conclusions.
Findings here, however, do more conclusively suggest that if a sole source named in a
WEA message is not recognizable to the public (e.g., WEA), then a vigorous public
education and marketing campaign would be worthwhile. Quantitative findings also
suggest that there may not be a single sole source that works for all WEA messages.
The same conclusions were reached based on qualitative investigations of 140- and
1,380-characters messages.
6. Map Inclusion. High information map inclusion (specifying the areas affected and
not affected and the receiver’s location) in 90-characters messages had a
statistically significant and positive effect on public response outcomes including
interpretation and personalization, and, hence, could have a positive effect on
protective action-taking. Inclusion of a low information map (specifying the areas
affected and not affected, but not the receiver’s location) had the opposite effect. The
results of the qualitative research indicated that inclusion of a high information map
improved most participants’ understanding, belief, and risk personalization across all
message lengths. These findings suggest that there certainly would be a benefit from
adding a high-information map to a WEA message. Doing so could help the public
interpret and personalize the worded message, which could, in turn, move more
people at risk to take protective action.
7. Relative Importance of Contents Elements. Guidance and hazard message content
elements played key roles compared to other message content elements (location,
time, and source) in facilitating the sense making outcomes of interpretation
(understanding, believing, and deciding) and personalization. They also reduced
milling (causing delay in taking a protective action). Hence, they have a positive
effect on public alert and warning responses. The additional quantitative and
qualitative findings affirm and provide a possible explanation for these findings:
Perhaps placing guidance and hazard up front in a 90-characters WEA message
optimized outcomes because they are the most important content elements. These
findings suggest that the core content of a public alert and warning: Tell people
exactly what to do (guidance) and describe why they should do it (hazard). Those
who prepare future public alert and warning messages might consider emphasizing
these content topics, but not to the exclusion of the others.
8. Generalizing Across Hazard Types. Short 90- and 140-characters messages were
substantially less effective than 1,380-characters messages at helping people
overcome their pre-conceived perceptions about different hazards and likely
would be less effective at guiding people to take protective actions appropriate to
the risk they face in an actual event. In this study, the content elements of 1,380-
characters messages delivered over mobile communication devices have standardized
effects on outcomes regardless of hazard type (generalize across hazards). However,
90- and 140- characters messages did not. Shorter messages do not appear to contain
sufficient information to help people overcome their pre-conceptions about different
hazards based on their personal experience, perceived risk, and knowledge, which
likely will not match the event they face. Hence, short messages appear to offer
substantially less to effectively manage public alert and warning response than longer
messages.
9. Message Length Efficacy. The scientific evidence assembled led to the conclusion
Page 57The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
that messages that are 1,380-characters appear to produce optimized
interpretation, personalization and milling outcomes, and would likely yield
maximized public protective action-taking behavior. Shorter messages that are 90-
and 140-chracters appear less effective at guiding people toward protective action
taking. There is nothing inherently better about 1,380-characters messages. What is
likely the case is that people need to be provided with sufficiently detailed
information about exactly what steps to take to protect themselves, and the number of
characters needed to accomplish this likely varies across hazards. Participant and
professional emergency manager opinions, however, led to the conclusion that
140-charactres messages were the most desirable. This reveals what may be an
American alert and warning dilemma: Should alert and warning message
lengths be based on knowledge gained by application of the scientific method, or
on beliefs and opinion?
10. Inclusion of a URL. Consideration should be given to including a URL in wireless
emergency alert and warning messages of any message length. Doing so would be
consistent with the long-standing historical observation that people who are warned
engage in a search for additional information before taking a protective action. It
remains unclear, however, if inclusion of a URL in alerts and warnings might reduce
or increase the delay in taking a protective action after message receipt.
11. Familiarity with the WEA System. There is a lack of public familiarity with the
WEA system. One might hypothesize that this lack of familiarity would play a role in
the effectiveness of the system when in use. If it is determined that prior
familiarity with the WEA system improves public response, then a campaign to
educate the public about the WEA system would be appropriate.
12. Understanding of Acronyms. The public may have little or no understanding of
the acronyms used in WEA messages. Hence, consideration should be given to
modifying the system to discontinue the use of acronyms, educate the public
about their meaning, or increase the message length to allow for full text
descriptions rather than acronyms. There may be unique exceptions. For example,
it is likely that in tornado alley, members of the public are well aware than NWS
represents the National Weather Service.
13. How to Best Express Time. The way WEA messages express time may confuse the
public. Currently, WEA messages express time by stating when the message expires
so that such messages do not persist in perpetuity. This serves an important function,
but also confuses the public and may delay protective action taking. If time is
expressed in WEA messages with language about the time a message expires,
consideration also should be given to communicating the time a message
“begins” (without increasing message length) to reduce public confusion. For
example, if the words “now” or “immediately” are used, would capitalizing all
the letters in those words help to communicate that the message is already in
effect when people receive it?
14. How to Best Express Location. Given the 90-character limit of current WEA
messages, the phrase “in this area” does not effectively work to communicate
who is and who is not located within the risk area. Each WEA disseminated
message that states “in this area” but does not apply to the individual receiving the
Page 58The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
message may train message receivers that the phrase “in this area” may not apply to
them. The effectiveness of current WEA messages may remain suppressed until
they can be distributed to finer geospatial targeted populations so that messages
only reach the people who are at risk. We do not yet know how to best
communicate in a WEA message who is and who is not at risk, for example, by
including impact area maps, finer grained distribution, or the use of longer text
messages that allow description of the risk area.
15. Optimum Level of Fear Arousal. Alert and warning messages elicit a wide range of
varied emotional responses. However, the impact fear and other emotions on public
alert and warning response could not yet be clarified based on the experimental and
focus group methods used to date. The precise roles emotions may play in making
sense of and responding to public alert and warning messages remains unknown,
but it will be investigated in the project’s research where the emotion to
response relationship can be assessed. If a relationship between emotional response
and alert and warning message response is established, then the role of message
attributes on emotional outcomes should be examined and taken into account.
16. Understanding of Alert and Warning Concepts. The public may not understand
basic alert and warning concepts. Messages should not rely on the assumption
that the public understands terms such as shelter and evacuate. Alert and warning
messages that are short and contain concepts such as shelter and evacuate may mean
different things to different people who receive the message. For example, the
standard evacuate to higher ground tsunami message may mean twenty feet above
sea level to some, and one hundred feet above sea level to others. Short 90- and 140-
characters messages are, therefore, not likely to maximize public health and safety in
rapid onset events such as a poison gas release in a subway, a locally generated
tsunami, and more. For messages that are longer than 90- and 140-characters,
basic alert and warning concepts should be described to the extent possible.
Short 90- and 140-characters messages may work fine for events whose impact is not
imminent.
17. Visualization. Visual stimuli including bullets, bolding, iconography (source
logo/seal, for example), indentation, font size, color, or italics, etc. might influence
WEA message interpretation and subsequent message response. Additionally, so
might the character of audible tones that indicate the arrival of a message. Sound,
color, size, shape, and style could all potentially influence WEA message
interpretation and subsequent response but it is not yet know how.

Appendix C: Alternatives for WEA Alert Message Length Options
This Appendix describes the following WEA Alert Message length options considered by the
subworking group:
 WEA Alert Message Length Option 1 – Increase Length Using Existing Underlying
CMSP Infrastructure
 WEA Alert Message Length Option 2 – Packet-Based Concatenation
 WEA Alert Message Length Option 3 – Message-Based Concatenation
 WEA Alert Message Length Option 4 – Human-Based Concatenation
 WEA Alert Message Length Option 5 – Fewer Bits per Character
 WEA Alert Message Length Option 6 – Downloading Over Cellular Connection
 WEA Alert Message Length Option 7 – Downloading Over WiFi Connection
All specific LTE‐supported maximum message lengths and LTE page/segment size numbers
mentioned in this document are subject to review/modification by national and international
standards bodies. The potential WEA Alert Message lengths to be supported by LTE
throughout this document are examples, and the actual numbers will depend on operator
implementation decisions.

C.1. WEA Alert Message Length Option 1 – Increase Length Using Existing
Underlying CMSP Infrastructure Capabilities
Even though GSM, UMTS & LTE can transmit more than 90 displayable characters in a cell
broadcast message, and some CDMA systems can transmit more than 90 displayable
characters in a cell broadcast message, this option proposes to increase the maximum length
of a WEA Alert Message for LTE beyond the current FCC 90 displayable character rule.
Table 5: Considerations for WEA Alert Message Length Option 1
Maximum Length  GSM/UMTS: 93 per page
 LTE: approximately 280 displayable characters subject to
technology confirmation by ATIS standards
 CDMA 4800bps: Variable, but 90 guaranteed
 CDMA 9600bps: Variable, but 90 guaranteed

Alert Originator In order to accommodate existing base of 2G/3G and LTE
WEA-enabled mobile devices, as well as future LTE mobile
devices capable of receiving longer messages, the Alert
Originator would need to create two WEA Alert Messages,
the first adhering to the 90 displayable character maximum
and the second to support the longer displayable character
length.
Alternatively, a longer displayable character message may be
created where the first 90 displayable characters remain per
the current FCC rules and are delivered to legacy devices,
EOC and the full longer displayable characters are delivered to
future enhanced WEA LTE mobile devices.
Alert Alert Origination Tool would need to create both the 90
Origination Tool displayable character WEA Alert Message and the longer
displayable character WEA Alert Message in order to support
both legacy mobile devices and future enhanced WEA
capable LTE mobile devices.

C.2. WEA Alert Message Length Option 2 – Packet-Based Concatenation
GSM/UMTS standards support the concatenation up to fifteen pages resulting in a maximum
of 1,381 characters. The LTE standards have the theoretical ability to concatenate 32 pages
resulting in a maximum of about 10,000 characters. CDMA Cell Broadcast standards do not
support concatenation. This concatenation option poses significant network engineering and
operational challenges; thus making this option impractical.
In order to maintain consistency across all 2G/3G technologies, the existing 90 displayable
character length should be maintained for the legacy technologies. LTE supports longer
message lengths per page.

Pros Has the potential to support longer length for WEA Alert

Cons There is no mechanism in existing standards to perform this
sequencing of the longer WEA Alert Message into individual
90 displayable character messages.
This alternative would require a feasibility study and, if
feasible, followed by a standardization effort as well as
development.
This method is not backwards compatible with existing WEA
standards and implementations.
The mobile device may not receive every individual WEA
Alert Message of the sequence of WEA Alert Messages due
to transmission errors, coverage gaps, edge of coverage
boundary, etc.
The mobile device may have difficulty determining the
individual WEA Alert Messages of the sequence and not
conflict with the duplicate message detection functionality.
This method may be problematic at boundaries of technologies
(e.g., UMTS and LTE) when a mobile moves between
technologies and receives only some of the multi-part
message before the transition.
Modifications would be required to the 3GPP standards to
support the longer WEA Alert Messages, the sequencing and
to support inbound international roamers; because the
underlying standards/technology already supports longer
message lengths it is unlikely that this methodology would be
seriously considered in any regional or global standards.
Multi-part messages increase network traffic load.
Broadcast of all message parts may be delayed depending upon
traffic and congestion conditions.
Retransmission frequency is based upon the wireless operator
network traffic load, the number of WEA Alert Messages,
and the number parts for a WEA Alert Message. There may a
significant amount of time between the retransmission of an
individual part of a multi-part WEA Alert Message.
Presentation of reconstructed alert message to the subscriber
may be delayed if one or more components of the message
are not received error-free and a wait for rebroadcast of one
or more messages is required.
Dropped/lost messages would delay presentation of the WEA
Alert Message to the mobile device user.
Even though longer displayable characters can be broadcast,

C.4. WEA Alert Message Length Option 4 – Human-Based Concatenation
The original alert message is partitioned into multiple smaller (90 displayable character
maximum) alert messages before delivery to the CMSP, adding page numbers to each of the
smaller alert messages [e.g., (1/3), (2/3), (3/3)]. Therefore, the original alert message is
delivered to the CMSP as multiple individual WEA Alert Messages, and the end-user is
relied upon to read them in the correct order.
A feasibility study would need to be performed to determine a practical mechanism for the
partitioning and management of the WEA Alert Message.

EOC Origination Tool would need modifications to generate
multiple 90 displayable character messages which include the
appropriate (n/m) sequencing.
The Alert Origination Tool must also manage alert updates and
alert cancellations for all messages in the sequence.
Aggregator Assuming the Alert Origination Tool breaks the longer
message into smaller parts, ideally each part of the message
in the sequence would have to be sent to the Aggregator at
approximately the same time so that each message is
delivered to the CMSP Gateway at approximately the same
time.
May need to accommodate CAP messages to support delivery

Individuals with disability especially cognitive disabilities will

Assumes a particular implementation in the mobile device. At
least one smartphone OS does not store the WEA Alert
Messages. Many smartphone implementations only display
one alert message at a time. Therefore, the subscriber would
have to read each message individually and remember the
message content.
Subscriber may not receive the multiple WEA Alert Messages
in numerical order. For example, the first message received
by mobile device may be 2 of 3.
If several multi-part alert messages are being broadcast at the
same time, the subscriber will have difficulty identifying
which parts of which message belong together and thus will
have difficulty understanding the alert messages. For
example, does the 2 of 3 message received apply to the Flash
Flood alert message or the Severe Thunderstorm alert
message?

C.5. WEA Alert Message Length Option 5 – Fewer Bits per Character
Today, the CMSP infrastructure including the radio elements uses an internationally
standardized and recognized 7-bits-per-character encoding scheme (3GPP TS 23.038),
resulting in a maximum of 630 bits in a 90 displayable character FCC defined WEA Alert
Message. It is possible, if defined in global standards, to use alternate character sets that use
fewer bits per character. By reducing the number of bits per character, this option can
increase the number of characters accommodated by 630 bits.
Methods to reduce the number of bits per character require further research as well as further
study and standardization in ATIS and/or 3GPP. Methods to reduce the number of bits per
character may include new encoding schemes, e.g., at the application layer. Typical methods
to reduce the number of bits per character are (a) eliminating unused characters from the
allowable character set, and (b) exploiting statistical characteristics of WEA Alert Messages.
Table 9: Considerations for WEA Alert Message Length Option 5
Maximum Length Further study would be needed to determine the maximum
displayable character length. However, for 2G and 3G
networks, 140 displayable characters seems within reach, but
research, standardization, lab testing, and evaluation would
be needed to investigate the limit more thoroughly and to
describe a bit representation scheme for reaching that limit.
Further study would be needed to identify the maximum
displayable character message in LTE.

C.6. WEA Alert Message Length Option 6 – Downloading Over Cellular
Connection
Upon receiving the existing 90 displayable character WEA Alert Message, the mobile device
can be programmed to treat the cell broadcast reception of a WEA Alert Message as a trigger
to fetch more detailed information from a trusted source using the mobile device's cellular
data connection. The “fetch” could be automatic, or it could be a “clickable” or “non-
clickable” URL embedded in the 90 displayable character WEA Alert Message that the user
would select if more detailed information is desired.
The “detailed information” from the trusted source should be limited in size, for example it
may be a longer text message (e.g., 280-characters). This “retrieval from trusted source” is
outside the scope of carrier obligations under WEA (both FCC rules and the WARN Act).
The “detailed information” is generated by the Alert Originator, is sent to FEMA IPAWS
where the detail information is then sent to the “trusted source” to be available for mobile
devices to retrieve.
The trusted source must have a well-known address that is either pre-provisioned in the
mobile device and not included as part of the WEA Alert Message, or optionally included in
the 90 displayable character WEA broadcast.

Pros
Cons Use of the cellular network for additional data may be
disruptive by overloading the network and may adversely
impacting voice and data services including 9-1-1 emergency
calls and Wireless Priority Service (WPS). ‘Automatic”
retrieval of data may be worse than allowing users to retrieve
on their own. This alternative is susceptible to congestion on
CMSP networks, and depending on how many WEA devices
are attempting to retrieve detailed information from a given
cell site or group of cell sites, the results could be anywhere
from reduced throughput for each user (slowing the retrieval
of the detailed information) to congestion/blockage of voice
and data traffic in the cell(s). The trusted source could also
experience congestion, especially if there are a significant
number of alerts throughout the country at the same time
(e.g., similar effect to the recent Twitter congestion from the
number of retweets of the photo from the Grammy’s).
The trusted server may be overloaded.
The alternative must scale for potential nationwide alerts
covering 300+ million mobile devices.
May exclude providing alert information to classes of users
that either do not use cellular data or cannot afford
smartphones or data services.
There are no mobile device APIs defined for third party apps to
receive the information. Standards would have to be
developed.
There is no information in the WEA text message to correlate it
to the original alert message. There is no room in the
existing 90 displayable character message to add an
indication of the original alert message. The WEA Alert
Message text is not unique enough to correlate to the original
message.
If the indication to the original message is included in the 90
displayable characters, legacy mobile devices will display
this indication which is appear as gibberish to the mobile
device user.
Use of a different message ID to provide the information on the
location of the information on the trusted server would need
development efforts for the CMSP infrastructure.
Support of a different message ID to provide the information
Page 78The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
on the location of the information on the trusted server also
requires mobile device modifications.
This option assumes a particular implementation in the mobile
device. At least one smartphone OS does not store the WEA
Alert Messages in a WEA inbox. Therefore, it will not be
possible for a WEA app to retrieve that alert message on that
smartphone OS.
An entity has to be identified and established to be the “trusted
source”.
The trusted source would need to open their systems to every
mobile device in the world with no security mechanisms.
It can be envisioned that malware or man-in-the-middle attacks
could be used to cause havoc.
Even though a larger number of displayable characters can be
obtained, the form factors of various types and models of
mobile devices to not easily facilitate the presentation of very
large alert messages.
This alternative requires the subscriber to have a data plan and
these sessions will be charged to the subscriber’s data plan.
Alternatively, this could be a subscription based service paid
for by the trusted source.
Challenges with Regard to WARN Act This alternative does not meet the WARN Act requirements.
The Participating CMS provider is not responsible for the
trusted source or retrieval process.
This alternative is beyond the obligations of the CMSPs and
outside of the scope of the WARN Act.
WARN specifically states that WEA alerts are to be provided
at no cost to the subscribers. However, retrieval of additional
information from the trusted source would incur charges to
the subscriber’s data plan.
Mitigating Factors Some users may do this on their own today to seek additional
information. There may be potentially many sources of
information to which they can turn.
There are techniques available to handle potential overloading
of trusted servers. Content staging and load balancing are
examples of potential mitigations for the overloading of
trusted server.
To correlate the message at the trusted server with the WEA
alert, additional information must be provided in the WEA
Alert Message. Additional study would be required to
evaluate the character limitations and capabilities available in
LTE.
Network integrity standards could be developed that would
limit use of this alternative to messages that would not trigger
reactions close to network capability limitations.
Use this alternative only for localized emergency events and
not for large scale WEA alerts or nationwide Presidential
alerts to reduce impact to the trusted server.
The ATIS/TIA standards body would need to evaluate this
alternative and provide any mitigating factors to the impacts
to the cellular networks.
The FCC would need to work with Congress on exemption on
Page 79The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
subscriber charges for retrieval of the additional information
from the trusted source. If an exemption is not available,
mechanisms for handling would be required.
ATIS/TIA would need to perform a feasibility study of not
charging the subscribers for the data retrieval from the trusted
source and charging the trusted source for any associated data
retrievals of the additional information.

C.7. WEA Alert Message Length Option 7 – Downloading Over WiFi
Connection
Upon receiving the existing 90 displayable character WEA Alert Message, the mobile device
can be programmed to treat the cell broadcast reception of a WEA Alert Message as a trigger
to fetch more detailed information from a trusted source using the mobile device's WiFi
connection (if available). The “fetch” could be automatic, or it could be a “clickable” or
“non-clickable” URL embedded in the 90 displayable character WEA Alert Message that the
user would select if more detailed information is desired.
The “detailed information” from the trusted source should be limited in size, for example it
may be a longer text message (e.g., 280-characters). This “retrieval from trusted source” is
outside the scope of carrier obligations under WEA (both FCC rules and the WARN Act).
The “detailed information” is generated by the Alert Originator, is sent to FEMA IPAWS
where it is then sent to the “trusted source” to be available for mobile devices to retrieve.
The trusted source must have a well-known address that is either pre-provisioned in the
mobile device and not included as part of the WEA Alert Message, or optionally included in
the 90 displayable character WEA broadcast.

Appendix D: Evaluation of WEA Geo-Targeting Options
This Appendix discusses ideas for enhancing WEA geo-targeting that were suggested by
members of the subgroup. Suggestions were accepted from members regardless of their
degree of expertise in cellular networks/systems; allowing the inclusion of ideas motivated
by expectations that have been shaped by the public’s experience with present-day mobility
technologies (in particular smartphone-enabled capabilities).
Non-experts in cellular networks/systems may not be aware of certain considerations (e.g.,
inner workings of cellular networks, cost considerations, international standards
considerations, etc.) and limitations. Thus, an analysis which incorporates expertise from
wireless industry members follows the description of each idea. The analyses assess the level
of practicality given current and foreseeable-future cellular network design and
infrastructure. Ideas considered impractical may be revisited as efforts to improve WEA
continue over the coming years and standards to support these impractical ideas evolve.
Furthermore, the inclusion of ideas, that are subsequently deemed impractical, provides a
documented analysis for why some ideas that would otherwise appear obvious to the average
person are not implemented in WEA.
Wireless industry members advise that implementation of any idea needs to be vetted and
standardized in an accredited global standards organization (e.g., such as 3GPP and its North
American Organizational Partner ATIS).
D.1. Enhancements to WEA Geo-Targeting Since Rollout
Since the rollout of WEA, some CMSPs have made several enhancements to WEA geo-
targeting that exceed the requirements specified in FCC’s First Report and Order including:
1. Allowing the specification of target areas (i.e., geographic areas specified by Alert
Originators to receive the alert) using polygons, as opposed to counties.
2. Selecting alert-broadcasting base-stations based on the overlap of their respective
coverage areas with the target area, as opposed to selecting base-stations that are
simply located within the target area.
3. Broadcasting the alert to a subset of sectors within a cell, whereby the coverage areas
of sectors not transmitted to do not overlap with the target area. This enhancement
has only been introduced in LTE networks. As the cellular industry continues its
migration to LTE, this enhancement will apply to an increasing percentage of mobile
devices.
D.2. About Enhancing WEA Geo-Targeting
From the perspective of the Alert Originator, ideal WEA geo-targeting includes:
a) unlimited flexibility and precision in defining the alert area25;
b) rendering of the WEA alert on all mobile devices within the alert area; and
c) no mobile device outside the alert area rendering the WEA alert.
25 See Section 3.3 for definition of alert area.
Page 85The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Accordingly from the perspective of the alert originator, enhanced geo-targeting could be
achieved through:
1) Increasing the granularity of the alert area as specified/defined by the Alert
Originator.
2) Increasing the number of mobile devices within the alert area that render the WEA
alert.
3) Decreasing the number of mobile devices outside the alert area that render the WEA
alert.
It is important to note that in the context of WEA broadcasting, there is typically a trade-off
between 2) and 3) above.
Indeed from the perspective of a CMSP broadcasting WEA alerts, the objective is to attempt
to best approximate the alert area with the CMSP broadcast area as close as possible in order
to optimize the number of mobile devices within the alert area that present the WEA alert.
The ideas presented in this Appendix can be divided into four categories:
1. Device-oriented ideas.
2. Enablers for device-oriented ideas. This category includes ideas that do not directly
enhance geo-targeting, but could enable and/or simplify the implementation of a
device-oriented idea.
3. Network-oriented ideas.
4. Ideas involving assistance from a third-party (i.e., a party other than the mobile
device and the cellular network).
D.3. About Device’s Estimation of Own Location
Several ideas later in this section are based on the device having an estimate of its geographic
location (henceforth geo-location estimate). There is a popular notion that the modern mobile
device has an accurate geo-location estimate at all times– especially in light of numerous
smartphone applications which show the user their location or use the user’s geo-location
information in some other way. This notion is not 100% correct. Location determination for
mobile devices relies on several techniques to achieve that goal including GPS, OTDOA,
WiFi SSID cross-referencing, and inertial sensors.26
The speed with which the mobile device can obtain an updated geo-location estimate varies
from case to case. In addition, the impact to the network as the mobile device obtains its geo-
location estimate varies from case to case.
Focusing on GPS in particular, the mobile device does not always acquire the GPS-based
estimate of its location via a standalone/autonomous GPS (S-GPS) operation that uses radio
signals from satellites alone. In many cases mobile devices rely on Assisted GPS (A-
26 See http://blog.jammer-store.com/2012/04/10-ways-for-your-smartphone-to-discover-where-you-are/. WiFi
SSID is the ID of the WiFi network. There are databases containing the locations of a large number of WiFi
networks. The location of the device can therefore be estimated by looking up the location of a WiFi network
that is adjacent to it.
Page 86The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
GPS).An explanation can be found in 3GPP TS 23.271, titled “Functional stage 2 description
of Location Services (LCS)”27.) A-GPS additionally uses network resources to locate and use
the satellites in poor signal conditions, which may arise due to multipath propagation (e.g.,
bouncing off buildings) and signal weakening (e.g., signal degradation by having to pass
through walls, tree cover, various types of construction, etc.) to speed the calculation of the
device location. If first turned on in these conditions, some standalone GPS navigation
devices may not be able to fix a position due to the fragmentary signal, and a fix may take as
long as 12.5 minutes (the time needed to download the GPS almanac and ephemeris and to
search the sky for GPS signal). This condition is commonly referred to as a “Cold Start”.
Under average conditions, S-GPS can provide first position in approximately 30-40 seconds.
This condition is commonly referred to as a “Warm Start”. If the satellite signals are lost
during the acquisition of this information, it is discarded and the standalone system has to
perform a Cold Start GPS location from scratch. In A-GPS, the CMSP deploys an A-GPS
server. These A-GPS servers download the orbital information from the satellite and store it
in a database. An A-GPS-enabled mobile device can connect to these servers and download
this information using CMSP network radio bearers such as GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, LTE
or even using other wireless radio bearers such as WiFi. Usually the data rate of these bearers
is high; hence downloading orbital information takes less time. It is important to note
however that A-GPS may use data services of the cellular network.
A-GPS has two primary modes of operation:
1. Mobile Station Based (MSB): The mobile device receives GPS signals from the
visible satellites. It also receives GPS data (ephemeris, reference location, reference
time) and other optional assistance data from the A-GPS server. (The CMSP
continuously logs GPS information from the GPS satellites using an A-GPS server in
its system.) Based on the satellite signals and with the help of the above A-GPS data,
the mobile device calculates the position.
2. Mobile Station Assisted (MSA): The mobile device receives acquisition assistance,
reference time and other optional assistance data from the CMSP. Using that data in
conjunction with the GPS signals, the mobile device calculates a ‘fix’ and relays that
‘fix’ to a CMSP A-GPS server. Using the data received from the mobile device and
the data already present in A-GPS server, the A-GPS server calculates the position of
the mobile device and sends the newly calculated position back to the device.
It should be noted that whether a mobile device functions in MSA or MSB mode is
determined by how it is designed by its manufacturer, chipset vendor, and CMSP. There is
no setting on the device which allows the user or an application to select MSA or MSB
mode.
D.4. Device-Oriented Ideas
The ideas presented in this section are based on device-assisted enhancements to geo-
targeting. To geo-filter a received alert this, generally, would entail the mobile device using
a) its knowledge of its location (provided it is immediately available to the device and is
not “stale”), and
27 See http://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/23271.htm.
Page 87The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
b) the coordinates of the polygon of the target area.
For example, if a mobile device is outside the target area but receives the alert from a base-
station whose broadcast signal traveled beyond the boundary of the polygon, then the mobile
device could have a method to determine that it is outside the target alert area, and hence
decide not to render the alert. It is important to note that this idea is not new and was fully
vetted during the proceedings of CMSAAC, but was challenged with Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR) considerations. A licenseholder could not guarantee FRAND terms including
standardization in an accredited SDO with a well-defined IPR policy. That reason was one
factor behind CMSAAC not proposing such a solution for geo-targeting. A full review of the
IPR issues that were discussed in 2007 would need to be revisited in order to implement
ideas related to geo-filtering.
A seemingly necessary condition for device-assisted geo-targeting would be for the device to
acquire the coordinates of the polygon. Several techniques below offer different ideas related
to the acquisition of the coordinates of the polygon’s vertices.
The geo-filtering method described above may continue have IPR protection by one or more
entities. Patents have a limited lifetime and a full patent investigation needs to be conducted
to evaluate if there are any active patents that may have IPR issues related to geo-filtering.
The proposed ideas which were discussed for enabling a mobile device to perform geo-
filtering included:
 Broadcasting Coordinates on Cellular Broadcast Channel
 Downloading Coordinates over WiFi Connection
 Downloading Coordinates over Cellular Data Connection
D.4.1 Broadcasting Coordinates on Cellular Broadcast Channel
Description: Along with broadcasting the text of the WEA Alert Message, the CMSP would
also broadcast the coordinates of the alert area. The coordinates could be broadcast in either a
concatenated segment, or as separate broadcast message.
Analysis: The table below captures the analysis of this idea:

map). Processing time may delay rendering of alert,
particularly in the absence of needed A-GPS data.
Requires the CMSP to use its network resources to
broadcast the coordinates in addition to the alert
message.
Page 88The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Legacy mobile devices and feature phones will not be
able to support this capability.
Practicality Practical with some minor challenges:
If the coordinates are broadcast in a second message, then there needs to be a way to link
the two messages. This requires the development of a standard within 3GPP.
Broadcasting the coordinates consumes control channel resources which may complicate
the scheduling of when the coordinates are broadcast (and rebroadcast).
Devices which rely on MSA-mode A-GPS data may not be able to perform geo-filtering
processing.
Number of coordinates may exceed the allotted capacity for broadcasting vertices.
IPR may pose a legal block or excessive costs to the device manufacturer, OS vendor,
and/or CMSP which would likely result in higher cost for handsets to consumers.
Calculations of device location are not always 100% accurate and may be subject to error.
Mitigation To conserve broadcast channel resources, broadcast coordinates selectively. If the basic
Options broadcast area is deemed a sufficiently accurate approximation of the target alert area (e.g.,
in the case of small cells in a dense urban area), then the broadcasting of the coordinates
could be omitted. Conversely, if the broadcast area is deemed to contain sufficiently large
areas outside the target alert area (e.g., in the case of a macro cell in a rural area), then the
coordinates could be broadcast. Further considerations would need to be addressed in the
SDOs.
If the number of vertices exceeds the allotted capacity, then the polygon could be smoothed
by the Alert Originators or according to IPAWS rules and policies.
One idea would be to broadcast A-GPS data along with the coordinates. However, this option
has not been vetted by experts in the field and will result in more broadcast channel
resources required for the WEA broadcast.
An alert ID could be included in the bodies of the text message and the vertices message to
enable linking of messages (if needed).
Consumer perception may be addressed via public outreach.
D.4.2 Downloading Coordinates over WiFi Connection
Description: Upon receiving the WEA Alert Message, the WEA OS app or WEA third party
application (TPA) could be programmed to treat it as a trigger to automatically fetch more
detailed information, including the alert area's vertices, from a trusted source using the
mobile device's WiFi connection. If the mobile is capable of determining its own location,
then it could compare its location to the alert area, and render the alert, only if it is located in
the alert area. Alternatively, the mobile device could display its location vis-à-vis the alert
area. The mobile device could also simply display the alert area on a map.
Analysis: The table below captures the analysis of this idea:

information over WiFi.
Location displays may not be available on feature
phones.
Practicality Practical with some challenges:
Issuing a request over a WiFi connection to a server on the Internet requires a mechanism
for uniquely identifying the alert in question – in some cases there may be a single active
WEA alert, but sometimes there are multiple alerts.
Currently WEA Alert Messages do not contain unique alert IDs.
The WEA app would need enhanced to automatically determine availability of WiFi
connection, and make that connection automatically – the complexity of these steps may
vary from device to device, introducing a possible race condition.
Requires deployment of a trusted server to obtain additional information on the alert.
CMSPs cannot be held liable for anything but what it broadcasts.
Calculations of device location are not always 100% accurate and may be subject to error.
Mitigation Alert UID could be virtually created by having the device transmit information such as:
Options
 Hash of the alert’s text (albeit alert text is not necessarily unique and may result in
conflicting information).
 ID of the base-station which transmitted the alert – but this would not work as the
trusted server would not know the base stations where an alert is broadcast.
 The geo-coordinates of the device.
WiFi congestion could be mitigated by introducing random delays before sending a request –
this would introduce additional delays in rendering the alert to the device, however such
additional delays could be tolerable depending on the timescale of the random delays
(milliseconds, seconds, etc.)
D.4.3 Downloading Coordinates over Cellular Data Connection
Description: Upon receiving the WEA Alert Message, the WEA OS app or WEA TPA could
be programmed to treat it as a trigger to automatically fetch more detailed information,
including the alert area's vertices, from a trusted source using the mobile device's cellular
data connection (if available). If the mobile device is capable of determining its own location,
then it could compare its location to the alert area, and render the alert, only if the device
were located in the alert area. Alternatively, the mobile device can display its location vis-à-
vis the alert area. The mobile device can also simply display the alert area on a map.
Analysis: The table below captures the analysis of this idea:

Continuous operation of GPS on mobile device can

Processing time may delay rendering of alert,
particularly in the absence of needed A-GPS data.
Practicality Impractical, given the WEA design decision of no point-to-point communication.
Mitigation Point-to-point communication may be practical if the mobile device is in a (private) Femto
Options cell or a Pico cell, whereby the number of connected devices is limited. However,
implementing a system whereby point-to-point communication is allowed in (private)
Femto/Pico cells but not in macro cells is not trivial. While the implementation of this
mitigation option may make point-to-point WEA communication in Femto/Pico cells
practical, the implementation itself (of the mitigation option) is not practical. Further, the
CBC currently does not have a method to know whether a cell to which it is broadcasting is
in the Macro network or is a Pico/Femto cell.
D.5. Enablers for Device-Oriented Ideas
Note: Some of the enablers in this section have already been mentioned as part of the
mitigation options. They are described here in more detail. Also, the enablers in this section
may be combined.
The following ideas are described in this section:
 Compression of Geographic Coordinates Data
 Smoothing of Polygon
 Circularization of Polygon
 Embedding of Geographic Data in Text Message
D.5.1 Compression of Geographic Coordinates Data
Description: Geographic coordinates are expressed as latitude and longitude; ISO
6709:200828, Standard representation of geographic point location by coordinates, is the
international standard for representation of latitude and longitude for geographic point
locations. A full latitude/longitude representation (when represented in degrees) has a
preceding sign character (-/+), 6 decimal digits for latitude, and 7 decimal digits for longitude
28 ISO-6709:2008, Standard representation of geographic point location by coordinates, Second edition, July
15, 2008; http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=39242.
Page 91The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
(±DD.DDDD±DDD.DDDD). Compression of geographic coordinate data allows the
representation of the data to be shortened. The type and extent of the compression may affect
the accuracy of the data. Various methods may be used to compress the data; for example,
since the -/+ sign indicates north or south, east or west on the globe, the signs could be
dropped since the mobile device may be able to identify which corner of the globe it is in; or
at a minimum it could be assumed that the alert is applicable to a location in USA only.
Alternatively, the number of decimal places can be reduced, albeit at the price of reduced
precision; it would not be possible for the mobile device to recover the dropped decimal
places.
Analysis: The table below captures the analysis of this idea:

Practicality Practical with some minor challenges:
If compression is performed at the alert origination stage, then alert origination tools
would need to be built/upgraded to enable smoothing of polygons.

Options polygon could be visualized for the benefit of the Alert Originator, who could then provide
final approval/make necessary modifications to the post-compression polygon.
Example of a Geocode Compression Technique
Through compression techniques, the Geographic Coordinates Data of the WEA threat area
could be packaged to fit into a single LTE packet length of 280 displayable characters. The
example below is primarily for illustrative purposes, and other methods for compression are
being developed by research sponsored by DHS S&T. The result of this research, along with
any other compression techniques, should be considered as part of the ATIS/TIA feasibility
study.
In this example, a maximum usable LTE packet length of 280 displayable characters and a
polygon shaped alert area is assumed. Using the following method, up to 25 vertices can be
broadcast for locations in the northern hemisphere between 100 and 180 degrees west
longitude (Figure 13) as well as for Guam in the Eastern hemisphere. Up to 28 vertices can
be broadcast in a single packet for locations in the northern hemisphere less than 100 degrees
longitude (Figure 14). Up to 23 vertices can be broadcast in a single packet for American
Samoa in the southern hemisphere. The format for each latitude/longitude vertex is
(-)LLLL,NNNNN
Page 92The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
Where:
 (-)LLLL is latitude in decimal degrees with precision to hundredths (i.e., 2 decimal
places). Southern hemisphere values are preceded by a negative sign.
 NNNNN is longitude in decimal degrees with precision to hundredths (i.e., 2 decimal
places). Western hemisphere values are between 0 and 180. Eastern hemisphere
values are between 500 and 680, where 500 represents 0 degrees east longitude and
680 represents180 degrees east longitude.

D.5.2 Smoothing of Polygon
Description: If the number of vertices of a polygon is too large to be accommodated by
whichever mechanism is used to transmit them to the mobile device, the polygon could be
smoothed to reduce the number of vertices to an appropriate number. One example of
smoothing is to draw a new polygon whereby (a) its number of vertices is smaller than the
allowable maximum; (b) it subsumes the original polygon; and (c) it has the least amount
area outside the original polygon. There is strong a priori preference for any smoothing of
polygons to be performed at the alert origination stage of the WEA system.
Analysis: The table below captures the analysis of this idea:
Table 16: Considerations for Smoothing of Polygon
Advantages Disadvantages
Reduces the number of lat/long pairs making up the The polygon is distorted, likely expanding the original
polygon (for example from 30 lat/long pairs to 15 risk area, which in turn may cause devices outside
lat/long pairs), thereby reducing the size of the data
Page 94The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
representing the polygon. the actual risk area to receive the alert.
After the polygon is smoothed, it could result in the
same level of geo-targeting precision as what a
CMSP is achieving currently via broadcasting. In
that case, there is no advantage to this method.
Practicality Practical with some minor challenges:
If smoothing is performed at the alert origination stage, then alert origination tools would
need to be built/upgraded to enable smoothing of polygons.
The C Interface in the WEA system would need to incorporate any new limits on polygon
coordinates. Any modifications to policies or procedures of the C Interface would need
to be conducted through the appropriate SDOs.
Mitigation If smoothing is performed at the alert origination stage, then any distortion to the original
Options polygon could be visualized for the benefit of the Alert Originator, who could then provide
final approval/make necessary modifications to the smoothed polygon.
D.5.3 Circularization of Polygon
Description: One special case of smoothing is circularization. A circle needs only three
parameters: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and radius. A multi-vertex polygon can be
approximated by a circle. There is strong a priori preference for any smoothing of polygons
to be performed at the alert origination stage of the WEA system.
Analysis: The table below captures the analysis of this idea:

would need to be built/upgraded to enable circularization of polygons.

Mitigation If circularization is performed at the alert origination stage, then the distortion to the original
Options polygon could be visualized for the benefit of the Alert Originator, who could then provide
final approval/make necessary modifications to the circle.
D.5.4 Embedding of Geographic Data in Text Message
Description: Characters in the text message could be compressed to reduce the average
number of bits per character, allowing for room to add geographic data. A common
compression approach is to use fewer bits to represent more common characters, and more
bits to represent less common characters. Such an approach can be combined with reducing
Page 95The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
the size of the character set (e.g., not allowing foreign characters, using only lowercase or
uppercase letters) to further reduce the average number of bits per character.
Analysis: The table below captures the analysis of this idea:

WEA segment containing the coordinates. feasibility/potential of this approach.

the compression concepts used are not offered in a
FRAND method.
Practicality TBD based on outcome of research.
Mitigation TBD based on outcome of research.

D.6. Network-Oriented Ideas
As mentioned above, some CMSPs have already made several network-side enhancements to
improve WEA geo-targeting e.g., the implementation of polygon based alerting. The
subgroup was only able to present one, albeit impractical, new network-oriented idea beyond
what has already been implemented. The idea is to perform power-controlled broadcasting,
whereby the CMSP could lower the transmission power of an entire base station such that the
broadcast reaches a smaller overall area. Since WEA Alert Messages are broadcast on LTE
control channels, reducing the broadcast power of the control changes would negatively
impact the ability of mobile devices attached with cell site to initiate voice calls including
calls to 9-1-1 and Wireless Priority Services (WPS) for Public Safety. Consequently, this
idea is not a practical solution without negatively impacting emergency services, public
safety, and the general communications capabilities of the subscribers. The concept is
illustrated in Figure 15 below, which attempts to illustrate a case where power control would
work.

standardization. This power control option reduces the CMSP’s
coverage area for voice and data services for the
duration of the alert (which, during an Amber alert
can be as long as 23 hours), creating coverage holes
and denying service to its customers including the
ability of subscribers to make emergency calls to
9-1-1 and the ability of Public Safety to use Wireless
Priority Services (WPS) for communications access
under emergency conditions.
Practicality Not Practical:
WEA Alert Messages are broadcast on the control channel.
Current standards for cellular networks do not support real-time adjustment of the power
level of the control channel.
Re-designing cellular networks to support power-controlled control channels requires a re-
architecture of the global LTE system, global standardization, and updates to the global
LTE implementations.
Mitigation None.
Options
Page 97The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
D.7. Approaches Based on Third-Party Assistance
This approach is third-party-assisted enhancements. For example, upon receiving the WEA
Alert Message, a mobile-device may send a “should-display?” request to a third party service
over the Internet. The third-party service may be able to determine the location of the mobile
device and respond with a “Yes/No” response.
Note: The third-party assistance may need to rely on assistance from the CMSP [e.g.,
CMSP’s Commercial Location Based Services (LBS)].
The third-party-assisted geo-targeting techniques are outside the scope of this report.

Appendix E: Geo-targeting Analysis
This Appendix provides some examples of alert broadcasting scenarios with more emphasis
on the geo-targeting aspects.
For the purpose of illustration, this Appendix introduces the terms such as Warning Area,
Alert Area, Broadcast Area, and Desired Area. Warning Area is the actual area to which
WEA is in effect. Desired area is the list of cell-sectors affected due to the WEA. Alert area
is the area specified by the Alert Originator as WEA affected area. Broadcast area is the area
to which the alert is broadcast by the CMSP.
E.1. Background
Also for the purpose of illustration, a hypothetical region consisting of two counties (named
County A and County B) are considered (see Figure 16 below), and in the subsequent
examples illustrated in this Appendix, and a WEA affects users of these two counties. For the
purpose of illustration, a cell-sector is considered to be within the county if a part of that cell-
sector belongs to the county. In example shown in Figure 16, some cell-sectors may be part
of two counties.
Figure 16: Hypothetical Region Consisting of Two Counties - County A and County B
The Figure 16 shows 19 eNBs, each with 3 sectors identified as A, B and C. The cell-sectors
that belong to County A and County B are shown in Table 20.

Note: A “*” next to the cell-sector (e.g., A*) indicates that only a part of the cell-
sector lies within the indicated county boundary.
In this illustration, as can be seen in Figure 16, the following cell-sectors are outside the two
county boundaries:
 eNB 2, cell-sector A
 eNB 3, cell-sector A
 eNB 8, cell-sector C
 eNB 9, all three cell-sectors
 eNB 11, cell-sector C
The methods used to determine the Alert Area and Broadcast Area in the current geo-
targeting method are described in Section 3.2. This illustration takes only a part of those
variables.
E.1.1 Warning Area
Figure 17 shows an example where a WEA is affecting the users of two counties as shown in
Figure 16. The red-shaded area with the solid red lines is the Warning Area.
Even though the Warning Area appears to be polygon, the Alert Originators may choose the
entire county, or a part of the county as an Alert Area. Or, alternatively, the Alert Originators
may provide the coordinates of the polygon to identify the Alert Area. Other possible
methods are not included in this illustration.

receive the WEA if at least a part of that cell-sector lies within Warning Area boundary.

Area except that the entire cell-sector is included in the Desired Area.
This illustration uses the entire cell-sector for the broadcast if a part of the cell-sector is
within the Warning Area. That is why the Desired Area appears to be larger than the
Warning Area. Also, the concept of Desired Area is for illustration purpose only and as such
it does not come into the picture of WEA broadcast.
E.2. Alert Area and Broadcast Area
The examples shown here consider the following cases:
 Alert area is identified based on county boundary
 Alert area is identified based on a polygon
 Broadcast area based on the physical location of eNB
 Broadcast area based on the geographical centroid of the sector.
As explained earlier, Alert Area may be identified through other means as described in
Section 3.2.1.1 and Broadcast Area may also be performed through other means described in
Section 3.2.1.2. But, the purpose of this Appendix is to give a general idea and therefore, the
illustration is limited to the above bulleted cases.
E.2.1 Alert Area at County Level
In this case, the entire county is identified as Alert Area. So, CMSP would distribute the alert
to the entire county. The Broadcast Area can be determined based on the physical location of
the eNB or the geographical centroid of the cell-sector. Each case is illustrated below.
Broadcast Area Based on eNB Physical Location
An eNB is considered to be within the Broadcast Area if the physical location of that eNB is
within the county (i.e., Alert Area). Figure 19 illustrates the Broadcast Area for the Warning
Area shown in Figure 17.

sector lies within the Warning Area. The cell-sectors in the Desired Area are same as
the cell-sectors in the Warning Area except that the entire cell-sector is included in
the Desired Area. Broadcast area is determined if the physical location of the eNB or
the centroid of the cell-sector is in the county A or County B because Alert Area
specified by the Alert Originator is at a county-level.
Looking at the Table 25, it can be seen that Broadcast Area is different from the Desired
Area. With the eNB location being used to determine the Broadcast Area, the WEA is
broadcast to about 39% more cell-sectors than the desired number of cell-sectors and about
3% less cell-sectors than the desired number of cell-sectors. With centroid of the cell-sector
being used to determine the Broadcast Area, WEA is broadcast about 19% cell-sectors more
than the desired number of cell-sectors and 3% less than the desired number of cell-sectors.
With eNB-based method, users served by the cell-sector B of eNB-11 do not receive the
WEA. With centroid of the cell-sector based method, users served by the cell-sector B of
eNB-18 do not receive the WEA.
E.2.2 Alert Area Polygon
In this case, the Alert Area is identified with a polygon. For purpose of this illustration, in
this case, the Alert Area and Warning Area are one and the same because Warning Area
shown in Figure 17 is also a polygon. CMSP would distribute the alert to the cells that are in
the polygon. The Broadcast Area can be based on the physical location of the eNB or the
geographical centroid of the sector. Each case is illustrated below.
Broadcast Area Based on eNB Physical Location
An eNB is considered to be within the Broadcast Area if the physical location of that eNB is
within the polygon (i.e., Alert Area). The Figure 22 illustrates the Broadcast Area for the
Warning Area shown in Figure 17.

Note: A “*” next to the cell-sector (e.g., A*) indicates that only a part of the cell-
sector lies within the Warning Area. The cell-sectors in the Desired Area are same as
the cell-sectors in the Warning Area except that the entire cell-sector is included in
the Desired Area. Broadcast area is determined if the physical location of the eNB or
the centroid of the cell-sector is in the polygon because Alert Area specified by the

Looking at the Table 28, one can see that Broadcast Area is different from the Desired Area.
With the eNB location being used to determine the Broadcast Area, the WEA is broadcast to
about 42% less cell-sectors than the desired number of cell-sectors. With centroid of the cell-
sector being used to determine the Broadcast Area, WEA is broadcast about 35% cell-sectors
less than the desired number of cell-sectors. With eNB-based method, users served by the
cell-sector B of eNB-11 do not receive the WEA.

Appendix F: Future Mobile Alerting Concept
Executive Order 13407 – Public Alert and Warning System29 states “It is the policy of the
United States to have an effective, reliable, integrated, flexible, and comprehensive system to
alert and warn the American people in situations of war, terrorist attack, natural disaster, or
other hazards to public safety and well-being”. Recent natural disasters such as Hurricane
Katrina and Sandy as well as the terrorist attacks in New York City and Boston underscore
the need for redundancy and reliability in our warning networks so that people may be
alerted wherever they may be or for whatever situation they may be in.
While WEA is and should remain a voluntary service which places obligations on
Participating Commercial Mobile Service Providers, this idea goes beyond WEA which
includes non-WEA components in a more comprehensive concept. The advancement of
communication technologies in mobile devices is evolving towards 5G, and additional
capabilities may be difficult to predict. The communication capabilities of mobile devices
can only be expected to continue to advance in the coming years. These capabilities could be
used to provide additional reliability and redundancy beyond WEA particularly in light of
any natural or manmade disaster that damages, partially or in whole, our terrestrial
communications networks.
The future mobile alerting concept is for the mobile device to receive alert information from
FEMA IPAWS over multiple transmission channels that may be available in the mobile
device, to capitalize on the capabilities and attributes of each transmission channel to reach
devices in the defined alert area. Devices under this concept may include cell phones,
automobiles, computers or any device with communications access, a display screen, and
location based technology.
The concept is analogous to EAS where the message is broadcast over multiple channels
(i.e., EAS tones from NOAA Weather Radio and CAP EAS from FEMA IPAWS), but only
one of the sources is used by the receiving device and the duplicate is automatically ignored.
The alert message, along with geo-coordinates of the actual alert area to assist with geo-
targeting, is transmitted to the mobile device over all available communication channels
equipped on the mobile device. These channels may include cellular (LTE or future 5th
generation) broadcast, WiFi, cellular data (if enabled by end-user), satellite (if mobile device
is equipped with satellite receiver) and future broadcast technologies.
 In the case of cellular data and WiFi, the alert message is pushed to the mobile device
from a trusted server, which itself receives the alert message and related information
from the FEMA IPAWS alert aggregator.
 In the case of cellular systems (LTE or future 5th generation), the alert message is
sent using WEA.
 In the case of satellite transmission, a satellite provider receives the alert information
from FEMA IPAWS with the server possibly acting as a gateway with the satellite
provider. The satellite provider may perform an initial mapping of the alert area to the

Bush. http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-2006-07-03/pdf/WCPD-2006-07-03-Pg1226.pdf. Note: This

satellite coverage that best matches the alert area.
 In the case of future broadcast technologies, the alert is sent from FEMA IPAWS to
the broadcast provider who broadcasts the alert to an area that best matches the alert
area.
Upon receipt of the alert, the mobile device renders the alert and ignores duplicates which
arrive via other channels. Additional information included in subsequent alerts can also be
shared with the user to give them more information about the alert. The mobile device should
be capable of using current and future broadcast technologies as well as leveraging the
intelligence contained in devices as devices evolve in the marketplace.

In order to accommodate existing base of WEA-enabled

Implications for Mobile Device app One implementation option is to have a mobile app with the
Enhancements intelligence to execute method as described.
Would need changes to mobile device functionality to support
this alternative and any mobile device app implementation
options.
Trusted Server One implementation option is provide information to mobile
device app upon request in a secure, reliable and scalable
fashion.
May also need to be connected to IPAWS OPEN; security may
be problematic for untrusted mobile devices connecting to
IPAWS directly.
For non broadcast channels, need to provide information to
third-party WEA app a secure, reliable and scalable fashion,
whereby the information needs to be delivered to the mobile
app on a push basis.
Needs to have a direct connection to FEMA IPAWS.
Pros Supports longer WEA Alert Messages for mobile devices
which have active alternative connections.
Use of WiFi does not disrupt the cellular network.
Creates redundant distribution of the alert to reach nearly all
devices within the alert area.
Removes repetitive alerting of the device for the same alert.
Broadcast channels such as LTE cell broadcast, eMBMS and
satellite have ability to reach devices within their broadcast
area.
Satellite coverage includes the entire country and territorialThe Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2

waters and can deliver alerts even when the terrestrial system
is compromised due to natural or man made disasters.
Using location of the device as a filter to display the alert, geo-
fences the alert to the polygon created by the alert originator
no matter what channel delivers the alert to the device.
Multiple delivery channels leverages the different payload and
service capabilities of each channel to enhance reliability and
resilience.
WiFi and Broadcast technologies compliment the wireless
network.
The mobile device, using multiple delivery channels, provides
uniformity of the alert to the device.
Cons Unlike capabilities in the CMSP infrastructure which target
supporting all users and devices, older devices may not have
access to all the new capabilities of this future alert system.
This is suggesting an extremely complex and complicated end
user mobile device which is not required for the subscriber’s
basic telecommunication services. It is not envisioned that
devices described here (e.g., satellite capable) due to the
inherent cost and complexities. It is especially true since
underlying CMSP infrastructure can support longer
messages.
This option places obligations on satellite providers in addition
to CMSPs. Satellite provider obligations are under EAS and
not WEA which would complicate the rules.
This option would require a international standardization and
best practices efforts encompassing both wireless
technologies and satellite technologies.
This option would coordination between alert originators,
FEMA IPAWS, CMSPs, and satellite providers. Note: no
satellite providers are represented on this CSRIC IV working
group.
This option assumes that satellite providers perform beam
spotting but this may not be a valid assumption.
There is no information in the WEA text message to correlate it
to the original alert message.
Use of a different message ID to provide the information on the
location of the information on the trusted server would need
development efforts for the CMSP infrastructure.
Support of a different message ID to provide the information
on the location of the information on the trusted server also
requires mobile device modifications.
This option will require new mobile device designs which
could be complex and costly. If new mobile device chipsets
are required, the development could take several years and
would take even longer to be distributed to end users.
It cannot be assumed that mobile devices are connected to
WiFi.
 Mobile devices may not automatically connect to
WiFi without some other type of user intervention.
 Not every mobile device may have WiFi capabilities.
 Subscriber may have turned off the WiFi connection.
P age
115The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2
Report October 2014
 Subscriber may not have configured WiFi
connections.
 WiFi connections generally not available in rural and
remote locations.
 WiFi connections may not be available in suburban
locations beyond subscriber’s home or neighborhood
stores (e.g., coffee shop).
 If driving in a car, the mobile device may be
connected to WiFi within the car but the car is not
WiFi connected to external access points.
 WiFi connections may not be free and the subscriber
may not be subscribed to the WiFi service.
 Network congestion of WiFi connections may occur.
The trusted server may be overloaded.
The alternative must scale for potential nationwide alerts
covering 300+ million mobile devices.
There are no mobile device APIs defined for third party apps to
receive the information.
This option assumes a particular implementation in the mobile
device. At least one smartphone OS does not store the WEA
Alert Messages in a WEA inbox. Therefore, it will not be
possible for a WEA app to retrieve that alert message on that
smartphone OS.
An entity has to be identification established to be the “trusted
source”
The trusted source would need to open their systems to every
mobile device in the world with no security mechanisms.
It can be envisioned that malware or man-in-the-middle attacks
could be used to cause havoc.
Even though a larger number of displayable characters can be
broadcast, the form factors of various types and models of
mobile devices to not easily facilitate the presentation of very
large alert messages.
Challenges with Regard to WARN Act This alternative has potential conflicts with the WARN Act
requirements, which should be investigated.
Obligations on Participating CMSPs and other communications
providers need to be addressed.
The Participating CMS provider is not responsible for the
trusted source or retrieval process.
This alternative is beyond the obligations of the CMSPs.
Mitigating Factors Some users may seek additional information on their own.
There may be potentially many sources of information to
which they can turn.
There are techniques available to handle potential overloading
of trusted servers. Content staging and load balancing are
examples of potential mitigations for the overloading of
trusted server.
To correlate the message at the trusted server with the WEA
alert, additional information must be provided in the WEA
Alert Message. Additional study is required to evaluate the

character limitations and capabilities available in LTE.
The satellite industry standards body would be needed to
evaluate this alternative and provide any mitigating factors to
the impacts to the satellite networks.
