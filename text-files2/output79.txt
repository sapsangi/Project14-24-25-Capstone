1 Results in Brief
1.1 Executive Summary1
During the aftermath of a severe storm, earthquake, terrorist attack, or other natural or man-
made disaster, the rapid restoration of the E9-1-1 infrastructure may make the difference
between life and death for the public at large. Public safety personnel and emergency
responders need the ability to prioritize their rescue efforts, perform triage to help the most in
need first, and to generally be able to assess the impact to life and property.
The risk of damage or significant impairment to the E9-1-1 network following one of these “all
hazards” conditions should be considered jointly by Service Providers, Network Operators, and
Public Safety through a well-developed and routinely exercised business continuity plan. On the
other hand, when impairment does occur despite best efforts, the ability to rapidly restore the
infrastructure, and thus connectivity to emergency services, must also be planned well in
advance of any impact.
One critical consideration when reacting to a crisis situation is the prioritization of service
restoral. Many Service Providers maintain business continuity plans that address the order in
which communications are restored that usually include emergency services, government
services, internal services, and customer services.
Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) III Working Group
8 was established to modify and/or develop new Best Practices that will support communication
providers in preparing for natural or man-made disasters. These Best Practices will ensure that
communication providers are able to plan ahead and restore service quickly in the aftermath of a
disaster as well as initiate procedures that could help reduce the effects that a disaster may have
on the network. This includes how E9-1-1 traffic might be prioritized in such situations from an
infrastructure point of view.
This Final Report - Part 1 is the first part of a larger review of industry Best Practices intended
to modernize those that relate specifically to E9-1-1 and more importantly to consider the need
for Best Practices for Next Generation E9-1-1 services that may be useful in preparing for
natural or man-made disasters.
For Part 1 of the Final Report, the CSRIC III is being asked to accept this document and the
recommended Best Practices contained within, and to recommend resolution for any gaps found
by this Working Group that were determined to be out of scope during this initiative.

2 Introduction
CSRIC was established as a federal advisory committee designed to provide recommendations
to the Commission regarding Best Practices and actions the Commission may take to ensure
optimal operability, security, reliability, and resiliency of communications systems, including
telecommunications, media, and public safety communications systems.
Due to the large scope of the CSRIC mandate, the committee then divided into a set of Working
Groups, each of which was designed to address individual issue areas. In total, 10 different
Working Groups were created, including Working Group 8 on E9-1-1 Best Practices.
This Final Report – Part 1 documents the efforts undertaken by CSRIC Working Group 8 – E9-
1-1 Best Practices with respect to the long term network requirements to ensure that
communication providers are able to restore service quickly in the aftermath of a disaster. The
team considered how these Best Practices would apply to originating providers such as legacy
wireline, wireless, cable Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), internet based VoIP, E9-1-1 and
NG9-1-1 network and functional software providers, and database providers.
Working Group 8 officially started its work on November 17, 2011, and was given until June
2012 to produce this Final Report – Part 1 and December 2012 to produce a Final Report – Part
2 on overall Best Practice recommendations. The focus for Working Group 8 is to review the
existing set of 1,022 voluntary industry Best Practices developed over the years by the various
Network Reliability and Interoperability Council (NRIC) and the previous CSRIC Council.
With the introduction of Next Generation E9-1-1 services and the overall changes in technology
over the past decade an in-depth review of Best Practices that relate to Cyber security, Physical
security, Disaster Recovery and Mutual Aid, Network Reliability and Interoperability, and
Public Safety were found to be in scope for this team. This working group is made up of experts
from public safety and industry which provided an end to end E9-1-1 network view.
The team began analysis of the entire Best Practice data set and worked to identify those items
that would have a direct impact on the Working Group’s task of supporting communication
providers in preparing for natural or man-made disasters. Once the unrelated Best Practices were
removed, those that remained could be further analyzed and applied to the framework that was
developed in this report.
The team also addressed gaps that have not been historically addressed through the Best Practice
process and that, if implemented by industry, would further protect the E9-1-1 network and
improve the resiliency to survive a crisis event or at the least, assist in the rapid restoration in the
aftermath.

Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
3 Objective, Scope, and Methodology
3.1 Objective
For Final Report - Part 1, the objective was to modify and/or develop new voluntary industry
Best Practices that will support communication providers, e.g. originating providers such as
legacy wireline, wireless, cable VoIP, internet based VoIP, E9-1-1 and NG9-1-1 network and
functional software providers, and database providers, in preparing for natural or man-made
disasters.
A framework would be developed that efficiently identifies the Best Practices that are within
scope and could be used by any Service Provider, Network Operator, or Public Safety agency to
improve reliability and resiliency when developing or enhancing disaster plans or business
continuity planning.
The final objective for Working Group 8-1 “E9-1-1 Disaster Best Practices” was to focus
specifically on the prevention and restoration of the Next Generation E9-1-1 and Legacy E9-1-1
network infrastructures.
3.2 Scope3
The scope of the team was to identify current Best Practices that could apply to disaster recovery
processes or identify those that could be enhanced with minor modifications. Given this scope,
the group found it essential to place an initial focus on the 1,022 Best Practices developed over
the years by previous NRIC Focus Groups and CSRIC Working Groups. The Working Group is
also tasked with the modification of the Best Practices potentially associated with E9-1-1
infrastructure and will continue its work following submission of this Final Report - Part 1. The
Final Report - Part 2, due in December 2012, will address these remaining modifications4.
The full Best Practice data set does not apply to disaster recovery processes; therefore it was in
scope for this team to review and reject those Best Practices that would not directly relate to the
prevention and restoration of the E9-1-1 network infrastructure and facilities. Within scope was
also the identification of Best Practices, and to identify gaps, that will assist in prioritizing E9-1-
1 service restoration in the aftermath of an all hazards event.
It should be noted that industry Best Practices are voluntary in nature and may not apply to all
Service Providers due to scope, cost, feasibility, or resource limitations. Best Practices should
be used by experts who have the overall experience to interpret the Best Practice in the manner
in which it was intended.

papers/research-proposal.htm
4 It should be noted that Best Practices identified in this Final Report - Part 1 may be altered by
the final Working Group 8 team in December of 2012, however, the identified current Best
Practices are in force at the time of this report and are appropriate for use by industry to
implement these recommendations.

Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
3.3 Methodology5
Due to the scope of the work required Working Group 8 was separated into three sub-teams to
address specific areas of the Best Practice work. Sub-team 8-1 “E9-1-1 Disaster Best Practices”
was tasked with modifying and/or developing new Best Practices that will support
communication providers in preparing for natural or man-made disasters. This sub-team
developed Final Report - Part 1 which focuses on the Best Practices that will ensure that
communication providers are able to restore service quickly in the aftermath of a disaster. This
includes how E9-1-1 traffic might be prioritized in such situations. This report was due June
2012.
Sub-group 8-2 “Current E9-1-1 Best Practices” is tasked with reviewing the existing
CSRIC/NRIC E9-1-1 best practices and recommend ways to improve them, accounting for the
passage of time, technology changes, operational factors, and any identified gaps. Their
deliverable is due December 2012.
Sub-group 8-3 “PSAP and Consumer Best Practices” has the challenge of creating two new best
practice data sets to address and capture the experiences of Public Safety organizations and to
provide consumers a standard set of recommendations on how to properly use 9-1-1 during
critical times. Their deliverable is also due December 2012.
3.3.1 Approach to E9-1-1 Disaster Recovery
3.3.1.1 High Level Model – Legacy E9-1-1
The more traditional, or historical, means of transmitting E9-1-1 calls from Service Providers
and network operators involves passing voice, Automatic Number Identification (ANI), and
Automatic Location Identification (ALI) using the Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) Public
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
This model includes E9-1-1 call delivery methods involving legacy E9-1-1 networks6 where call
delivery is based on central office and wireless Mobile Switching Center (MSC) dedicated E9-1-
1 trunk groups to a selective router(s) and then dedicated trunk groups to the PSAP. Voice over
Internet Protocol (VoIP) E9-1-1 calls are transitioned onto the PSTN network through media
gateways and, along with wireless E9-1-1 calls, utilize a Pseudo ANI to provide needed
information at the PSAP. Traditionally, the Legacy E9-1-1 Network will route calls to a backup
location or alternate route in the event the primary PSAP becomes unavailable.
Legacy E9-1-1 infrastructure reliability and resiliency are dependent on factors such as:
- Diversity of facility routes in the originating Service Providers and the legacy E9-1-1
providers interoffice transport systems.
- Mated selective routers and/or tandems to handle failover and excessive call delivery.

papers/research-proposal.htm
6 Legacy network in this Final Report - Part 1 is a term used to define the telecommunication
Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) network
architecture pre-internet protocol and pre-Next Generation platform.
Page 7 of 112The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 8
Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
- Signaling System – 7 architecture for call setup on dedicated trunk groups.
- Robust E9-1-1 call flow over multi-frequency (MF) Centralized Automatic Message
Accounting (CAMA) trunks from selective routers to PSAP.
- Sufficient trunk capacity to process E9-1-1 calls at all points in the legacy network.
Figure 1: Legacy E9-1-1 Model
3.3.1.2 High Level Model - Multimedia
The Next Generation of transmitting E9-1-1 calls from Service Providers and Network
Operators involves passing voice, data, and video simultaneously over internet based facilities.
These new platforms are mostly independent of the traditional legacy network and are designed
in a mesh arrangement that provides for a robust and resilient network.
This multimedia model includes E9-1-1 call delivery methods involving internet and cloud-
based services. Call delivery could also still be based on traditional legacy network up to the
point in the network where it is transitioned onto the IP network through media gateways. VoIP
and next generation wireless network E9-1-1 calls will route entirely over the IP network
maximizing the inherent reliability of the internet to deliver E9-1-1 information. The
multimedia model includes routers, gateways, IP protocols, etc. that allow dynamic routing of
E9-1-1 calls to PSAPs in either a traditional primary/secondary setup or through a more robust
distributed “one to many” application.
Multimedia E9-1-1 infrastructure reliability and resiliency are dependent on factors such as:
- Diversity within Internet based networks in a mesh or distributed fashion.
- Ability to recover from cyber based events.
- Protection from cyber security threats.
- Media gateway availability.
- Robust databases that support E9-1-1 call delivery.

Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
Figure 2: Multimedia Model
3.3.1.3 Elements for Best Practice Study
In both the Legacy E9-1-1 and Multimedia models there are specific elements that the Working
Group identified where Best Practices would be applicable for prevention and recovery efforts
related to disaster recovery and business continuity planning.
Legacy Providers:
Best Practices for this element include those that address the traditional E9-1-1 network as
previously described. This element also addresses the transition points between the legacy TDM
network and the IP network when considering VoIP.
Internet Based:
Best Practices for this element include those that address not only the physical assets associated
with prevention and restoration but also the cyber issues that have been brought into play by the
introduction of the Next Generation platform.
Databases:
Best Practices for this element include those that consider preventative and restoration of critical
databases that are needed for proper E9-1-1 call completion. Examples of critical databases
include the data used to perform real time routing of an emergency call, and/or to deliver the
ALI to the PSAP. These databases are typically provisioned in redundant architecture methods
with offsite backup copies of the data created regularly.
Pre-Call and Call Time Software Functions:
Best Practices for this element include those that address the underlying software needs that are
critical to the ability of both the Legacy E9-1-1 and multimedia models to properly perform call
setup and timing functions. Examples of Pre-call and Call Time software functions include pre-
Page 9 of 112The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 8
Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
populating E9-1-1 routing tables when service is installed rather than obtaining customer
location information for routing purposes at the time of the call.
Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) based:
Best Practices for this element include those that address prevention and restoration of the
traditional network elements and facilities that are needed to process voice E9-1-1 based calls
through the legacy network. Examples of PSTN related items are E9-1-1 trunk groups, route
diversity, and selective routers/tandems and associated diverse network elements, etc.
Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet):
Best Practices for this element include those that address prevention and restoration of the next
generation network elements and facilities that are needed to process IP voice, data, and video
based calls through the NG9-1-1 network. Examples of ESInet related items are routers,
gateways, Border Control Functions (BCFs) and a dedicated, managed IP network infrastructure
used to transmit the voice, text, and video. In many cases, Best Practices for ESINets include
the use of multiple IP network infrastructures as a collective to increase redundancy and
resiliency.
Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs):
Best Practices for this element include those that apply to the reliable accessibility to the E9-1-1
network by the public and those that address the rapid restoration of the network in the aftermath
of a crisis.
Other Entities:
Best Practices for this element include those that apply to third party providers of Next
Generation IP or cloud-based services required to process E9-1-1 calls through any Next
Generation network. Examples include Network Operators that provide ALI/ANI/PANI lookup
services, call routing through non Service Provider networks, etc.
4 Analysis, Findings and Recommendations
4.1 Analysis7
Working Group 8-1 analysis encompassed the review of 1,022 current Best Practices whose
implementation would enhance the security, reliability, operability and resiliency of
infrastructure for communications industry segments.
Prior to beginning work, a preview of the entire Best Practice set was done by the full Working
Group to quickly ascertain which Best Practices had a potential E9-1-1 implication with an eye
toward Next Generation technology, which of those appeared to related to a disaster recovery or

Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
business continuity issue, and those that could be used with some modification by PSAPs and
Public Safety, or to enhance public education on the use of E9-1-1.
Once these individual lists were created, Working Group 8-1 was provided the 548 Best
Practices that had the potential to fall in scope of the team’s work. The next step was to develop
a definition that would provide the team a roadmap for further refining the Best Practice list
down to those that would qualify as an E9-1-1 Best Practice used in preparing for natural or
man-made disasters. The definition follows:
“A Best Practice is a suggestion that through its implementation will have a direct impact on
preparing for a natural or man-made disaster or through implementation will have a direct
impact on the prioritization and restoration of the E9-1-1 infrastructure following an event. A
second criterion of a Best Practice is that the suggestion is currently in use by one or more
participants in the industry.”
Next, the team looked for a way to present their findings in a manner that could be quickly
applied by the industry or be blended into their existing business continuity plans. The answer
to this came from work done previously on a Hurricane Checklist developed by industry experts
in disaster recovery and business continuity8 by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry
Solutions (ATIS) Network Reliability Steering Committee (NRSC). The concept of developing
a checklist using the appropriate Best Practices and identifying the elements that they would
apply to would give industry a quick guide to use in their internal preparations.
Finally, a gap analysis process needed to be included in the Final Report - Part 1. As the team
reviewed each Best Practice they were asked to record any gaps they found that were not
addressed from their expert point of view. These gaps and recommendations are included in the
Recommendations section of this Final Report - Part 1.
Each of the 548 Best Practices provided to this Working Group 8-1 was compared to the
definition discussed above. Through careful analysis, the original list was reduced from 548 to
262 that the team determined would qualify as an E91-1 Best Practice for use in preparing for a
natural or man-made disaster.
4.2 Findings
The E9-1-1 Best Practice Disaster Preparedness Checklist provides a list of current Best
Practices that apply to the “Legacy E9-1-1” and “Multimedia” models developed by Working
Group 8-1. Each Best Practice applies to one or more elements with a check (X) in each of the
columns that the team identified as applicable. The figure below illustrates the format the team
adopted for the checklist.
8 ATIS NRSC Hurricane Checklist http: http://www.atis.org/docstore/product.aspx?id=25649
Page 11 of 112The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 8
Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
Figure 3: E911 Best Practice Disaster Preparedness Checklist
The team found that many existing Best Practices were equally relevant to the E9-1-1 network
due to the commonalities between the technologies. This was most prevalent in the Next
Generation E9-1-1 platform, which being based on internet concepts found Best Practices that
applied over several categories.
Best Practices identified for the checklist were found in nearly every category of Best Practices
available. Included in the checklist is a column that identifies the category the Best Practice
applies to and the Status of “All”, “Critical”, “Highly Important”, or “Important” that applies to
each Best Practice9. The categories are determined by the Best Practice Number assigned by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) following approval by the Council. Best
Practice numbering format is described below:
Description of Best Practice Numbering
For existing NRIC/CSRIC Best Practices10: Each Best Practice has a unique number that
follows the numbering format: X - Y - Z # # #
X = the current, or most recent, NRIC/CSRIC Council (e.g., 8 in 2009-2010)
Y = the Council in which the Best Practice was last edited
Z = 0-4 for Network Reliability and Interoperability
= 1 for Disaster Recovery and Mutual Aid
= 3 for Public Safety
= 5 for Physical Security
= 8 for Cyber Security
# # # = any digits, where every Best Practice has a unique Z # # #
Due to the work being done by the larger Working Group 8 in modifying and modernizing E9-1-
1 related Best Practices, it was decided that this team would not recommend modifications to the
existing Best Practices unless there were only slight modifications needed to clarify the Best
Practice for this specific project. Any significant modifications would be done by the Working
Group and presented during the Final Report – Part 2 due in December 2012. It should be noted
that the 262 Best Practices chosen for this checklist met the definition defined by the team
without any modifications necessary.

December 14, 2011.
Page 12 of 112The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 8
Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
4.3 Recommendations
Communications organizations should evaluate and implement those Best Practices which they
deem appropriate. These organizations should institutionalize the review of Best Practices as
part of their planning processes and assess on a periodic basis how implementing selected Best
Practices might improve the proficiency and reliability of their operations11.
During the creation of the E9-1-1 Best Practice Disaster Preparedness Checklist there were a
total of 24 gaps documented. Where noted, the team has recommended a new Best Practice be
created and approved by Council for use in furthering the teams work. In recommending a new
Best Practice, this Working Group complied with the Best Practice Guidelines recommended by
the ATIS NRSC tutorial:
Best Practices Guidelines
1. Proven through actual implementation – more than “just a good idea”
2. Address classes of problems (rather than one time issues)
3. A single concept should be captured in each practice (one thought, one practice)
4. Should not endorse specific commercial documents, products or services
5. Developed through rigorous deliberation and expert consensus
6. Confirmed by a broad set of stakeholders
7. Should not be assumed to be applicable in all situations or to all industry types
8. Does not imply mandatory implementation
Gap Analysis:
Listed here are 24 gaps that were identified during the analysis phase. Where possible,
following the gap identified WG8-1 has proposed a Best Practice to eliminate the gap.
1. Service providers, network operators, first responders, and other public safety personnel
should monitor weather services such as NOAA and/or subscribe to automated storm
alerts or RSS feeds on known storm related events such as Hurricanes to stay informed
and prepared. This could be the trigger for early communications and coordination
efforts.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Weather Awareness: Service Providers, Network Operators, Property Managers, and
Government should subscribe to weather monitoring services (e.g. NOAA, RSS storm
feeds) on known storm related events and used as a decision point for implementing
early communications and coordination efforts between entities.
2. A one source official emergency internal and external contact online database that can be
accessed by appropriate personnel that is maintained regularly and updated frequently
could be addressed and/or adopted by Service Providers, Network Operators to provide a
11 ATIS Best Practice website, Tutorial Page, http://www.atis.org/bestpractices/Tutorial.aspx
Page 13 of 112The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 8
Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
reliable and common database to use for disaster events.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Emergency Contact Database: Service Providers and Network Operators should
consider establishing a single database (one source) that is maintained regularly and
updated frequently with internal and external contact information that can be accessed by
appropriate personnel.
3. No Best Practice could be found addressing a method to mass alert external contacts and
critical customers that the Service Provider or Network Operator has entered a disaster
recovery posture in preparation for a known event such as hurricane, flooding, fires, etc.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Disaster Event Mass Alerting: Service Providers and/or public safety systems should
utilize various communications services (i.e. outbound calling services) as necessary to
alert specific groups, or the public as a whole based on pre-arranged criteria, or those
within a particular geographic area deemed to be susceptible to an event or disaster.
4. As part of business continuity planning, alternate logistics delivery locations should be
preplanned and communicated to appropriate personnel.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Alternate Logistics Delivery: Service Providers and Network Operators, as part of their
business continuity planning should identify alternate logistics delivery locations,
document them during pre-planning activities, and communicate to appropriate
personnel.
5. Effective communications prior to and following an event should set expectations early,
address problem solving, prioritization of services, and timeframes for restoration.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Effective Event Communications: Service Providers, Network Operators, Property
Managers, and Government should include in their business continuity plans clear
guidance for setting and communicating expectations, problem solving, and prioritization
of services (e.g. E9-1-1) including timeframes for restoration following a natural or man-
made disaster.
6. Spare batteries or quick chargers (e.g. power sticks) should be considered for remote
devices such as smart phones, blackberries, tablets, etc. Expect battery life to be
diminished if low or no cell signal is available.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Remote Device Spare Batteries: Service Providers, Network Operators, Property
Managers, and Government when planning for a disaster should address spare batteries
Page 14 of 112The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 8
Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
or quick chargers (e.g. power sticks) as well as other critical components being available
due to the potential of not being able to re-charge the devices in the normal method.
7. Consider cell phones from alternate providers to maximize the potential for accessing the
wireless network.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Alternate Cell Providers: Service Providers, Network Operators, and Government
should consider acquiring cell phones and services from alternate providers to maximize
the potential for accessing the wireless network in the aftermath of a significant event.
8. Consider participation in the Alerting and Coordination Network (ACN) and Shared
Resources High Frequency Radio Program (SHARES) through the National
Coordinating Center (NCC) for Telecommunications.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Emergency Communication Plans: Service Providers and Network Operators should
consider participating in emergency communications programs offered through the
National Coordinating Center (NCC) such as Alerting and Coordination Network (ACN)
and Shared Resources High Frequency Radio Program (SHARES).
9. Service Providers and Network operators should quickly establish communications with
Public Safety Answering Points (PSAP) and other public safety contacts and pass status
on network issues to help mitigate issues related to call processing of E9-1-1 calls.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Public Safety Communications: Service Providers and Network Operators should as
part of their business continuity planning quickly establish communications with Public
Safety Answering Points (PSAP) and other public safety contacts and pass status on
network issues following a disaster to help mitigate issues related to call processing of
E9-1-1 calls.
10. Service Providers, Network Operators, and Public Safety should develop a switch
replacement philosophy in the event of unrecoverable damage to critical infrastructure
used to process E9-1-1 calls.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Switch Replacement Philosophy: Service Providers and Equipment Suppliers as part
of their business continuity planning should develop a switch replacement philosophy in
the event of unrecoverable damage to critical infrastructure used to process E9-1-1 calls.
11. Service Providers, Network Operators, and Public Safety should develop a re-entry
strategy for the impacted area.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Page 15 of 112The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 8
Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
Re-entry Strategy: Service Providers, Network Operators, and Government should as
part of their business continuity planning develop a re-entry strategy for the impacted
area following a disaster to reduce restoration timeframes for critical services (e.g. E9-1-
1).
12. Consider establishing a joint E9-1-1 strike team dedicated to the assessment and
restoration of the E9-1-1 network following an event. The team would consist of
members of communication providers, public safety, and first responders.
Recommendation:
The team could not determine if any Service Provider or Network Operator has
implemented such a system or process. Based on this, we cannot recommend creation of
a Best Practice; however, the team does recommend that future consideration be given to
this identified gap which would provide dedicated resources to the rapid restoration and
prioritization of E9-1-1 services in the aftermath of a natural or man-made disaster.
13. Service Providers and Network Operators should ensure their communications process
efficiently advises employees on how to obtain ongoing instructions during the aftermath
of an event.

efficiently advises employees on how to obtain ongoing instructions during the aftermath
of an disaster.
14. Service Providers, Network Operators, and Public Safety should coordinate with officials
(e.g. Police, Military) to provide protection and safety of workers restoring the E9-1-1
infrastructure.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Disaster Worker Safety: Service Providers, Network Operators, and Government
should coordinate with officials (e.g. Police, Military) to provide protection and safety of
workers restoring the E9-1-1 infrastructure in the aftermath of a natural or man-made
disaster event.
15. Service Providers, Network Operators and Equipment Vendors should coordinate
agreements for the immediate shipping of product following an event.
Recommended New Best Practice:

Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
16. Service Providers and Network Operators should regularly assess the availability of work
supplies (e.g. pumps, blowers, chain saws, inside and outside wiring, outside network
interfaces, etc.) in preparation of disaster events.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Work Supply Availability: Service Providers and Network Operators as part of their
business continuity planning processes should regularly assess the availability of work
supplies (e.g. pumps, blowers, chain saws, inside and outside wiring, outside network
interfaces, etc.) in preparation of disaster events.
17. Service Providers, Network Operators, and Public Safety should validate computer
backups are up to date prior to a known event and located in an offsite or cloud storage
arrangement. Lack of proven good back up data can delay or make restoration
impossible.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Up to Date Backups: Service Providers, Network Operators, and Government should
validate computer backups are up to date prior to a known event (e.g. hurricane,
flooding, and wild fires) and located in an offsite or cloud storage arrangement to prevent
delaying or making restoration of computer data impossible.
18. Service Providers and Network Operators should assess transport equipment and their
protection facilities to ensure operability to prepare for a known event (e.g. hurricane,
flooding, and fire).
Recommended New Best Practice:
Protection Facilities Assessment: Service Providers and Network Operators should
assess transport equipment and their protection facilities to ensure operability in
preparation for a known event (e.g. hurricane, flooding, and wild fires).
19. Service Providers and Network Operators should establish proactive patrolling of critical
Inter-Office Facility (IOF) routes to identify damages earlier for faster restoration.
Recommendation:
The team could not determine if any Service Provider or Network Operator has
implemented such a process. Based on this, we cannot recommend creation of a Best
Practice; however, the team does recommend that future consideration be given to this
identified gap which would provide dedicated resources to the rapid restoration and
prioritization of E9-1-1 services in the aftermath of a natural or man-made disaster.
20. Service Providers and Network Operators should consider establish roaming restoration
teams to quickly reduce troubles.
Recommendation:
Page 17 of 112The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 8
Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
The team could not determine if any Service Provider or Network Operator has
implemented such a process. Based on this, we cannot recommend creation of a Best
Practice and this gap should be addressed by a future CSRIC.
21. Service Providers, Network Operators, and Public Safety should establish preplanning
for the redirection or rerouting of critical circuits and communications in affected areas
that may impact E9-1-1 call delivery.
Recommended New Best Practice:
Redirection and Rerouting of Critical Circuits: Service Providers, Network
Operators, and Government should establish preplanning for the redirection or rerouting
of critical circuits and communications in affected areas that may impact E9-1-1 call
delivery during a natural or man-made disaster event.
22. Service Providers, Network Operators, and Public Safety should document and provide
power down and power up procedures for critical equipment. Power down processes can
extend service and power up process is critical to reduce start up times.
Recommended Best Practice:
Power Up and Down Procedures: Service Providers, Network Operators should
document and provide power down and power up procedures for critical equipment to
extend service and reduce start up times if critical equipment is powered down.
23. Text to E9-1-1 implementation.
Recommendation:
The implementation of “Text to E9-1-1” by some wireless Service Providers is in
progress at the time of this Final Report - Part 1. Based on this, we cannot recommend
creation of a Best Practice and this gap should be addressed by a future CSRIC.
24. Best Practices do not have a “Public Safety” option.
Recommendation:
During review and creation of recommended Best Practices that relate to the E9-1-1
network the team found that no category existed for the use of “Public Safety” in the
verbiage of the Best Practices. Traditionally, the available options have been “Service
Provider, Network Operator, Equipment Supplier, Property Manager, and Government”.
The importance of Best Practices as related to E9-1-1 apparently omits one of the key
contributors to the success of any implementation process. This omission resulted in our
recommendations using “Government” as an implication of “Public Safety”. Working
Group 8 recommends that an implementer category be recognized for future Best
Practice development of “Public Safety” to appropriately recognize the importance of
this key contributor to E9-1-1 reliability and resiliency.

Final Report - Part 1 - June 2012
5 Conclusions
Working Group 8 – E9-1-1 Best Practices concludes that providing a set of voluntary industry
Best Practices that, if implemented, will strengthen the up-front planning processes for Service
Providers, Network Operators, Property Managers, and Government entities. These Best
Practices when used in preparing for disaster events that may interrupt E9-1-1 services during
and in the aftermath of a natural or man-made disaster can minimize and/or mitigate their effect
on the E9-1-1 network infrastructure.

capacity, 2) bring up a known good DNS server from scratch
on different hardware, 3) Reload and reboot machine to a
know good DNS server software (from bootable CD or spare
hard drive), 4) Reload name resolution records from a trusted
back-up. After the DNS is again working, conduct a post-
mortem of the attack/response.
Recover from DNS (Domain Name Server) Denial of Service
Attack: If the DNS server is under attack, Service Providers
and Network Operators should consider one or more of the
following steps 1) Implement reactive filtering to discard
identified attack traffic, if possible, 2) Rate-limiting traffic to
8-8-8528 the DNS server complex, 3) Deploy suitable Intrusion Cyber Security Critical X X X X X X X X X
Prevention System in front of DNS servers, 4) Deploy
additional DNS server capacity in a round-robin architecture,
5) Utilize DoS/DDoS tracking methods to identify the
source(s) of the attack, or 6) Move name resolution service to
a 3rd party provider.

Connectivity—An alternative for handling E9-1-1 calls during
periods of failure in the connectivity between an originating
network and the emergency services network is to use the
PSTN as a backup (i.e., fallback) connection mechanism
between the caller’s originating network and the PSAP. Such
connectivity may route calls to the appropriate PSAP without
the associated information that would normally be present.
If the primary path to the emergency services network is
interrupted by a ""failure"" (not when all trunks are simply
busy), the call may be forwarded over the PSTN to a number
specified by the PSAP that is answered at the PSAP on a 24/7
basis. It is desirable for that specified number to be a type that
can provide the original CallerID/Automatic Number
Identification (ANI). This best practice does not propose that
any 9-1-1 call delivery stakeholder bypass acceptable
congestion control techniques commonly applied within the
industry for 9-1-1 calls.

9-1-1 Dedicated Trunks—Similar to Option 1 above (PSTN
backup) for completing 9-1-1 calls when the primary transport
facility is interrupted by a ""failure"" (not when all trunks are
