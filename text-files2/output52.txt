1 SUMMARY
The communications sector provides the basis for information exchange, including voice, data, video,
and Internet connectivity, for all other sectors. As such, it is incumbent upon the industry to ensure
that our Nation maintains a communications network that offers reliable and resilient service in the
face of significant equipment or system failure, which is sufficiently survivable to provide some
continuity of service during major emergencies.
The electricity transmission system in the United States is one of the greatest engineering
achievements of the 20th century. Unfortunately, there is growing evidence that the U.S.
transmission system is under stress. Growth in electricity demand and new generation, lack of
investment in new transmission facilities, and an incomplete transition to fully efficient and
competitive wholesale markets have led to the emergence of transmission bottlenecks. These
bottlenecks increase the risks of blackoutsi.
Cellular Base Stations (aka Cell Sites) are dependent on commercial power to operate, and when
power fails, the Cell Site will fail without a reliable source of uninterrupted backup power.
The CSRIC WG9 Backup Power Sub-team has come together to identify the approaches and
recommendations to share backup power resources to enhance the reliability of the Nation’s critical
communication infrastructure. The following recommendations will help strengthen the reliability of
commercial communications systems during major emergencies.
2 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Disaster preparedness, recovery, and restoration efforts have been a major part of all wireless
providers’ Business Continuity Plans for decades. Not only is communications network continuity
important for consumers during natural disasters, but many first responders such as firefighters, law
enforcement, paramedics, utility workers, and relief workers often look to commercial wireless
networks as a critical supplement to their public safety and private land, mobile, communications
systems during these times.
The CSRIC Working Group 9 Backup Power Sub-team was divided into four focus groups to drill
down on separate areas, challenges, and recommendations to increase the resiliency and reliability of
the telecommunications infrastructure.
These focus areas are: 1) Site Priority and Selection, 2) Regulatory practices to enable shared backup
power deployment, 3) Technical Requirements for Shared Backup Power Deployment, and 4) Sharing
of Portable Generators and Fuel resources.
It should also be noted that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is currently
engaged in the research and development of a disaster resilience framework document that outlines
the shortcomings that must be addressed in order to heighten community resiliency. In chapter 8 of
6The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
that document, NIST outlines recommendations relating to telecommunications infrastructure and
backup power.
Working Group 9 recommends that the FCC share the following output and recommendations,
including research, findings, and considerations, outlined throughout this document with NIST and
other working groups engaged in similar work.
2.1 POWER BACKUP REQUIREMENTS
The power requirements based on kilowatts (kW) for telecommunications sites and supporting
facilities can be categorized as follows:
 Single Operator Site (outdoor cabinets) – 5kW to 10kW
 Single Operator Site (shelter site) – 30kW to 50kW
 Multiple Operator Site – 5kW to 50kW per operator
2.2 TYPES OF BACKUP POWER
A variety of backup power devices are used on telecommunications sites. The type and size of
systems depend upon the facility power demand, the designed backup time, and the critical nature of
the site. Each operator has their own specific requirements and is best suited to determine their
potential liabilities. The operator will be responsible for ensuring that the configured backup
system(s) meets their specific policies and regulations. These requirements may include
environmental systems related to equipment operating parameters.
2.3 BATTERIES
There are several types of batteries available for power backup. Examples of common batteries used
at sites include ventilated lead acid (VLA), valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) or non-spill, and Nickel
Cadmium (Ni-Cd). Batteries provide a direct current (DC) power source for the site equipment and
are generally sized for two to eight hours of back-up. In some instances, the batteries are sized for 15
minutes of back up only to provide enough run time for a standby generator to restore power.
Battery backup generally will not provide power to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)
systems. Without proper cooling, sites can overheat before the battery has depleted. Therefore, a
means to provide a temporary alternating current (AC) power source, whether a permanent fixture
or portable fixture, should be available.
2.4 STANDBY STATIONARY GENERATORS
Standby Generators are utilized for long duration outages and are sized to support the entire facility
for the site equipment, battery recharge, and HVAC operation. Standby generators are deployed in
addition to battery backup systems.
There are multiple generator types and fuel sources, as outlined below. All need to be properly sized
for the site requirements which include site operation as well as power inrush due to equipment start
up. Proper sizing is also critical when deploying for multiple operators.
7The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
Run time duration for fuel source sizing should be based on peak load. See section 5.6.3 in this
document for recommended fuel tank sizing guidelines. This should be adjusted based on site access,
remoteness of site, and available resources. For example, sites with generators that are located on
remote mountains should have fuel to support longer durations, whereas sites located close to fueling
centers can have less fuel.
2.4.1 PORTABLE GENERATORS
When stationary generators are not available, portable generators can be deployed to sites.
Operators typically have a means for temporary connection through the use of Cam-LokTM connectors,
generator plugs, or other quick connection devices. When planning for use of portable generators as a
shared source, pre-planning for deployment must occur before actual emergencies. Considerations
must be made for sizing, management, fueling, installation, and security. Portable generators are
highly prone to theft during an emergency situation. Likewise, consideration should be given to
securing the fuel for both fixed and portable generators. For some sites with considerable battery
backup, portable generators may be moved from site-to-site to recharge the batteries.
2.4.2 FUEL CELLS
Fuel cells convert the chemical energy in a fuel directly to electrical energy. They can be more
efficient and reliable than generators and have no, or a very small emissions footprint. Like
generators, fuel cells are used for providing extended duration backup.
2.4.3 TYPES OF FUEL
The following is a list of backup power sources and their fuel types:
Standby Internal Combustion Generator:
 Diesel
 Propane
 Natural Gas
Fuel Cell:
 Hydrogen
 Methanol
 Natural Gas
2.5 RESEARCH
In an effort to better understand present generator deployments and distributions the working group
gathered a random sample of site and generator information from 600 random sites across the
Eastern U.S. The sample shows that currently, there is an average of 2.5 carriers collocated at each
site. Based upon this sampling there is a possibility that two or more carriers could potentially come
together at these shared locations to create an immediate efficiency regarding shared resources.

3 SITE SELECTION AND PRIORITIZATION FOR SHARED BACKUP POWER
3.1 OVERVIEW
When all carriers at multi-tenant sites can tie into a landlord provisioned or shared third party fixed
backup power generator, it becomes an effective and environmentally friendly way to back up the
telecommunications infrastructure. Rather than each carrier providing their own extended backup
power source, a multi-tenant unit can provide a fixed generation asset that carriers could potentially
access if at a reasonable costs. And, instead of each carrier needing its own space–space issues
becoming increasingly more difficult for each sequentially arriving carrier–a multi-tenant generator
model provides efficiencies. Additionally, a single generator, rather than multiple generators, lowers
capital and operating expenditures and avoids escalating environmental, noise, space, and other
similar issues. Regarding the supply chain, there would be fewer organizations vying for an often
constrained diesel fuel supply while providing for a reduced risk of diesel spills.
When multiple requirements for backup power exist at a single cell site, options for a shared source
could be explored. A single multi-tenant generator asset can be owned, operated, and maintained by
the Tower Aggregators, Network Operators, or another Third Party Provider.
3.2 CHALLENGES
Wireless networks are power hardened to different degrees from a backup power perspective based
on the carrier’s needs (some carriers already have standby emergency generators at a majority of
their sites). Rooftop sites will always be very difficult to power harden due to the logistics of
generator placement. Even if the carrier is attempting to run a cable to a ground level generator, in
urban environments there is often no ground level space that the landlord can or will make available.
Additionally, power hardening a rooftop site after the fact is much more difficult because of the need
to secure cranes, permits, as well as weight, space, and vibration restrictions at these locations. The
only truly feasible method to power harden a rooftop site is to tie into the landlord generator or
install a natural gas generator which requires the building owner to run natural gas to the roof. Some
9The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
building owners do not like the idea of a spark ignited generator on their roof. Building owners may
be more amenable to generator installation when the unit supports carrier relevant facility critical
functions such as security systems.
Additionally, at tower sites, installing a fixed backup power source after a tower is commissioned is
much more difficult than installing it as part of the initial build. This is primarily because the space set
aside for a fixed generator is limited in many compounds where there are multiple carriers present.
3.3 COVERAGE VS CAPACITY
For a single carrier, basic wireless service coverage can typically be restored more quickly and at a
less prohibitive cost than fully restoring previously existing network capacity. For example, high sites
that cover a larger area would be restored first when possible. This would bring coverage to a large
area, but might compromise the reliability of service inside buildings because the average signal
strength at the location will be lower. There might be many more dropped calls when many cells are
out of service, because the amount of cell "overlap" might not be sufficient for reliable handoffs. In
general, not all carriers will necessarily have the same needs from each site, nor do carriers
necessarily provide the same coverage footprint with the same sites. This is due to the differences in
technology, numbers of antennas and antenna height on the tower, frequency band, capacity, and
individual carrier deployment priorities.
Providing a basic coverage area may be possible with a fraction of the cell sites within an area. Those
higher coverage sites selected to be protected could, by themselves efficiently provide a basic
coverage footprint to be used by other critical services. This is in line with existing priority
communications program objectives that would allow critical users access to a congested network via
Wireless Priority Service (WPS) and/or Government Emergency Telecommunications System (GETS).
As wireless networks transition to all Internet Protocol (IP) based infrastructure, telecom providers
will have greater capability to manage traffic flow, provided they are not prohibited from doing so.
After a disaster, if networks are damaged and heavily loaded, voice traffic could be prioritized above
data services. Low priority web traffic demands could have their access to the network limited, while
voice and higher priority data traffic is accommodated1.
3.3.1 CRITICAL SERVICES
While coverage sites are a good starting point to identify and prioritize opportunities for shared
backup power, each carrier will likely have a selection of sites that are considered their highest
priority. Some examples of these are sites that: generate a significant amount of traffic and/or
revenue, cover first responder/public safety locations such as Emergency Operation Centers, provide
service to major commercial airports/ports, important customers, and other critical infrastructures
(healthcare, energy, transportation systems, banking & finance, etc.).
1 The introduction of Self Organizing Networks and LTE Direct capabilities will impact carrier decisions on network
restoration however as future implementations they are not considered in this document.
10The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
3.4 OTHER CO-LOCATED SITES
Those sites that are not considered to be a ‘Critical Server’ or a ‘Coverage Site’ still add value and may
be good candidates for sharing backup power. With the deployment of Long Term Evolution (LTE),
backhaul requirements from cell sites have increased by orders of magnitude. Increased bandwidth
requirements have driven a resurgence of short-haul microwave networks. Microwave network
topology can result in points where the traffic from dozens of sites can converge to a single fiber
access node. While protected rings are often deployed for redundancy, it is still good engineering
practice to harden all fiber access nodes.
3.5 LEVEL OF RISK
3.5.1 COMMERCIAL POWER FAILURE FREQUENCY AND DURATION
Risk is a function of probability and impact. Just over half of all commercial power failure outage
events are less than one hour in duration. This can be a helpful first step in developing a risk
management strategy. While one may conclude that it’s an acceptable risk to ignore the longer
duration outages, it would be a mistake to do so. More frequent short-duration events result in a
comparatively small threat to network operation/reliability. However, less frequent long-duration
events result in a disproportionately larger threat. In other words, while the frequency of events
lasting less than one hour is much higher, the events lasting longer than 8 hours can account for a
much greater impact in terms of service outages if extended backup power is not provided.
Additionally, shorter duration outages can generally be managed by site battery backup.
3.5.2 AREA LEVEL RISK
Power hardening provides a varying degree of greater reliability in different parts of the country.
With every investment in improved network reliability, there is an increase in capital cost, and
generally an increase in perpetual operating expense as well. Providers manage these costs along
with other costs such as the rising costs of deploying faster networks. Hence, the decision to
undertake any investment is a function of weighing potential consumer benefits relative to the
costs. Even though a shared backup power resource can make sense, carriers may elect to not seek
a backup power solution in every part of the country.
Consideration must also be given by market to the possibility of that market’s most likely causes of
long-term power outages also causing long-term backhaul outages. If backhaul is likely to be also
lost, the value of power hardening is greatly reduced.
Appendix A outlines an analysis of different risk factors to assist in prioritizing geographies for
Backup Power Hardening.
3.6 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SITE PRIORITY AND SELECTION
The following recommendations regarding site priority and selection are not meant to be classified as
best practices, but rather, considerations that the FCC should share with NIST and other working
groups engaged in similar work.
 In High Risk Markets, carriers could consider jointly sharing a generator.
11The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
 Carriers could seek opportunities to tie into a landlord generator on rooftop sites if possible.
 Carriers could identify “Coverage Sites” and “Critical Server” sites as a starting point for those
sites they wish to have backup power. A prioritization of several broad categories could be a
useful starting point.
 Property Managers, aggregating tower resources, or carriers could implement a shared resource
deployment model that supports backup generator(s) for existing carriers as well as new carriers
utilizing a tower.
 Carriers and Tower Companies could discuss options under a non-disclosure agreement to
discuss shared generator opportunities for locations where they are collocated in the same
compound. Possible options to consider are the option to join together to provide a multi-tenant
generator tie-in or seek a third party to provide the shared generator for a monthly fee.
 Carriers could prioritize backup power hardening in markets/areas with the most risk of natural
disasters that also have the least reliable/resilient electrical power grid (“High Risk Markets”).
 The reasonableness of the monthly charge to tie into a landlord owned generator should relate to
the costs of deployment, as this is a capital intensive venture with high costs to operate.
 Microwave network topology could result in points where the traffic from dozens of sites can
converge to a single fiber access node. In such cases, carriers could consider investigating
opportunities to harden these locations.
 Jurisdictions could consider aiding operators in routing natural gas connections to urban cell
sites. Assistance may be found in having fire department or city subject matter experts provide
advice on the relative safety of gas lines running to carrier generators.

4 REGULATORY PRACTICES FOR BACKUP POWER SHARING
4.1 OVERVIEW
The purpose of focusing on the regulatory practices surrounding backup power sharing was to
establish a list a of existing backup power equipment regulations in order to help expedite approval
from state and federal regulatory agencies, zoning boards, building codes, fire departments, etc. for
deployment of such equipment during an emergency situation. While some rules for backup power
deployments are necessary, Working Group 9 recommends the FCC work with local, state, and federal
regulators to adjust policies to ease the burden on carriers and Tower Companies in deploying
permanent and or portable backup power resources that would provide backup power during
emergencies.
4.2 FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL REGULATIONS
Federal Regulations
Federal, National Electric Code (NEC) and International Building Code (IBC) regulations for standby
equipment are specified in various National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) codes. The
12The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
transportation of fuels is regulated by the US Department of Transportation (DOT). Emission
regulations governing emergency standby diesel generators primarily rest with the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The NFPA requires that Optional Standby Power Systems be installed, tested and maintained in
accordance with NFPA 110, Standard for Emergency and Standby Power Systems.
Fuel Storage tanks are covered under NFPA-30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code.
Enforceable under Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and many state and local regulations,
NFPA 30 provides safeguards to reduce the hazards associated with the storage, handling, and use of
flammable and combustible liquids.
State and Local Regulations
State, regional, and local jurisdictions can dictate their own requirements which govern pollutant
limits, runtime usage, and reporting requirements, including the California Air Resources Board and
the South Coast Air Quality Management District. These regulations vary from state-to-state and by
local jurisdictions. An exhaustive list of such regulations will be substantial and is therefore not
provided here. The following website will help guide backup resource owners and operators to
determine the state and local regulations governing the deployment and sharing of backup resources
during emergency situations (select ADOPTIONS tab):
http://www.iccsafe.org/cs/PMG/Pages/default.aspx
4.3 GENERATORS
4.3.1 DIESEL GENERATOR REGULATIONS
Diesel is currently the most popular fuel source for standby generators. Diesel is a widely available
fuel with a well-established distribution network. However, diesel does require great care in its
handling due to environmental impact from spills as well as having the largest emissions
considerations.
Diesel is classified as Class 2 fuel. The EPA issued its final exhaust emission regulations in 2010 for
emergency Standby Diesel Generator Sets, which took effect on January 1, 2011.
The EPA began to enforce limitations on exhaust emissions for off-highway diesel engines in 1996,
and in 2006, for stationary diesel generator sets. These ‘progressive’ regulations (called Tier levels)
became more stringent in the years since, and have had a major effect in substantially lowering the
levels of nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM) and non-methane
hydrocarbons (NMHC).
13The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
By the time Tier 4 Final regulations were introduced in 2013 and 2014, the NOx and PM levels from
diesel exhaust will have been reduced by 99%. These Tier levels were introduced and ‘staggered’
over this timeframe, dependent upon the generator diesel engine horsepower (or metric mechanical
kW equivalent) and not the kW output per the generator nameplate. Diesel engine manufacturers
were able to achieve compliance by implementing in-engine or internal design changes (e.g.
combustion chamber, fuel injection pressure, valve timing, cooled exhaust gas recirculation, and
engine controls) to meet the Tier 2 and Tier 3 regulations and this has resulted in an emission
reduction improvement of more than 85%.
Alternative Standards
The EPA has found that the low exhaust emission rates with Tier 2 and Tier 3 engines will be
acceptable for Emergency Standby Power (ESP) installations and thus they are exempt from the need
to use Tier 4 Interim and Tier 4 Final diesel engines. However, the smaller horsepower (HP) sizes
(below 50HP) are already required to comply with Tier 4 Interim (since 2008). In addition, ESPs have
historically only been shown to run for less than 200 hours per year, and thus, have a very small
impact on the local air quality. There is no limit to the duration of run-time hours in true emergency
occasions such as utility outages or equipment malfunctions. This means that such generators will be
14The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
in compliance with EPA through 2015 and beyond where they are used strictly for emergency duties.
Currently, they will be allowed to run for up to 100 hours per year for testing and maintenance
purposes, including discretionary and not-for-profit non-emergency usage.
Definition of “Optional Standby Systems”
The 2014 Edition of the National Electric Code (NEC) defines “Emergency Systems” in Article 700,
“Legally Required Standby Systems” in Article 701, and “Optional Standby Systems” in Article 702. All
cell site generators are classified as optional standby systems and are governed as such by NEC
Article 702 and NFPA 110. Use of the NEC defined term “emergency” creates unnecessary confusion
with Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) and should be avoided.
Optional standby systems are generator installations that only operate (i.e. limited operation) upon
the loss of a normal power source such as the utility or mains grid. In this instance, when the normal
power source is lost, the generator starts to supply the electrical loads. Once the normal power
source is reestablished and the generator shuts down, these electrical loads are once again supplied
from the normal source. All operation of the generator must be recorded by the user and referenced
to a non-resettable hour recorder fitted to the generator. Any new diesel engines that are built after
the effected introduction date of the Tier 4 regulation must also be fitted with a permanent label
stating that they are only for emergency use.
Exemptions and Challenges
State and local authorities may dictate stricter regulated emissions limits. The following are examples
of these exemptions:
 The State of California will not exempt emergency diesel generators with these applicable
EPA rules from 2011 and will enforce even stricter regulations for non-emergency stationary
engines. This will result in the large majority of generator sets sold into California to use
exhaust after-treatment devices, beginning in 2011.
 Certain regions and locations in the US may also enforce more stringent stationary emission
regulations than the EPA diesel engine Tier levels. These include non-attainment areas -
normally large population centers - where high local emissions, local weather conditions, or
ozone concentrations exceed the EPA air quality standard recommendations. For example,
we can refer to such as areas of Southern California, areas of many New England states,
Atlanta, GA, Puerto Rico, and Houston, TX. This means that a stationary diesel-fueled
emergency generator set – even if certified to the appropriate EPA Tier level, may not meet
the local requirements.
As the EPA lowers National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) levels across the nation, more
areas are likely to fall into non-attainment status and therefore further engine emission regulations
are likely to be implemented. Although the newer EPA National Emission Standards for Hazardous
Air Pollutants (NESHAP) rules allow for unlimited running of generators during emergencies, very
few states have adopted this approach and still limit the use of generators during emergency
situations.

Additional Notes
EPA Diesel Off Road Emissions Compliance
 Technology of engines must be compliant based on when the unit was purchased. If it was
purchased in 2007, the 2007 rulings apply to that unit.
 Spill Containment – Liquid containment based on the amount of fuel in the unit. Must have
measures in place to ensure there are no spills when the unit is deployed.
 Noise regulations are set locally.
4.3.1.1 Fuel Transportation Regulations
The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) issues most of the “Transportation” regulations in
Title 49 – Transportation, Code of Federal Regulations (49 CFR). The Hazardous Materials
Regulations (HMR) are in the volume containing Parts 100-185 and govern the transportation of
hazardous materials in all modes of transportation – air, highway, rail, and water.
Transport of No. 2 Diesel Fuel
 A Department of Transportation (DOT) 406 tank is not required but is suitable for the
transport of Diesel Fuel under the United Nations Hazardous Material Code 1202 and North
American Hazardous Material Code 1993 (UN1202/NA1993) on public roadways per federal
transportation requirements.
 A DOT 406 tank is also suitable for the transport of No. 2 Diesel Fuel (UN1202/NA1993), but
is not required per Special Provision B1 found in 49 CFR 172.102, p. 325 noted in the
Hazardous Materials Table found in 49 CFR §172.101. Special Provision B1 specifies that
materials with flash-points above 38°C (100°F) and lower than 93°C (200°F) are subject to 49
CFR §173.241(Bulk packaging for certain low hazard liquid and solid materials).
 49 CFR §173.241 specifies that non-DOT specification cargo tank motor vehicles are suitable
for the transport of such fuels. No. 2 Diesel Fuel (UN1202/NA1993) has a flash-point greater
than 58°C (125°F).
Additional Information Regarding Fuel Transport:
 A double-wall tank is not required per federal transportation requirements for the transport
of diesel or gasoline in bulk containers, but may be required by local or other jurisdictional
regulations.
 Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standards 142 and 2085 do not apply to mobile fuel storage
containers, only to stationary above ground storage tanks as specified in the scope of the UL
142 standard, part 1.7.
The following quality standards are typically required:
 UN 31A Group Y Intermediate Bulk Container (IBC): Such IBCs are suitable for the transport
of Gasoline (UN1203) on public roadways per federal transportation requirements codified at
49 CFR §173.242 sub-part d. Group Y IBCs are authorized to transport UN Packaging Group
(PG) II materials, which includes Gasoline (UN1203) and No. 2 Diesel Fuel
(UN1202/NA1993). See 49 CFR §178.703(Marking of IBCs).

 UL 142 as an aboveground storage tank. See above.
4.3.2 PROPANE GENERATOR REGULATIONS
NFPA 58, Liquefied Petroleum (LP) Gas Code, is the industry benchmark for safe LP Gas storage,
handling, transportation, and use. This code mitigates risks and ensures safe installations to prevent
failures, leaks, and tampering that could lead to fires and explosions.
4.3.2.1 Transportation of Propane
General requirements for the transportation of LP gas in cylinders are found in 49 CFR § 173.301.
(1) Paragraph (c) requires that, "A container for which prescribed periodic retest has become due
must not be charged and shipped until such retest has been properly made."
(2) Paragraph (g) requires that containers charged with flammable gases must have their valves
protected by one of the following methods:
(a) By equipping the containers with securely attached metal caps of sufficient strength to
protect the valves from injury during transit.
(b) By boxing or crating the containers so as to give proper protection to the valves.
(c) By so constructing the containers that the valve is recessed into the container or
otherwise protected so that it will not be subjected to a blow when the container is dropped
on a flat surface.
(d) By loading the containers compactly in an upright position and securely bracing in cars or
motor vehicles, when loaded by the consignor and to be unloaded by the consignee.
Methods (a), (c), and (d) apply to portable and stationary LP gas cylinders transported by propane
marketing companies. Method (b) is used for small non-refillable cylinders.
(3) In addition to these specific requirements, the other regulations regarding container labeling,
vehicle placarding, shipping papers, and emergency information covered in other guides in this
reference apply as well.
4.3.3 NATURAL GAS GENERATOR REGULATIONS
NFPA 54, National Fuel Gas Code (NFGC) covers the installation and operation of fuel gas piping
systems, appliances, equipment, and related accessories, with rules for piping system materials and
components, piping system testing and purging, combustion and ventilation air supply, and venting of
gas-fired appliances and equipment.
Natural gas generators are almost always deployed at sites that have piped natural gas. The increased
availability of natural gas in the US has made natural gas generators more attractive for use at sites.
However, it should be noted that in the event of an emergency situation or disaster, the natural gas
suppliers may elect to suspend the supply of natural gas if there is a possibility of a gas line break.
This was evident during the Super Storm Sandy event of 2012. Some natural gas generators are
17The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
capable of utilizing other fuels, which may be transported to the site. Otherwise, such sites should
plan to accommodate a portable backup resource for emergency situations.
It should also be noted that on-site power generators are used mostly during power outages created
by natural disasters. The preferred method is to provide self-contained on-site power backup
equipment with a fuel source, which provides ample run-time and can be continually replenished.
4.4 FUEL CELLS
Fuel cells provide a clean and reliable source for power backup. This is a new technology and so far,
they have been deployed at thousands of wireless cell sites in the US. Fuel cells provide DC power
output and are therefore more suited for outdoor cabinet sites, which require DC power only. In some
cases, inverters are used to provide backup for AC powered equipment.
NFPA 853, Standard for the Installation of Stationary Fuel Cell Power System applies to the design,
construction, and installation of stationary fuel cell power systems. The scope of this document
includes the following: (1) A singular prepackaged, self-contained power system unit (2) Any
combination of prepackaged, self-contained power system units (3) Power system units comprised of
two or more factory-matched modular components intended to be assembled in the field (4)
Engineered and field-constructed power systems that employ fuel cells.
4.4.1 HYDROGEN FUEL CELL REGULATIONS
NFPA 2, Hydrogen Technologies Code, provides fundamental safeguards for the generation,
installation, storage, piping, use, and handling of hydrogen in compressed gas (GH2) form or
cryogenic liquid (LH2) form. This code is derived from NFPA 55 specifically for hydrogen gas.
General requirements for the transportation of hydrogen cylinders are found in 49 CFR § 173.302.
4.4.2 METHANOL FUEL CELL REGULATIONS
Methanol (CAS: 67-56-1, NIOSH: PC-1400000, DOT: 1230, UN-1230, NA-1230) is classified by the
International Code Council (ICC) and the NFPA under the Uniform Fire Code (UFC) as an, “IB
Flammable Liquid,” and by the UN as a, “1993 Class 3 Flammable Liquid.” The NFPA and DOT rank
flammability as a 3 primary hazard, and toxicity as a 6.1 ranked secondary hazard. Guidelines for
handling IB flammable liquids are provided by codes and standards published by ICC, NFPA, and the
IFC.
Guidance for safe storage of methanol is provided by ICC, NFPA, and IFC, and is available in:
 NFPA 1, Uniform Fire Code
 NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code
4.5 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REGULATORY PRACTICES FOR BACKUP POWER SHARING
Although the local, state, and federal regulations mentioned in the above sections have proven
successful at lowering pollutants, they also serve to potentially inhibit the efficient deployment of
18The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
generators and/or other backup power solutions to cell sites and other communications facilities
during emergencies.
Our recommendation is for the FCC to work with local, state and federal regulators to explore
alternatives to lighten these regulations as they apply to wireless infrastructure in an effort to
streamline the deployment of permanent and or temporary backup power resources enabling those
facilities to operate during times of emergency.
5 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BACKUP POWER SHARING
5.1 SCOPE
Develop a framework for how stationary and portable shared standby power resources can be
accomplished from an engineering, installation, and maintenance practice perspective. This section is
designed as a job aid to assist tower owners, carriers, and third parties in areas such as engineering
design considerations, sizing, and how to evaluate standby power options per site conditions.
Generic block diagrams describe the various stationary and portable shared generator configurations.
5.2 OVERVIEW
Carriers have deployed a variety of standby power alternatives at cell sites, including a combination
of batteries, stationary standby generators, fuel cells, and portable generators. The type and size of
systems depend upon the facility power demand, the designed backup time, and the critical nature of
the site. Each operator has their own specific requirements and is best suited to determine their risk
management strategies. The operator will be responsible for ensuring that the configured backup
system(s) meets their specific policies and regulations.
Deploying stationary standby generators or fuel cells for every carrier at every site can be costly and
in many cases, such as urban rooftop sites, technically challenging. During a widespread disaster
recovery effort, portable generator resources and fuel availability are strained. Sharing standby
power resources may provide carriers a method in which to improve resiliency at a reduced cost, or
to stretch limited resources. However, it is important to note that all shared standby generator
scenarios are inherently less resilient than each carrier having their own stationary standby
generator. If a single shared generator fails, the entire site is out of service. If each carrier has its own
dedicated generator and it fails, then only that carrier is out of service.
During a disaster, if every carrier deploys a portable generator, it can create logistics problems with
parking and fuel delivery access. At the site in Figure #5-1 (below), one carrier owns the site and has
a stationary standby generator that serves its facilities. Other carriers lease space at the tower.
During this disaster recovery, the tenant carriers each deployed portable generators. The first two
portable generators consumed the available space inside the fence, forcing the third carrier to park
his portable genset outside. This exposes the portable genset to a greater chance of theft or
vandalism. The two portable generators inside the fence block access to the host carrier’s fuel tank,
restricting the ability to refuel.
19The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
If the stationary standby generator has the capacity to serve the total power requirements for the
site, then this site is an example of where shared standby power resources can be a win-win for all.
The generator owner benefits via revenue from increased lease rates and the ability to access and
refuel his standby generator. The tenant carriers benefit by not having to deploy limited portable
resources at this site, not having to schedule multiple refuel visits, and by not being the “odd man out”
who has to park on the street.
Figure #5-1 – Multiple Portable Genset Deployment – Possible Shared Standby Power Opportunity.
5.3 TYPICAL CELL SITE CONFIGURATION
To understand the shared stationary and portable standby power options, we need to understand
how carriers currently deploy dedicated stationary and portable standby power.
A typical shelter configuration that includes a dedicated stationary standby generator is shown in
Figure #5-2 (below). Major power related components include:
 AC electrical infrastructure,
 DC power plant, and
 Standby AC Generator
The AC electrical infrastructure consists of the commercial AC service, automatic transfer switch
(ATS), and AC distribution panel board. DC power plant consists of rectifiers, batteries, and DC
distribution. The stationary standby generator is typically located outside the shelter, in an enclosure,
as shown in Figure #5-3 (below).

Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
Figure #5-2 – Example Cell Site Configuration – Shelter with a Stationary Standby Generator.
Figure #5-3 – Typical Stationary Standby Generator in an Enclosure
A typical cabinet based configuration that includes a stationary standby generator is shown in figure
#5-4 (below). The fundamental difference between shelters that utilize HVAC versus a cabinet based
configuration that relies on convection cooling is the equipment is more environmentally hardened in
a cabinet and does not require air conditioning. The absence of air conditioning reduces site power
requirements, typically by nearly half. More importantly, it eliminates the inrush current from a
compressor, which allows for smaller standby generator sizing. Given the predominant shelter design
21The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
includes 2N redundant HVAC units, eliminating the inrush current is significant. Generator sizing will
be discussed in greater detail in section 5.6.
Figure #5-4 – Typical Cell Site – Cabinet on a Pad with a Stationary Standby Generator
5.4 STATIONARY SHARED STANDBY POWER SYSTEMS
5.4.1 AC VS DC POWER IN A SHARED GENERATOR SCENARIO
AC standby generators are the logical choice for shared standby power applications. Code regulations
and wiring methods for AC distribution to multiple tenants are well defined and understood, while
code regulations and wiring methods for DC distribution to multiple tenants are either non-existent
or poorly understood. This effectively eliminates DC generators and fuel cells that produce a DC
output from shared standby power application consideration. DC generators and fuel cells are viable
solutions when dedicated to a single carrier.
While it is true that inverters can be added to convert the DC output of a DC generator or fuel cell to
AC, thus overcoming the code regulations and wiring methods concern, the addition of an inverter
raises its own concerns:
 Diminished resiliency, as it introduces a single point of failure. N+1 or 2N architectures are
required to overcome single point of failure, which increases cost and complexity.
 Diminished energy efficiency. When combined with N+1 or 2N designs, which has an inherently
lower utilization, energy efficiency is reduced even more.
22The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
 An AC generator is a more logical design than a DC generator plus an inverter.
Finally, DC generators or fuel cells that do not use an inverter require the use of DC powered cooling.
While an individual carrier may choose to deploy DC cooling at a site, the odds that every carrier at a
site has deployed or is willing to deploy DC cooling, is virtually zero. This document will focus on
shared standby AC design options.
5.4.2 STATIONARY SHARED STANDBY AC DESIGN OPTIONS
It is recommended that one of the two following designs should be considered when deciding which
standby AC system to employ. There are two basic choices in stationary shared AC standby power
system design:
 Recommended Design – Shared stationary standby generator equipped with an individual
ATS for each tenant, as shown in Figure #5-5 (below). This design is the most favored design
among carriers and tower owners at existing shared stationary standby generator sites.
 Alternate Design – Shared stationary standby generator equipped with a single ATS, as shown
in Figure #5-6 (below). This alternate design is more logical if the site is new with no existing
electrical infrastructure. The ATS connects to a Main Distribution Panel (MDP), with breakers
for each tenant. A remote controlled relay to turn off power to each tenant may be required,
particularly to sequence adding each tenant to the genset load, to limit inrush current.

5.5 PORTABLE SHARED STANDBY POWER SYSTEMS
5.5.1 PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations regarding portable shared standby power systems are not meant to
be classified as best practices, but rather, considerations that the FCC should share with NIST and
other working groups engaged in similar work.
The recommendation would be for carriers, network operators, and carrier aggregators who are
considering deploying a generator as a shared resource, to consider the following:
 Multiple plug and cord interfaces (e.g., Cam-LokTM, Appleton, Hubbell; reference Table #1).
It is important to document what genset plug is present at each site by carrier. A pre-
defined set of cords and plug adapters that mate will be required, including agreement on
where they will be stored. Failure to plan ahead may necessitate hiring an electrician during
the event to perform final connections.
 Service sizes versus actual load. Many service sizes will be 240V 200A (48 kVA) per carrier,
but actual load may be much less (perhaps 10-20%). A fleet of shared portable generators
sized at 200 kW to serve multiple carriers may be oversized, if the actual cumulative load is
in the 20-40 kW range.
 Fuel Reserve. Most portable generators have a limited fuel tank capacity, which is typically
much less than what a stationary standby generator would be engineered for. Limited fuel
reserve capacity places additional strain on resources to refuel more frequently. If a shared
portable generator solution has to be refueled every 8-12 hours, it may not be a practical
solution during an extended natural disaster.
 Site Access. Road closures and police checkpoints are common during a widespread natural
disaster. A fleet of portable generators and other service vehicles can be rendered idle, as
seen in Figure #5-7 (below) after Hurricane Ike. Credentials to provide access should be
arranged when possible as part of the planning process. For sites located in or on secured
25The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
facilities with electronic controls the carrier should assess the capability to attain access
during power outages.

 Where feasible, portable generator owner should consider limiting the weight of a portable
trailer to 3700 lbs. to enable the unit to be towed by most ½ ton pickup trucks.
 The portable generator owner should consider installing Global Positioning System (GPS) or
General Packet Radio System (GPRS) tracking devices as a theft deterrent.
 Shared portable generator agreements should consider staging of the generator in advance
of a pending threat or disaster event.
Applications for a shared portable generator solution include space constrained sites, where there is
no physical space for multiple portable generators (reference Figure #5-2 above), and cabinet sites
due to smaller loads at cabinet sites. Cabinet sites are also more likely to be served by existing fleets
of smaller portable generators that carriers already own.
One method of addressing the existing variety of generator plugs is the use of a distribution box, as
shown in Figure #5-8.
26

Advantages Disadvantages
 Good fit for existing sites.  Theft.
 Restores entire site.  More frequent refueling, exacerbated
by larger generator and load size.
 Best Plug and Cord flexibility.
 Access to deploy and refuel may be
restricted.
A very similar shared portable generator solution is shown in Figure #5-9. In this case, the cord and
plug compatibility is fixed, based on what is installed via the on board generator distribution box.
However, with plug adapters, there is still flexibility to serve multiple carriers with variable plugs.

5.5.2 PORTABLE GENERATOR PLUG
A generator plug is a generic term that indicates a type of connector used to connect a generator to
the equipment it needs to support. The term can be generically applied to both the corded plug and
receptacles at the equipment (aka, tap box) and portable generator.
There are different types, but all perform the same basic function.
Most carriers will keep a database of what type of service and connection is at each site, in addition to
cable length needed and suitable locations for a portable generator to be placed. This helps
streamline communication during an outage, allowing the carrier to ensure the generator is
dispatched of the proper service type with the correct Gen Plug on board.
Most generator teams carry an assortment of adapters and/or connectors to be able to fabricate a
cable in the field. This is also common as the distances to the connection point can vary, depending on
suitable location, and/or available space at the time of deployment.
Proper planning and a maintained, current database is the key to quick, trouble free deployments.
Not only is it important to know the connection specifics at the site, the plan should be
comprehensive to include generator providers, maintenance teams, refueling vendors, and
landscaping/access clearing crews.
5.6 GENERATOR SIZING
5.6.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
Most carrier commercial AC service at a wireless facility is at 240V / 200A for a maximum power
requirement of 48kVA. Many carriers deploy 35-50 kW generators, which at a typical 80% load
equals 28-40kW maximum expected continuous load. When a generator is oversized, the drawbacks
are primarily economic, as long as the load is large enough to prevent wet stacking and the fuel can be
30The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
consumed in a reasonable amount of time. When a generator is undersized, it cannot function
properly. Mitigating actions may include load sequencing or load shedding. Ultimately, the generator
must be replaced, as loads grow. Thus, the natural tendency is to oversize the generator.
Right sizing a generator increases risk of requiring a generator upgrade in the future (i.e., as tenant
demand grows or new tenant enters site). Replacing a generator with a larger one will adversely
impact the economics of the original agreements. Zoning, permitting, and regulatory requirements
increase costs and can impede the future ability to replace a generator.
In the shared portable generator scenario, where manual transfer switches are utilized, generator
owners and carriers need a defined procedure to bring each carrier on-line. In some cases, it may be
necessary to consider sequencing loads within each carrier, such as delaying HVAC start for some
minor time period, to mitigate inrush current. These details should be negotiated as part of the
shared generator agreement.
5.6.2 DISADVANTAGES TO OVERSIZING A GENERATOR
In a shared stationary standby generator scenario where multiple carriers will be served,
conservative power estimates for each carrier compound to oversize the generator are needed. A
good understanding of the actual load per carrier is required to ensure the shared generator is not
grossly oversized, while sized to adequately handle inrush current, particularly from multiple HVAC
compressors starting at the same time.
Generators are expensive to buy, install, and maintain. The primary disadvantages of oversizing a
generator are economic and environmental (i.e. increased invested capital, wasted fuel, fuel
degradation, wet stacking, maintenance costs, etc.).
Example: Consider a shared generator owner who sizes the generator assuming four (4) carriers will
be ultimately served by the generator. If each carrier is assumed to have a 40 kW continuous load,
then a 200 kW generator is selected (200 kW * 80% max load = 160 kW). To provide 72 hours
reserve, the calculated fuel tank size is ~1,150 gallons. Given the standard product sizing for many
fuel tank manufacturers jumps from ~1,000 gallon to the ~2,000 gallon size, it is likely the 2,000
gallon size will be selected. Now assume that only 1 or 2 carriers sign up to the shared generator
agreement, and each only has a 20 kW load, for a total load of 40 kW. It may take 500 hours at 40 kW
load to consume 2,000 gallons of fuel. Under normal routine maintenance engine runs, this may
equate to 5-10 years to consume the fuel (assuming there are no commercial AC outages during this
time).
The American Society for Testing and Materials rates diesel fuel stability at one year. If an extreme
event occurs in year 3, it is likely the fuel filter will become clogged and the generator will stall within
the first 24 hours of operation. Fuel stabilizing additives are commercially available that will extend
the storage life of diesel to some extent, but it is likely that in this example the generator owner will
be forced to periodically replace degraded fuel.
Shared generator owners may have to disregard the typical fuel tank sizing rule of thumb to “round
up to the next standard tank size.” Another method to mitigate fuel degradation is not to fill the tank
31The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
completely if the tank is oversized for the realized load, although water accumulation resulting from
condensation is a concern with partially filled above ground tanks.
5.6.3 FUEL TANK SIZING
 48-72 hours at full capacity is desirable at wireless sites to support critical activities for
stationary standby genset installations. Larger fuel tanks may trigger environmental and
hazardous material storage and permitting requirements.
 As discussed in the previous section, the typical rule of thumb is to round up to the next
standard size tank. In the case of a shared generator, where the generator owner is unsure
how many carriers will eventually sign up for the service and thus what load may be
realized, consideration should be given to right size the fuel tank, or not to completely fill
the tank under normal conditions.
 Portable fuel tanks have a practical limit to fuel reserve capacity. This limit presents a
challenge for a fleet of large shared portable gensets – if the fuel reserve is limited to 24
hours or less, can the generator owner logistically refuel a large number of sites
continuously during an extended event?
5.6.4 MANAGING CARRIER LOAD GROWTH
Generator owners and carriers must determine how to manage the reporting of growth of each
carrier’s load. Agreements may need to specify that carriers are required to report back growth in
power demand to the shared generator owner. One possible scenario may be to establish a kW limit
allocation for each carrier and have the carrier report when they will exceed their limit.
5.7 SITE CRITERIA
Site conditions are a key component in determining the best design for a given site. General
considerations include:
 Matching fuel supply, refueling capability, and standby power source to site conditions.
 Understand permit requirements and any generator exercise time limits (e.g. in an EPA
Clean Air Act non-attainment area).
Match standby power source and size to the most likely type(s) of disaster events for the region.
5.7.1 EXAMPLES OF SITE CONDITIONS THAT MAY DICTATE STANDBY GENERATOR DESIGN
The following examples are included to demonstrate why site conditions must be considered when
designing a standby generator solution.

Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
Figure #5-11 reflects a site that has been engineered to be resilient to the anticipated disaster that
may affect the site. This wireline site is located in the New Orleans “bowl” area, which is below sea
level. A flood event is the most likely disaster, as evidenced after Hurricane Katrina. Thus, placing
the equipment and standby generator on an elevated platform above the anticipated flood plain is a
prudent design. In addition, local codes prohibit above ground diesel fuel tanks. Given that it is very
difficult to refuel an underground diesel fuel tank during a flood event, a natural gas fueled generator
is a viable option. While not a perfect solution (site is subject to flood hazards such as floating debris
slamming into the ground level meter, uplift of buried piping), this site did survive Hurricane Katrina.

Figure #5-12 is an example of a gulf coast cell site that did not survive, due to poor fuel system design.
The standby generator and wireless equipment were placed on a platform above the anticipated
storm surge and survived. However, the aboveground propane fuel tank was torn from its pad,
rupturing its piping and rendering the standby generator useless.

5.7.2 FUEL ALTERNATIVES
 Diesel Fueled Generator: Diesel will be the most universally available fuel source. Major
generator manufacturers have regional distributors who stock parts and employ certified
technicians and mechanics. Thus, the diesel generator is the logical first choice for shared
standby power. Disadvantages include: air permitting, spill containment, diesel fuel tank
leak detection, property setback, and noise abatement requirements. Environmentally
sensitive sites, such as wetlands, National parks, State parks, golf courses, or urban rooftops
may be poor candidates for diesel fueled standby generators.
 Biodiesel: Pure biodiesel (designated B100) should never be considered for use in a
carrier standby generator. However, blended biodiesel up to 5% (designated B1 – B5) may
be considered, and can improve diesel fuel performance. In order to comply with EPA ultra-
low sulfur diesel (ULSD) requirements, many refineries or distributors are adding up to a
2% biodiesel blend (designated B2). 2% Biodiesel also improves lubricity and is harmless
to a standby generator (although some major generator manufacturers may not agree).
Many times, the refineries or distributors are adding the 2% blend without notifying their
customers. Blends higher than B5, however, should generally be avoided. There are
concerns regarding long term storage, cold weather performance (higher cloud point
temperature), algae growth, and warranty voidance. For further information, see U.S. DOE
NREL "Biodiesel: Handling and Use Guidelines," Fourth Edition, January 2009.
 Gasoline Fueled Generator: Gasoline is highly flammable, more prone to theft, and more
toxic to the environment if there is a spill. For these reasons, gasoline fueled generators are
typically rejected for telecommunications standby applications.
 Natural Gas Fueled Generator: The most obvious advantage to natural gas (NG) fueled
generators is the elimination of refueling. However, NG is rarely available at remote cell
sites, which eliminates it from consideration at most rural sites. In addition, NG mains may
be turned off by fire officials immediately after a seismic event, wildfire, tornado, or any
other event deemed necessary. NG disruptions are typically local in nature, as opposed to
regional. In those urban and suburban non-seismic areas where NG is available, it can be a
viable choice.
 Propane Fueled Generator: Propane can be a viable alternative where it is available.
When a propane fueled generator is selected, consideration should be given to a buried
propane tank with a cathodic protection system. Benefits of a buried propane tank include
elimination of most forms of vandalism and protection from storm surge (assuming the
flooding recedes before refueling is necessary). Note that many standby generators can be
fueled by either NG or propane, making propane an alternate back-up fuel source for NG
fueled generators. Disadvantages of propane include: code setback and clearance
requirements, vandalism (aboveground tanks), and refuel capability of local distributors -
particularly after an extreme event.
 Hydrogen Fuel Cell: Obvious advantages for hydrogen fuel cells are zero-emissions and
nearly silent operation. Fuel cells are an alternative to traditional diesel, NG, or propane
generators. Air-quality permits required for combustion generators in California are not
required. The noise emissions from the fuel cell are minimal, typically less than a Base
Transceiver Station (BTS) cabinet. Additionally, environmental permitting, maintenance,
34The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
and inspection costs associated with diesel generators and diesel fuel tanks are avoided.
Primary disadvantages include high cost, limited reserve capacity, and hydrogen as the least
available fuel source. Sites with a stationary fuel cell have still required portable diesel
generator deployments during extended natural disasters, as shown in Figure #5-13. Fuel
cell systems are best suited for sites in areas with strict regulatory requirements or are
environmentally sensitive. However, due to the DC output of a fuel cell, the focus team does
not see an opportunity for using fuel cells as a shared source of standby power.

5.8 MAINTENANCE
Any standby power system is undermined if maintenance is ignored. Generators must be exercised if
the operator is to expect them to perform when needed. Like any internal combustion engine,
periodic replacement of fluids, filters, belts, and hoses are essential to reliability. Areas of particular
concern include:
 Start Battery: The primary cause for standby generator failure is a dead start battery.
Routine generator exercise runs will identify the vast majority of start battery issues.
Proper selection of a start battery and battery charger is also critical. Money spent on a
reliable, properly sized start battery and charger from a reputable manufacturer is money
well spent. Some start batteries can self-discharge when left on open circuit (uncharged) or
in storage. Be sure to follow manufacturer’s recommended freshening charge interval. If
not followed, the batteries can suffer permanent loss of capacity.
 Fuel System: The #2 cause for standby generator failure is lack of fuel. Root causes include
a clogged fuel filter, fuel pump failure, water in the fuel tank, and a fuel piping valve left in
the closed position. A common root cause for clogged fuel filter is diesel fuel degradation
35The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
caused by failure to consume the fuel in a timely manner. Properly sized fuel tanks (not too
small, not too large) are an important consideration. Again, routine generator exercise will
identify the vast majority of these issues, and ensure fuel will be consumed and not degrade.
Annual filtering of fuel, typically using a tighter micron filter, can be beneficial, particularly
in high humidity areas.
 ATS: A common flaw during routine engine runs is failure to operate the generator under
load and thus test the transfer of power to the standby source (i.e., failure to test the
function of the ATS). A routine engine run without placing the engine under load 1) is
harmful to the diesel engine, leading to a condition called “wet stacking”, 2) fails to verify
that the ATS is performing correctly, 3) fails to verify alternator function, and 4) fails to
verify if the generator is still capable of supporting the connected load. Testing the ATS is
more complicated in a shared standby power arrangement that utilizes multiple ATS (one
per carrier). ATS systems should be set to perform “loaded exercise” cycles.
While critical to maintaining the reliability of the standby power system, these issues are common with any
standby power system, shared or dedicated. The Focus Team has reviewed the existing standby AC
maintenance Best Practices and found them to be adequate.
5.8.1 MANAGING CARRIER MAINTENANCE AND AC ELECTRICAL WORK
When a carrier sends an electrician to the shared generator site to perform work that may affect the
generator or other carriers, the generator owner needs to be informed. Changes to the electrical
infrastructure must be communicated and approved to ensure it does not impact other carriers or the
shared generator. Conversely, if the generator owner is performing maintenance on the generator or
changes to the electrical infrastructure, then the affected carriers must be informed. A Method of
Procedure (MOP) to inform the other parties of any maintenance or electrical infrastructure changes
must be part of a shared generator agreement.
6 PORTABLE GENERATORS AND FUEL SHARING
6.1 SCOPE
This portion of the report will address the Shared Resources Subcommittee’s findings in regards to
the implementation and utilization of a shared resource model including, but not limited, to:
1. How wireless carriers can approach the sharing of resources such as portable generators,
fuel, and other assets.
2. Networks and resources (FEMA, the military, U.S. Government) carriers could utilize to fulfill
their primary purposes of asset and resource coordination.
3. What can be learned from the Electric Power Industry’s Mutual Assistance Network and how
carriers can utilize their methods and processes within the wireless industry.
4. How a shared resources network would assist carriers in gaining priority access to fuel
terminals and other resources.
36The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
5. Current and new best practices in regards to small cells, portable generators, bulk fuel efforts,
etc.
6. The draft of an internal and external resource communications matrix to be utilized in the
collecting of mutual interests and resources prior to and during a major disaster event.
6.2 OVERVIEW
Historically, carriers have each responded independently during disaster recovery and restoration
efforts. In recent years, disasters have proven to be a challenge due to a greater reliance upon
cellular communications. Carriers have used company owned assets or have outsourced portable
generator fleets, fueling, and other resources during these times. More recently, carriers have
explored various methods of sharing generator assets but have yet to find a solution that is cost
effective and reliable.
The resource focus group has examined the current means of sharing resources and recommend a set
of best practices that providers could use to more efficiently apply asset and resource sharing
methods to sustain networks in future events. The purpose was to identify best practices for sharing
portable resources around asset transportation, access to fuel (priority at terminals), sharing
refueling drivers, common staging locations for generators, and shared driver, truck, and trailer pools
for technicians and equipment delivery to sites. These practices do not, of course, replace the need for
individual carriers to adequately invest in the resiliency of their own networks and their service
restoration practices and capabilities.
6.3 APPROACH
Beginning with the desired end result in mind, we start with ways to create greater efficiencies at the
sites concerning the following:
 Stationary and portable shared generators
 One fuel type utilized at each site if shared generators are not an option.
 Utilization of one fuel delivery driver regardless of how many carriers are at the site.
 Shared portable generator fleets.
 Shared staging facilities.
Having a shared generator with one fuel source will create an opportunity to streamline restoration
services and create a more cost effective approach to recovery efforts.
 The supply and delivery of one fuel type as opposed to several fuel types, eliminates the need
for multiple suppliers. Example: 2 diesel generators, 1 unleaded gasoline and 1 propane
equals 4 suppliers, 3 fuel types
 More cost effective and safer, and eliminates some of the environmental concerns created by
multiple suppliers responding to each site.
 One fuel delivery driver is more cost effective and creates efficiency.
o Four carriers at a site requiring four fuel deliveries by four different suppliers, results
in increased expense and inefficiency.
 One generator with a significantly larger fuel supply to extend run time.
o To eliminate some of the environmental concerns with having a larger quantity of fuel
onsite. Utilization of multiple diesel tanks to create a larger supply as opposed to one
larger tank will greatly reduce the impact should a spill occur. For example: three, 200
37The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
gallon tanks with a gravity or pressure feed instead of one, 600 gallon tank reduces
the exposure should the tank be damaged causing a leak. If a leak does occur it will
only release what is in the individual tank. NFPA codes can be met with a fire proof
plate being placed between each tank onsite. Fuel should not be stored inside the
shelter.
 Sharing a portable solution would save on the transportation, deployment, maintenance,
staging facility, and fuel delivery cost for all involved.
6.4 SHARED RESOURCES
6.4.1 SHARING OF REFUELING RESOURCES
During a large disaster, hundreds-if not thousands of portable and stationary generators are
providing power to cell sites. Each of these generators needs to be fueled approximately every 48
hours. Typically, each carrier is utilizing their own set of refueling resources. These are dedicated
refueling trucks delivering fuel into the carrier’s own generators. This is inefficient, ineffective, and
much more expensive for the carriers than sharing refueling trucks and drivers. The refueling
vendors are dedicated to each carrier and charge them a per hour fee for each resource deployed.
This cost quickly adds up as refueling drivers are standing by waiting for dispatch or sitting in traffic.
Additionally, travel costs are absorbed by each carrier for every resource deployed.
During Super Storm Sandy the most significant damage and lingering outages were within a 50-mile
radius of New York City. Nearly 18 million people live inside that same 50-mile circle. By
comparison, About 18.5 million people live in the entire state of Florida. Consider the
conditions that would occur if you were to put every person who lives in Florida, and their entire
wireless infrastructure, inside a 50-mile circle. Then turn off all traffic control devices, pile debris on
the roads from wind and storm surge, and leave most of the people and their vehicles in place as
opposed to mass evacuation. This was the environment the carriers and their fuel service providers
were operating in following Super Storm Sandy. There were urban market challenges with refueling
given inoperable traffic lights and mass congestion on the roads. By each carrier having dozens of
dedicated refueling trucks and drivers, it only added to the frustration, congestion, and bottlenecks at
the cell sites.
If carriers were to pool refueling resources together and ‘pay by the refuel’ it would be much more
effective and efficient. Not only would there be fewer vehicles on the road, there would also be less
congestion at the cell sites as well. If a refueling vendor showed up to a cell site, they could top off
two to three generators vs. refueling just one and leaving. This approach would also ease the
operating expense burden put on the carriers during a disaster refueling.
This does present challenges however, because the fueling vehicles typically carrying <1,000 gallons
of fuel. This means that they would only be able to hit one site before having to re-supply their vehicle
to make another refuel run.
6.4.2 STAGING FACILITIES
Historically, carriers have utilized internal resources and locations for staging of portable generators
or fuel. Depending on the magnitude of the disaster it is not always logistically feasible to find these
38The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
locations. In other cases it may be due to space constraints or damage to the carrier’s facility. The
following matrix is being provided in order to streamline the process of procuring a location in the
midst of recovery efforts already underway.
Staging Yard Contacts – Appendix C
The list being provided consists of transportation and logistics companies. These companies are
capable of providing an all-in-one solution. The all-in-one-solution includes, but is not limited, to:
 Indoor Warehousing
 Outdoor Warehousing
 Secure Paved Yards
 Forklifts
 Labor
 Cranes or Boom Trucks
 Temporary Office Facilities
 Loading and Unloading Labor (Crane)
 Dock Access (Warehouse)
 Generator Deployment
 Diesel Mechanics (Portable Generator Repair and Maintenance)
 Inventory Management
 Spill Containment
6.4.3 BULK FUEL RESOURCES
It is recommended that Bulk Fuel be kept in transports in order to maintain mobility. This allows the
sharing of fuel should one carrier have the availability of releasing unused gallons and another carrier
have the need.
Maintaining the mobility will allow employees accessibility during recovery efforts due to lack of fuel
resources. Mobile fueling stations can be shared by the carriers and should be considered for future
storms. Mobile fueling stations provide carrier employees access to fuel at strategic locations that
enable continued recovery efforts.
Carriers who use off road or dyed diesel should consider removing this requirement for off road
diesel (dyed) during disaster recovery efforts. This will alleviate procurement constraints when
trying to locate fuel resources. It will also allow for the fuel to be used by company vehicles along
with generators. The use of off road diesel is not a requirement for standby generators.

39The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
6.4.4 WIRELESS MUTUAL ASSISTANCE NETWORKS
The sharing of resources and assets between providers is a seemingly new concept within the
wireless industry. However, it has proven to be an effective solution for restoration efforts within the
Electric Power and Energy industry for years. The Mutual Assistance Network is a voluntary
partnership of electric utilities across the country. These partnerships, managed by smaller groups
divided into regions (Regional Mutual Assistance Groups or RMAGS), are committed to helping
restore power whenever and wherever assistance is needed. Created decades ago, the Mutual
Assistance Network provides a formal yet flexible process for utilities to request support from other
utilities in parts of the country that have not been affected by the major weather event. Partnerships
in the mutual assistance network are based upon voluntary agreements between electric utilities
within the region. When a utility determines that it needs restoration assistance, it initiates a request
through an RMAG. Once a request has been made, the RMAG facilitates the process of identifying
available crews and resources and helps utilities coordinate the logistics and personnel involved in
restoration efforts.
It is proposed that the wireless industry could potentially initiate a program and process similar to
that of the Electric and Power Industry’s Mutual Assistance Network, or alternatively to approach
them with an opportunity to merge effort to strengthen and utilize their current voluntary network.
By that same token, the procedures and protocols developed in any such program should ensure that
individual carriers’ incentives to invest in their own service restoration and network resiliency
resources are not undermined. Alternatively, the carriers could take advantage of an existing entity
such as the US Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) National Coordinating Center for
Communications (NCC), to which most of the major carriers already belong.
The benefits of a Mutual Aid Network established in the wireless industry would most likely mirror
that of the Electric Power industry. This includes a quicker network restoration time, a “strength in
numbers” effect that could enable requesting parties to obtain benefits such as priority access to fuel
terminals, more options for staging areas, good public relations, and an overall positive affect on the
recovery of multiple networks instead of a staggering recovery of several separate networks.
6.4.5 EMERGENCY POWER FACILITY ASSESSMENT TOOL (EPFAT)
Following a Presidential Disaster Declaration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is often
called upon by FEMA to assist in providing temporary emergency power at critical public facilities
identified by state officials. If the power to critical communications facilities is disrupted, FEMA
assistance in restoring power to these facilities may be requested by the State as a part of a
coordinated restoration strategy developed in conjunction with telecommunications providers. In
order to facilitate this restoration, facility emergency power assessment data is required before a
generator can be sourced and installed.
EPFAT is a secure web-based tool that can be used by critical public facility owners/operators or
emergency response agencies, to input, store, update, and/or view temporary emergency power
assessment data. Having pre-installation assessment data in advance will expedite USACE’s abilities
to provide temporary power.
40The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
Background:
 EPFAT was developed by USACE and FEMA to expedite the installation of generators following
major disasters.
 Following a disaster, it can take the USACE many hours, and possibly days, to deploy
assessment teams to all of the impacted critical public facilities so that the right generators can
be properly installed.
 By adding information to EPFAT prior to a disaster, USACE will have the assessment data and
generator size requirements needed to expedite the installation process.
 The database also provides the facility manager and the local/state/federal Emergency
Management staff a permanent off-site repository for this information which is password
protected and under controlled access.

6.5 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SHARING RESOURCES
The following recommendations regarding sharing resources are not meant to be classified as best
practices, but rather, considerations that the FCC should share with NIST and other working groups
engaged in similar work.
 Network Operators and Service Providers could determine the status of existing generator(s) in
use by others and examine the potential for resource sharing before committing to a generator
installation.
 Property Managers at multi-carrier sites could manage generator installations at the site
including timing of installations and power sharing.
 Network Operators, Service Providers, and Property Managers could pursue backup power plans
that add value to the overall business plan of the companies.
 Network Operators and Service Providers could collaborate in identifying opportunities and risks
in choosing shared backup power sites and select locations that will provide the most value.
41The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
 Network Operators and Service Providers could, on a national and regional basis, hold meetings
to discuss shared backup power opportunities on annual or more frequent basis.
 Network Operators, Service Providers, and Property Managers could ensure that backup power
resource providers utilize a fleet of generators that are sized to handle the power needs of
multiple carriers.
 Network Operators, Service Providers, and Property Managers could mutually plan beforehand
with refueling companies to share refueling resources including post disaster coordination to
share refueling resources and costs.
 Network Operators, Service Providers, and Property Managers could collaborate in establishing
liaisons with emergency management recovery operations as part of the recovery process.
 Network Operators, Service Providers, and Property Managers could liaison with government
emergency management in developing and exercising disaster recovery plans to include power
resources.
7 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
The following recommendations regarding sharing resources are not meant to be classified as best
practices, but rather, considerations that the FCC should share with NIST and other working groups
engaged in similar work.
During an emergency situation, a stationary or portable backup resource may be shared by the
operators on a telecommunications site. Several aspects of this shared resource must be addressed
prior to its implementation. Please note that these items are intended to guide and streamline the
sharing process:
A. Ownership – Who owns the equipment? This is true for both stationary and portable
installations. Ownership drives the responsibility for costs and adherence to codes and
regulations, maintenance, and overall communications planning.
B. Location of Equipment – If it is temporary equipment, what is the proper location? Locations
must be coordinated prior to the emergency. It should consider trailer access, re-fueling
requirements, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC), power connection
requirements, and ensure exhaust is not directed towards facility outside air (economizer)
intakes.
C. Who will install the equipment, turn up and connect to the various operators’ equipment?
Development of a deployment plan is vital to an efficient operation for power restoration.
D. Who will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the equipment? This is a
contractual issue which may include designated maintenance schedules, fuel polishing,
system exercising, re-fueling during emergencies, air quality requirement adherence, SPCCs,
and likely performance requirements.
E. Who will be responsible for meeting the regulatory requirement for the equipment? This
would include monitoring hours of operation, any fuel spillage issues, and associated cleanup.
42The Communications, Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group IX
Power Sub-Committee November 7, 2014
F. Who will be responsible for refueling the equipment? Ensure this is designated upfront
before an emergency arises. It may include contracts with fueling vendors. Monitoring of fuel
levels is a key as runtime can vary greatly dependent on load. This can be a region wide
outage which means multiple sites will be affected and a designated plan should include all
sites.
G. How will the total cost of the backup resource be shared between the operators?
H. If it a temporary equipment, who will be responsible for its removal after use in the
emergency situation?
I. Develop a communications plan. Dealing with a single site is fairly straight forward but a
wide spread outage will be a challenge if a clear line of communication is not created. Include
contacts along with secondary contacts. Keep the list to a minimum in order to keep it
efficient. The communication plan should consider pre-event planning (for hurricane type
events), during event planning, and post-event planning. The communications plan must be
reevaluated on a revolving basis to ensure that the contacts are current.2
8 SUMMARY
To recapitulate, the CSRIC Working Group 9 Backup Power Subcommittee was divided into four focus
groups with the end goal of providing recommendations to increase the resiliency and reliability of
the telecommunications infrastructure.
This document, the output of Working Group 9 Backup Power Subcommittee, was developed through
the combined effort of a multi-stakeholder community involving industry as well as public sector
representatives and agencies. The collaboration and efforts of this multi-stakeholder community has
provided substantive material for consideration. It is the recommendation of this working group that
the FCC share the output of this document with NIST and other similar working groups who are
working towards the common goal of infrastructure resiliency.
