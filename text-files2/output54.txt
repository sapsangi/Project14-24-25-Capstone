1.1 Executive Summary
Current FCC location accuracy requirements under the Commission’s rules Section 20.18(h)
allow Commercial Mobile Radio Service (“CMRS”) providers using a network-based E9-1-1
location method to begin “blending” their GPS handset-based location data with their network-
based data at the different benchmarks between January 2012 and January 2019. Based on
recommendations made in the CSRIC III WG3 March 2012 Report concerning certain key
performance indicators (KPIs) and the different types of empirical testing, CSRIC IV Working
Group 1 was charged to examine whether those recommendations still apply for network-based
carriers reconfiguring to Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”) platforms. WG1 examined current testing
recommendations as they apply to wireless carriers transitioning to Long Term Evolution
(“LTE”) with respect to meeting current location accuracy parameters in 20.18.
This report documents the examination by CSRIC IV Working Group 1 Subgroup 2 with respect
to the following:
1. The impact VoLTE implementation will have on carriers’ ability to comply with existing
wireless E9-1-1 location accuracy levels.
2. Carriers transitioning from second generation (“2G”)/third generation (“3G”) networks
to VoLTE networks generating and delivering location information to Public Safety
Answering Points (“PSAPs”) during the period when they are operating both legacy and
VoLTE networks. Additionally, the impact, if any, that simultaneous operation of both
networks during the transition will have on carriers’ overall wireless location accuracy
performance.
The conclusions drawn from this report are:
1. The FCC should expect, over time, location performance with VoLTE to be slightly
better than or equivalent to 2G and 3G performance.
2. It is not anticipated that modifications to existing carrier testing methods or procedures
would be required due to the introduction of VoLTE. The FCC should continue to
support the recommendations of CSRIC III WG3. In summary, those are:
• Key performance indicators (KPIs) should be routinely monitored to help identify
instances where system performance has degraded (relative to baseline compliance
tests) and further testing and system improvements are needed at the local level.
• Enhancements to location technology should be validated in representative
environments, to ensure equivalent or improved performance. An example of this
would be the introduction of OTDOA for VoLTE.
• Spot-checking using empirical field-testing should be conducted on an as needed
basis, for example, as determined by KPI monitoring or legitimate performance
concerns from a PSAP.
• Empirical data for maintenance testing may be collected incrementally over time.
• Any significant deviations from expected prior performance levels should result in
careful investigation and re-testing of the applicable test area.
Page 3 of 19The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group 1
Final Report September, 2014
• These alternative maintenance testing methods replace the need for full compliance
testing every two years.
• All legitimate performance inquiries from a County/PSAP or other public safety
entity shall be properly investigated with full cooperation from the wireless service
provider, and any issues resolved in a timely manner.
2 Introduction
The Commission directed CSRIC IV WG 1 to examine the impact of the migration to enabled
4G VoLTE networks on the ability of carriers to meet with the Commission’s accuracy levels
for wireless Enhanced 9-1-1 (“E9-1-1”) Phase II location information for CMRS providers. The
record in the FCC’s E9-1-1 Location Accuracy proceeding and the CSRIC III WG 3 2012 and
2013 Reports indicate that location technology vendors are making enhancements to the location
technologies that will be used by carriers in 4G VoLTE networks.

3 Objective, Scope, and Methodology
3.1 Objective
Previous CSRIC groups have explored accuracy and testing of the Global System for Mobile
Communication (“GSM” or 2G), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (“UMTS” or
3G), and 3rd Generation Code Division Multiple Access (“CDMA”) or IS-2000 deployments
(also included in the term 3G in this document) in relation to requirements for wireless E9-1-1.
The LTE or fourth generation “4G” technology has now reached the point in the specification
Page 5 of 19The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group 1
Final Report September, 2014
development process to allow for an evaluation by CSRIC. That said, The FCC provided
several tasks to Working Group 1. The membership for Task 2 is charged with questions
concerning several aspects of location estimation for VoLTE”, including accuracy, latency and
testing. The focus of this report is not FCC rule compliance per se but VoLTE’s potential E9-1-
1 location accuracy performance and the usefulness of applying existing location accuracy
testing policies and procedures to 9-1-1 calls from 4G VoLTE networks.
The task team members have formed responses to the specific questions posed by the FCC in the
clarified task description as follows:
1. What impact will VoLTE implementation have on carriers’ ability to comply with
existing wireless E9-1-1 location accuracy requirements?
a. How will the technologies used for generation and delivery of wireless E9-1-1
location information differ for VoLTE from those used for generation and delivery of
wireless E9-1-1 location information in legacy 2G/3G networks?
b. Can VoLTE provide location accuracy that meets the Commission’s current rules
and benchmarks for wireless E9-1-1 location accuracy?
i. Can VoLTE networks and the location technologies that will be used in
such networks achieve increases in location accuracy and yield and decreases in
latency compared to 2G and 3G networks?
ii. Are all VoLTE deployments the same in terms of their ability to support
wireless E9-1-1 location determination? Can the Commission expect the same
level of location accuracy performance across networks deploying VoLTE or will
carrier performance differ?
2. How will carriers transitioning from 2G/3G networks to VoLTE networks generate and
deliver location information to PSAPs during the period when they are operating both legacy
and VoLTE networks? What impact, if any, will simultaneous operation of both networks
during the transition have on carriers’ overall location accuracy performance?
a. Does the transition to VoLTE require any modifications to current carrier testing
procedures for determining compliance with the Commission’s location accuracy
requirements under Section 20.18?
b. Should prior CSRIC recommendations regarding location testing (e.g., CSRIC III
WG 3 recommendations regarding testing by network-based carriers every two years)
apply to carriers reconfiguring to VoLTE platforms?
The format of the document directly follows those questions.

4 Location Accuracy in VoLTE Networks
4.1 What impact will VoLTE implementation have on carriers’ ability to
comply with existing E9-1-1 location accuracy requirements?
While the network elements and protocols used in VoLTE may differ from 2G and 3G location
architectures, the equivalent location capabilities are provided. Thus, the high level conclusion
is that VoLTE will have no deleterious impact on the ability of operators to meet the E9-1-1
location accuracy levels that currently apply to CMRS.
4.1.1 How will the technologies used for generation and delivery of E9-1-1 location
information differ for VoLTE from those used for generations and delivery of E9-1-
1 location information in legacy 2G/3G networks?
Generation of the location information uses very similar components and technologies in both
2G/3G and 4G networks. The two diagrams in Figure 1 and Figure 2 below show the major
components of a 2G/3G system and a 4G system.
The same location technologies can be supported in all generations (2G/3G/4G). Assisted
Global Positioning System (“A-GPS”) in 3G has been extended to Assisted Global Navigation
Satellite System (“A-GNSS”) with the addition of new constellations, such as Global Navigation
Satellite System (“GLONASS”) in 4G LTE systems. Handset-measured ranging signals are
employed in Advanced Forward Link Trilateration (“AFLT”) in 3G CDMA systems and
Observed Time Difference of Arrival (“OTDOA”) systems in 4G LTE systems. Network-
measured ranging signals are used in Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (“UTDOA”) in both
2G/3G and 4G systems.
The content of the Phase II location estimate delivered to the PSAP out of a VoLTE 4G network
includes the same position, confidence, and uncertainty parameters used in 2G/3G networks for
technologies that directly generate geographic (i.e., XY) location. These will be formatted
appropriately for legacy PSAPs as well as NG9-1-1PSAPs.
Delivery of the Phase I cell site civic address will continue to be delivered in the same textual
format as in 2G/3G systems. Small cells deployed indoors will provide better Phase I location
accuracy than outdoor macro cells. The deployment of small cells is not limited to VoLTE, but
is a general trend to provide geographical re-use of limited spectrum.

Final Report September, 2014
In both 2G/3G and 4G systems, the voice portion of the call is handled separately from the
location determination function.
In Figure 2 above, the voice is routed to the PSAP through a gateway. The position calculation
process consists of a sequence of data packets between the handset or user equipment (UE) and
the network position calculation function. The data packets can be carried over the control
channel or the user data channel. The modules involved in the two different paths are listed
below.
The voice path for an E9-1-1 VoLTE call goes from
UEeNBS/PGWsCSCFsMGCFE9-1-1->ES Network->Legacy PSAP for the call to
connect.
Phase II Location via control channel is:
E9-1-1 LBS Control Plane goes from PSAPLRFGMLCMMEE-SMLCUE then back
to PSAP through the ES Network
Phase II Location via the user data channel is:
E9-1-1 LBS User Plane goes from PSAPLRFGMLCESLPUE then back to PSAP via
the ES Network
4.2 Can VoLTE provide location accuracy that meets the Commission’s
current rules and benchmarks for E9-1-1 location accuracy?
As discussed below, LTE-based location methods provide more flexibility, and in some cases
better accuracy is expected relative to current 2G/3G-based methods. Since 2G/3G-based
technologies are now compliant with the current FCC Phase II mandates for CMRS providers,
VoLTE-based location is expected to meet the accuracy levels of the current CMRS outdoor
location Phase II requirements for E9-1-1.
4.2.1 Can VoLTE networks and the location technologies that will be used in such
networks achieve increases in location accuracy and yield and decreases in latency
compared to 2G and 3G networks?
The statements below are based on an architectural analysis and system simulations of LTE
location capabilities, as compared to 2G and 3G. The actual performance improvements will
ultimately be characterized in carrier outdoor testing and future indoor test beds recommended
by CSRIC.
The following statements can be made about VoLTE-based location performance using each of
the location technologies below, which are already committed for VoLTE deployments:
4.2.1.1 A-GPS/A-GNSS
LTE is not expected to significantly improve Time to First Fix (“TTFF”) as compared to 2G/3G.
This is because the TTFF will be dominated by GNSS location determination time. Observed
Page 9 of 19The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group 1
Final Report September, 2014
location determination fix-type ratios based on carrier-provided E9-1-1 data logs are
predominantly A-GPS, though a minority will fall back to a network-based location technology.
The A-GPS TTFF is in the 8 to 24 second range, and this will not be appreciably shortened by
the faster networks for message delivery. Fallback methods typically have shorter TTFF, but are
typically less accurate than A-GPS.
A-GPS yield, accuracy and TTFF may modestly improve in synchronous LTE networks2 as
compared to asynchronous GSM/UMTS networks, since the finer time accuracy (1.5 – 5 uSec)3
speeds the acquisition of the GPS signals. This effect will be most pronounced in weak signal
environments such as indoors.4 LTE time synchronization is comparable to CDMA, so little
improvement is expected compared to CDMA. Some UMTS networks have been synchronized
as part of network upgrades and would exhibit similarly small A-GPS improvements.
A-GNSS (e.g., GPS & GLONASS) is expected to roll out concomitantly with LTE, which will
allow more satellite vehicles to be used in the location calculations. Published articles 5 show
that this will lead to somewhat higher accuracy, lower TTFF, and increased yield, especially in
dense urban scenarios. GSM and CDMA did not support GLONASS; while UMTS had modest
support for GLONASS, LTE handsets are expected to widely support GLONASS and eventually
other satellite constellations such as BeiDou6 and Galileo7 may be supported, as well.
4.2.1.2 OTDOA
LTE OTDOA is expected to give improved performance (accuracy and yield) compared to
CDMA AFLT for multiple reasons:
1) Wider signal bandwidths allow more precise estimate of Time of Arrival.
2) The OTDOA positioning reference signal is isolated in the code, time and frequency
domain,
3) The protocol has finer time/distance reporting precision for distances less than 40km.
2 In a Synchronous LTE or UMTS Network, GPS is used to align the signals coming from the
base stations (e.g., eNBs) with timing derived from the GPS system. In an asynchronous LTE,
UMTS, or other type of network, the timing of the base station signals is unrelated to GPS
resulting in a slower GPS TTFF, as discussed further in footnote 4.

Telecom Requirements for Time and Frequency Synchronization
Marc Weiss, Ph.D. Time and Frequency Division, NIST
4 While the exact details of how network time synchronization improves GPS acquisition are
beyond the scope of this report, the topic is well-discussed in Understanding GPS Principles and
Applications, 2nd edition ISBN-13: 978-1-58053-894-7, especially pp. 535-543. Basically,
precise network time availability reduces the GPS acquisition code phase “search space”. In a
weak signal environment, the time to analyze each “code phase/frequency” search bin is
increased due to the need for longer non-coherent integration time. As a result, the benefit of
precise network time availability has the most acquisition time benefit in a weak signal
environment, and can make the difference between obtaining a GPS fix in 30 seconds or not.”

Accuracy may be improved because LTE supports more flexible hybrid positioning methods
than 2G/3G. The E-SMLC can initiate multiple location methods at once, such as an OTDOA
location performed in the network, and UE-based A-GNSS calculated in the UE.8
4.2.1.3 Small Cell
Small cell deployments are more likely to happen in LTE, due to spectrum allocations in the 3.5
GHz band and rapid increases in wireless data consumption. This could lead to a more accurate
Phase I location for small cells with small coverage areas, which in some cases may be accurate
enough for first responder dispatching. In these cases, a more accurate Phase I location may also
improve A-GNSS acquisition for weak signal scenarios.
4.2.1.4 Overall impact and validation of LTE-related location enhancements
Carrier outdoor testing and future indoor test beds recommended by CSRIC will ultimately
determine the benefit of all of these changes, and produce real data to validate the expectations
stated above.
4.2.2 Are all VoLTE deployments the same in terms of their ability to support E9-1-1
location determination? Can the Commission expect the same level of location
accuracy performance across networks deploying VoLTE or will carrier
performance differ?
Given that all carriers are converging on the same radio access network technology, namely
LTE, and that carriers have announced plans to implement the same location technologies to
locate VoLTE calls to 9-1-1, location performance for VoLTE in comparable topologies is
generally expected to be quite similar across different carrier networks.
While there are implementation details that can affect location performance from carrier to
carrier, it is expected that carriers will follow similar paths to optimize LTE location
functionality.

Final Report September, 2014
Different wireless carriers will utilize a variety of vendors to supply needed location
functionality in both networks and handsets. Since any deployed location technology will be
standardized, different vendor implementations are not expected to result in significant
differences in location performance, assuming similar field conditions and deployment
parameters.
These expectations for similar performance across various carrier/vendor implementations have
been demonstrated through practical experience with A-GPS – where different carriers have
obtained similar yield and accuracy figures – even with different network and handset
implementation parameters.
Specific location technologies currently planned and announced for use for VoLTE E9-1-1
include:
• A-GPS
• A-GLONASS
• OTDOA
A-GPS and A-GLONASS (collectively A-GNSS) are expected to perform similarly across
different carrier and vendor VoLTE implementations, just as A-GPS has for previously deployed
radio access networks.
OTDOA, while fully standardized, allows various options that can affect location performance.
For example, Positioning Reference Signals (“PRS”) can be transmitted on the downlink at
different duty cycles and durations. PRS muting increases “hearability” between adjacent
towers, by only one tower transmitting at a specific time in a given area. PRS muting patterns
can be optimized to specific geographies (e.g., urban canyons versus rural). Actual field data
collected over many months, with different traffic volumes and tower spacing in rural versus
dense urban cores will go into the continuous improvement process by the carriers. In dense cell
spacing, increasing the number of towers heard will increase the number of directions from
which data is collected. This is expected to improve accuracy. TTFF should not change
significantly.
It is reasonable to expect that carriers and their vendors will work carefully to ensure these
location technologies are optimized and implemented properly relative to E9-1-1 location
performance. Furthermore, these implementation options can be adjusted and adapted, as
needed over time, to address any specific performance gaps for a given carrier.
Given these considerations, it is reasonable for the Commission to generally expect the same
level of location performance across various carrier networks deploying VoLTE.
4.2.3 Location Technologies that could potentially be deployed for VoLTE
The discussion in the following sections covers location technologies that could potentially
augment location performance, but are not currently committed for VoLTE implementations in
the US. These technologies have either (a) already been deployed in 2G or 3G networks, or (b)
used for cLBS applications, or (c) are in an advanced state of prototyping and validation.
Page 12 of 19The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council IV Working Group 1
Final Report September, 2014
Additionally, other technologies discussed in the CSRIC III report, “Leveraging LBS and
Emerging Location Technologies for Indoor Wireless E9-1-1 (Mar. 14, 2013)”9, may eventually
be considered for enhancement of VoLTE location.
4.2.3.1 UTDOA
Location accuracy of UTDOA deployed on LTE networks should comparable to, or better than,
the accuracy achieved by UTDOA deployed on 3G or 2G networks, and location latency for
UTDOA deployed on 4G (LTE) networks should be similar to that achieved for UTDOA
deployed on 2G (GSM) networks, depending on the assigned periodicity and bandwidth of the
Sounding Reference Signal (“SRS”) configuration10.
4.2.3.2 Wi-Fi
In addition to the committed LTE location methods discussed above, other location methods
such as Wi-Fi for VoLTE have been standardized. Wi-Fi for position calculation has been
standardized in Secure User Plane (“SUPL”) 2.0 and is available for deployment on GSM,
UMTS, CDMA and LTE. SUPL Multiple Location IDs support reporting of Medium Access
Control (“MAC”) Address for unique user identification latitude and longitude lookup, signal
strength for Received Signal Strength Indicator (“RSSI”) position calculation and round trip
delay for RTT position calculation. These are only available in UE-Assisted user plane call
flows where the position is calculated by the E-SMLC in the network.11
Wi-Fi support for control plane UE-Assisted call flows is standardized only for LTE in the LPPe
protocol12. LTE control plane LPP protocol can be extended with the External Protocol Data
Unit (“EPDU”), to support LPPe protocol to transmit the same Wi-Fi parameters available in
SUPL Multiple Location IDs (Mac Address, signal strength, round trip delay).13
Wi-Fi measurements could be reported along with OTDOA and A-GNSS measurements. The
combination of multiple sources of information can be used to cross-validate the other systems.
4.2.3.3 Terrestrial Beacon System (TBS)
Terrestrial Beacon Systems are one of the newer positioning techniques that are under
consideration to augment the existing positioning methods. Similar to GPS, the system is air
interface agnostic. The performance of NextNav’s Rev 1 implementation of TBS was
benchmarked during CSRIC III, and the Rev 2 implementation was tested under similar
conditions (not under CSRIC oversight) 14. This technology is currently in the process of being

4.2.3.4 Hybrid positioning systems
Each positioning system can operate in isolation or in combination with other systems. A-GNSS
is one example of hybrid combining of measurements from two different positioning systems
(e.g., GPS + GLONASS, or GPS+BEIDOU). This is an example of a tightly coupled hybrid
combination in the measurement space. A second kind of hybrid combination is a loosely
coupled, cross checking of results between cell tower computed positions, e.g. via OTDOA and
Wi-Fi computed positions.
Multiple combinations of different technologies can be combined together to produce a more
reliable and accurate position estimate than any one system alone. GPS works well in outdoor
environments, but has limitations in some indoor environments. Other location methods can fill
in the gaps, each with different strengths and weaknesses.

5 Transition from 2G/3G to VoLTE
5.1 How will carriers transitioning from 2G/3G networks to VoLTE
networks generate and deliver location information to PSAPs during the
period when they are operating both legacy and VoLTE networks?
What impact, if any, will simultaneous operation of both networks
during the transition have on carriers’ overall location accuracy
performance?
The scope of these questions is specifically referring to carrier-deployed VoLTE for an LTE
Radio Access Network (“RAN”), using an IMS Core Network (“CN”) for the transport of
VoLTE calls across the network. Note that, Multimedia Messaging Emergency Services
(“MMES”) and Rich Communications Services (“RCS”) are out of scope.
The expectation is that initial location accuracy will be as good, if not better, compared to legacy
2G/3G networks. Performance improvements over time are expected as the location
technologies in 4G are optimized.
Carriers will do what makes the most sense to support customer expectations regarding
emergency support and the availability of wireless E9-1-1 Phase II location accuracy on the 4G
network. It is likely that carriers will leverage the underlying 2G/3G networks for E9-1-1
support wherever possible until 4G networks and associated location technologies are fully
deployed and optimized and 2G/3G networks are decommissioned. It is expected that in the
early stages of 4G network deployments, carriers will be deploying E9-1-1 location technologies
that are similar to current solutions available on their 2G/3G networks; namely, A-GPS
supplemented by a network-based location technology for areas where GPS is challenged.
Without knowing each specific carrier’s network implementation and transition plans, it is
unlikely that the operations of one network (2G/3G) will impact the operations of the other
network (4G) as they are separate network architectures. However, some of the E9-1-1 Phase II
location technologies being deployed on 4G networks (e.g. OTDOA) are new and are only now
in their initial deployment by some carriers being implemented on completely new network
infrastructures. As with E9-1-1 Phase II on 2G/3G networks, it will take some time to optimize
the key attributes of the location technologies for 4G. Some examples of network tuning during
this transitional period are:
1. Cell Tower location provisioning
2. RF parameters for mutual cell hearability to maximize the number of towers measured
by the UE
3. Degree of synchronization.

5.1.1 Does the transition to VoLTE require any modifications to current carrier testing
procedures for determining compliance to the Commission’s location accuracy
requirements under Section 20.18?
The transition to VoLTE should not require any modifications to current carrier testing
procedures. It is the evolution of the E9-1-1 location determination platform that would affect
outdoor carrier-testing procedures as new location technologies are incorporated into 4G
networks. Where the same location technologies are used, current carrier testing procedures
should not change, but new location technologies may require different testing methods.
With the proliferation of indoor small cells and other indoor-specific technologies, testing in a
set of representative environments (e.g., a common indoor test bed), should be sufficient.
Before location accuracy testing occurs, the 4G networks with their associated location
technology should be allowed to fully deploy across the network and allow for the carriers to
monitor the technology and its day-to-day performance on a fully operational commercial
network.
5.1.2 Should prior CSRIC recommendations regarding location testing (e.g., CSRIC III
WG3 recommendations regarding testing by network-based carriers every two
years) apply to carriers reconfiguring to VoLTE platforms?
CSRIC III WG3 produced reports on both outdoor and indoor wireless location performance and
testing. Those recommendations continue to be applicable as carriers reconfigure to VoLTE.
Where the underlying location technology is the same as previously used for compliance testing
(e.g., A-GPS) and no significant changes to field conditions or deployment options have
occurred, there is no need to repeat county-level compliance testing for a change in radio access
network (e.g., the introduction of VoLTE). As suggested by CSRIC III WG3, once outdoor
county-level compliance has been certified to meet accuracy requirements, a systematic method
of ‘spot-checking’ representative areas that have previously been tested and shown compliant
can be employed to verify that changes (such as a different radio access network) have not
resulted in any significant deviations from expected performance levels.
CSRIC III WG3 “Final Report – Outdoor Location Accuracy” (14 March 2012) section 5.4.2
“Proposed Maintenance Approach” remains the recommended approach, including for carriers
reconfiguring to VoLTE platforms. Note that this CSRIC III recommendation does not include
automatic re-testing by network-based carriers every two years.

6 Conclusions
It is not anticipated that modifications to existing outdoor carrier testing methods or procedures
would be required due to the introduction of VoLTE. If specific indoor requirements are
adopted in the future, we anticipate that different testing methodologies would be required, such
as testing in representative indoor environments. It is premature to speculate on specifics of
indoor test procedures in advance of specific indoor requirements.
As discussed in Section 4, the FCC should expect, over time, location performance with VoLTE
to be slightly better than or equivalent to 2G and 3G performance. These expectations should be
validated via the maintenance testing methodology, including representative testing or “spot-
checking” as described below.
The FCC should continue to support the recommendations of CSRIC III WG3. As summarized
below from the CSRIC III WG3 “Final Report – Outdoor Location Accuracy” (March 14, 2012)
section 5.4.2 “Proposed Maintenance Approach”, the goal of maintenance testing is to identify a
method that verifies continued optimal performance of E9-1-1 location systems at the local
level. This CSRIC report recommends the following maintenance testing approaches in lieu of
repeated county-level compliance testing:
• Key performance indicators (KPIs) should be routinely monitored to help identify
instances where system performance has degraded (relative to baseline compliance
tests) and further testing and system improvements are needed at the local level.
• Enhancements to location technology should be validated in representative
environments, to ensure equivalent or improved performance. An example of this
would be the introduction of OTDOA for VoLTE.
• Spot-checking using empirical field-testing should be conducted on an as needed
basis, for example, as determined by KPI monitoring or legitimate performance
concerns from a PSAP.
• Empirical data for maintenance testing may be collected incrementally over time.
• Any significant deviations from expected prior performance levels should result in
careful investigation and re-testing of the applicable test area.
• These alternative maintenance testing methods replace the need for full compliance
testing every two years.
• All legitimate performance inquiries from a County/PSAP or other public safety
entity shall be properly investigated with full cooperation from the wireless service
provider, and any issues resolved in a timely manner.
