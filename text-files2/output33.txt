Final Report [March 8, 2019]
133 1 Results in Brief
134 1.1 Executive Summary
135 Since the first 9-1-1 call in 1968, the nation’s 9-1-1 system continues to provide the capability
136 for those in need of help to receive help during any life-threatening situation. Many existing 9-1-
137 1 systems are well beyond end of life cycle replacement and are no longer supported by the
138 manufacturers. As technology continues to advance, the legacy 9-1-1 system cannot meet the
139 needs of today’s technologies and a replacement technology is needed. The replacement
140 technology, called Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG9-1-1), replaces the circuit switched technology of
141 today’s 9-1-1 system with secure Internet Protocol (IP) technology as part of the life cycle
142 replacement of 9-1-1. Specifically, NG9-1-1 is an Internet Protocol (IP)-based system comprised
143 of managed Emergency Services IP networks (ESInets), functional elements (applications), and
144 databases that replicate traditional E9-1-1 features and functions and provides additional
145 capabilities. NG9-1-1 is designed to provide access to emergency services from all connected
146 communications sources, and provide multimedia data capabilities for Public Safety Answering
147 Points (PSAPs) and other emergency service organizations. The considerations discussed in this
148 Report will help those implementing NG9-1-1 make the transition while mitigating the risks
149 associated with the transition.
150 In accordance with the specific Objectives of Working Group 1, outlined in Section 3, the
151 Report provides an overview of the objectives, scope, methodology and background that the
152 Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) VI Working Group
153 1, Task Group 1 have followed while developing the Report.
154 The Objectives and Scope of the Report include:
155  Review of existing Best Practices regarding overall monitoring, reliability, notifications,
156 and accountability in preventing 9-1-1 outages in transitional NG9-1-1 environments.
157  Development of additional guidance on Best Practices regarding overall monitoring,
158 reliability, notifications, and accountability in preventing 9-1-1 outages in transitional
159 NG9-1-1 environments.
160  Identifying risks associated with transitional 9-1-1 systems that could result in
161 disruptions to 9-1-1 service.
162  Making recommendations to protect the NG9-1-1 network, including recommendations
163 for Best Practices and standards development.
164  Study of specific actions that originating Service Providers, 9-1-1 System Service
165 Providers and other entities in the 9-1-1 call chain should take to detect and deter outage
166 precursors before 9-1-1 calls are delivered to the ESInet gateway.
167  Recommended actions the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) could take to
168 encourage the private sector to detect or deter threats to 9-1-1 before they reach the
169 ESInet perimeter. The focus would be on identifying tools that are already available or
170 not burdensome to implement.

Final Report [March 8, 2019]
171 The Report content was developed based on industry subject matter experts represented on the
172 Working Group and relies upon relative resource information provided in previous CSRIC
173 efforts and the consideration of other industry documents related to the reliability of 9-1-1.
174 The Report defines NG9-1-1 roles and provides a common technical framework that defines
175 functional elements, interfaces and points of demarcation for transitional and end-state NG9-1-1
176 architectures. As used in this Report, the demarcation points are at the boundaries between the
177 Emergency Services Network and other partner networks with which they interconnect. The
178 Working Group performed an analysis of the various architectures, by demarcation point and
179 stakeholder1 role, to identify potential points of failure with respect to emergency call delivery,
180 location delivery and callback information delivery to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs).
181 The Report concludes with an analysis and recommendations of Best Practices related to
182 enhancing the transition from Legacy 9-1-1 to NG9-1-1, and also provides research findings on
183 commercially available tools currently used by the private sector to detect and deter 9-1-1
184 outages.
185 Service Providers and other 9-1-1 stakeholders are encouraged to review in detail the analysis
186 and findings contained throughout the Report, as well as the Recommendations in Section 13
187 (also summarized here for convenience), and the modified and new Best Practices provided in
188 Appendix B –Recommended Changes to Existing 9-1-1 Related Best Practices
189 Understanding NG9-1-1 Architectures
190  There is a need for Service Providers across all industry segments (cable, wireline,
191 wireless, Interconnected VoIP) to be able to identify within their networks service-
192 impacting events that impair or cause a total loss of service. Network events/anomalies
193 potentially impact 9-1-1 call delivery throughout the country and the Working Group
194 recommends that Service Providers ensure Product Management and Network
195 Operations personnel have a thorough understanding of the functional elements that
196 support the transitional and end-state NG9-1-1 architectures described in this Report in
197 the following sections:
198 • Section 4 describes various entities that have responsibility for managing
199 risks and reporting outages in terms of stakeholder roles that are associated
200 with different components of transitional and end-state NG9-1-1
201 architectures. These descriptions provide a basis for identifying the types of
202 failures that may be visible to entities operating different components of the
203 NG9-1-1 service architecture.
204 • Sections 5 through 9 describe the various components of transitional and end-
205 state NG9-1-1 architectures and define points of demarcation that denote the
206 logical boundaries of responsibility between the stakeholders responsible for
207 providing those components. These sections provide detailed overviews of
1 For the purposes of capturing all companies and entities that are a part of the 9-1-1 call chain
those entities are referred to as “stakeholders” throughout this Report and are defined in detail
within Section 4.1.
Page 7 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
208 the various transitional and end-state NG9-1-1 architectures to establish a
209 framework for the analysis of potential failure points.
210 Identifying Risks with Transition to NG9-1-1
211 The Working Group studied specific types of failures that originating Service Providers, 9-1-1
212 System Service Providers and other entities in the 9-1-1 call chain can detect, with the objective
213 of deterring outages before they impact 9-1-1 call and data delivery to PSAPs.
214 Section 10, Architectural Analysis, analyzes the transitional and end-state NG9-1-1
215 architectures, by demarcation point and stakeholder role, to identify potential points of failure
216 from the perspective of:
217  Call delivery failures,
218  Location delivery failures, and
219  Callback information delivery failures.
220 Potential failures in the delivery of other critical information to key architecture elements and
221 PSAPs are also identified through the definition of the demarcation points and the high-level
222 descriptions that comprise the architectural analysis.
223 This section emphasizes how transitional and end-state NG9-1-1 architectures, by their very
224 nature, limit any given stakeholder’s monitoring and reporting capabilities to those aspects of
225 the architecture to which they have visibility.
226 It is recommended that Service Providers should ensure their Product Management and Network
227 Operations personnel have a thorough understanding of the Architectural Analysis as described
228 in this Report and have a working knowledge of where potential network failures can be
229 experienced.
230 Recommended Actions to Detect and Deter Threats to 9-1-1
231 In a recent FCC publication, Summary of 9-1-1 Certification Data for 2017 [13], the Public
232 Safety and Homeland Security Bureau reported on 188 covered entities filing certifications
233 consistent with the FCC 9-1-1 certification rules. Service Providers are encouraged to review
234 the findings of the Report which contains aggregate network data from communications Service
235 Providers that offer 9-1-1, E9-1-1 or NG9-1-1 capabilities. The Report also provides insight into
236 measures that are being taken by the industry to enhance the reliability of 9-1-1 networks and
237 those recommendations are incorporated into this Report. The FCC can assist in the smooth
238 transition from Legacy 9-1-1 to NG9-1-1 by encouraging Service Providers to review in detail
239 the findings in the Summary of 9-1-1 Certification Data for 2017 as well as this CSRIC VI
240 Report. Specific attention should be paid to the network risk findings in Section 10,
241 Architectural Analysis.
242 For Service Providers and 9-1-1 stakeholders who do not have robust network monitoring
243 systems, the Working Group also recommends reviewing Section 12, Analysis of Network
244 Monitoring/Report Tools. Based on research conducted by the Working Group, this section of
245 the Report provides 9-1-1 stakeholders with a better understanding of the various network
246 elements that require monitoring and commercially available tools that can be obtained to
247 manage the various and complex elements of communications networks. The FCC clarified in
Page 8 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
248 its directive to determine if tools were commercially available and not burdensome to
249 implement. The Working Group refrained from determining if the implementation of
250 commercially available tools could be burdensome on a Service Provider. However, the
251 Working Group strongly recommends that Service Providers consider incorporating network
252 detection tools, as appropriate, to assist network operations in detecting or deterring threats to 9-
253 1-1 before they reach the ESInet perimeter.
254 The Working Group recommends that Service Providers and other stakeholders work together to
255 ensure that the system monitoring information that is needed to mitigate risks, monitor elements
256 of the NG9-1-1 infrastructure and identify 9-1-1 outages is shared between providers and that
257 the information is available to stakeholders when needed.
258 Best Practices
259 The Working Group was asked to review existing Best Practices and develop additional
260 guidance regarding overall monitoring, reliability, notifications, and accountability in preventing
261 9-1-1 outages in transitional NG9-1-1 environments. Existing CSRIC Best Practices were
262 evaluated for applicability to NG9-1-1, and gaps were observed. The Working Group made
263 recommendations on how to fill these gaps by updating existing Best Practices and defining new
264 Best Practices, primarily focused on the transition and introduction of NG9-1-1. The analysis
265 and recommendations focused on:
266  Monitoring, reliability, notifications, and accountability in preventing 9-1-1 outages in
267 transitional NG9-1-1 environments;
268  Facilitating the transition to NG9-1-1; and
269  Aiding in the protection of the NG9-1-1 network, with Best Practices.
270 Cybersecurity Considerations
271 While cybersecurity considerations are an important part of the transition to NG9-1-1, this
272 Report does not focus on cybersecurity. The Working Group recommends that stakeholders take
273 deliberate steps to consider the cybersecurity implications introduced by the transition to
274 NG9-1-1. The Working Group also recommends that a future CSRIC engage industry
275 cybersecurity experts and NG9-1-1 experts to focus on NG9-1-1 related cybersecurity
276 challenges and develop Best Practices as appropriate. See section 13.5 for further discussion.
2 Introduction
277
278 This final Report documents the efforts undertaken by the Communications Security, Reliability
279 and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) VI Working Group 1, Task Group 1 that identifies the
280 specific actions that originating Service Providers, 9-1-1 System Services Providers and other
281 entities in the 9-1-1 call chain should take to detect and deter outage precursors before 9-1-1
282 calls are delivered to the ESInet gateway.
283 A separate Report, completed by CSRIC VI Working Group 1, Task 2, provides information on
284 small carrier issues related to NG9-1-1 implementation, what barriers to implementation, if any,
285 the FCC should address and a recommended “NG9-1-1 readiness checklist” for small carriers.

Final Report [March 8, 2019]
286 As states, regions, counties and operational areas make the transition to NG9-1-1 there are
287 several elements that must be considered in order to ensure the 9-1-1 system remains reliable
288 and resilient before, during and after the transition to NG9-1-1. The key elements that need to be
289 considered are discussed in this Report.
290 The previous work that was summarized in the Task Force on Optimal Public Safety Answering
291 Point Architecture (TFOPA) Working Group 1 Supplemental Report [5], the National
292 Association of State 9-1-1 Administrators (NASNA) Model State 9-1-1 Plan [6], and the
293 National Emergency Number Association’s Standards and Best Practices [7] form the basis of
294 this Report. While these previous works provide a good baseline, a comprehensive guide that
295 can be used during the transition to NG9-1-1 was lacking. This Report helps to fill in the gaps in
296 the information that is currently available.
297 NG9-1-1 provides many advantages over the existing 9-1-1 system, including:
298  Overcoming technology limitations with today’s 9-1-1 network;
299  Faster call delivery;
300  Increased routing capability;
301  Increased routing redundancy;
302  Increased ability to support call overflow and backup;
303  Updated Geographic Information System (GIS) capabilities;
304  Better representation of Wireless Location Data and Additional Data; and
305  Enabling new technologies and media types.
306
307 The considerations that are discussed in this Report will help those implementing NG9-1-1 make
308 the transition while mitigating the risks associated with the transition. The Report begins by
309 providing an overview to the NG9-1-1 technology and identifies the demarcation points in a
310 transitional 9-1-1 network as well as those demarcation points that will exist in an NG9-1-1
311 network.
312 Sections 4 through 9 define a common technical framework, based on the NENA i3 NG9-1-1
313 system architecture specified in NENA-STA-010 [18], that is used to describe a transitional 9-
314 1-1 network. Section 10 of the Report provides an architectural analysis and identifies the risks
315 associated with transitional 9-1-1 systems that could result in 9-1-1 service disruptions.
316 Section 11 of the Report provides an analysis of Best Practices, and Section 12 provides an
317 overview of existing tools that can be used to monitor, report and track 9-1-1 systems.
318 The final sections 13 through 13.6 of the Report provide an overview of Recommendations and
319 Conclusions.

3 Objective, Scope, and Methodology for Working Group 1 Task 1
339
340 3.1 Objective for Working Group 1 Task 1
341
342 The nation’s transition from Legacy 9-1-1 circuit switched network call handling platforms to
343 NG9-1-1 IP-based Emergency Services IP networks (ESInets) and core services presents the
344 opportunity to assess the reliability and resiliency of the networks and functional elements
345 supporting the transition. The CSRIC VI Working Group 1 has been charged with examining
346 various element of the Legacy 9-1-1 and NG9-1-1 network and making recommendations that
347 assist stakeholders with the transition.
348 Specifically, Working Group 1 was charged with the following tasks:
349  Review existing Best Practices regarding overall monitoring, reliability, notifications,
350 and accountability in preventing 9-1-1 outages in transitional NG9-1-1 environments.
351  Develop additional guidance on Best Practices regarding overall monitoring, reliability,
352 notifications, and accountability in preventing 9-1-1 outages in transitional NG9-1-1
353 environments.
354  Identify risks associated with transitional 9-1-1 systems that could result in disruptions to
355 9-1-1 service.
356  Make recommendations to protect the NG9-1-1 network, including recommendations for
357 Best Practices and standards development.
Page 15 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
358  Study specific actions that originating Service Providers, 9-1-1 System Service Providers
359 and other entities in the 9-1-1 call chain should take to detect and deter outage precursors
360 before 9-1-1 calls are delivered to the ESInet gateway.
361  Recommend actions the FCC could take to encourage the private sector to detect or deter
362 threats to 9-1-1 before they reach the ESInet perimeter. The focus would be on
363 Identifying tools that are already available or not burdensome to implement.
364
365 Working Group 1 was organized into two separate Task Groups to address the deliverables
366 described above, referred to as Task 1: 9-1-1 System Reliability and Resiliency during the NG9-
367 1-1 Transition, and Task 2: Small Carrier NG9-1-1 Transition Considerations.
368 In regard to Task-1, the FCC directed CSRIC VI to recommend measures to improve both
369 legacy 9-1-1 and NG9-1-1 systems, to include recommending ways in which the FCC may
370 further the NG9-1-1 transition and enhance the reliability and effectiveness of NG9-1-1 through
371 routing redundancy and maintenance, and mitigate against the threat of outages to both legacy 9-
372 1-1 and NG9-1-1 systems.
373 In regard toTask-2, the FCC directed CSRIC VI to advise the FCC on small carrier issues related
374 to NG9-1-1 implementation, including recommendations on how the FCC could address these
375 issues. This included advice on what small carriers in the state or region need to do to be ready
376 on time to deliver their 9-1-1 traffic in an NG9-1-1compatible manner; what economic
377 disadvantages, if any, may impede small carriers in implementation of NG9-1-1; and what
378 barriers to implementation, if any, the FCC should address. CSRIC VI was also asked to
379 recommend a “NG9-1-1 readiness checklist” for small carriers analogous to the one the Task
380 Force on Optimal Public Safety Answering Point Architecture (TFOPA) [3] developed for
381 PSAPs.
382 This Report is dedicated to the deliverables and recommendations of Task 1. The findings and
383 recommendations of Task 2 were drafted and adopted by CSRIC VI in a separate Report in the
384 Fall of 2018.
385 3.2 Scope for Working Group 1 Task 1
386 As described above, the first task of the Working Group was to review existing Best Practices
387 and develop additional guidance regarding overall monitoring, reliability, notifications, and
388 accountability in preventing 9-1-1 outages in transitional NG9-1-1 environments. In particular,
389 the Working Group identified risks associated with transitional 9-1-1 systems that could result in
390 disruptions to 9-1-1 service and make recommendations to protect them, including
391 recommendations for Best Practices and standards development.
392 In the first version of this Report, the Working Group performed an initial analysis of existing
393 Best Practices. The Working Group studied specific actions that originating Service Providers,
394 9-1-1 System Service Providers and other entities in the 9-1-1 call chain should take to detect
Page 16 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
395 and deter outage precursors before 9-1-1 calls are delivered to the ESInet gateway2. For the
396 purposes of capturing all companies and entities that are a part of the 9-1-1 call chain those
397 entities are referred to as “stakeholders” throughout this Report and are defined in detail within
398 Section 4.1.
399 In this second version of the Task 1 Report, modifications to existing Best Practices are
400 proposed and new Best Practices are identified.
401 3.3 Methodology for Working Group 1 Task 1
402 Analysis of Failure Detection Points in Transitional and End-State NG9-1-1
403 Architectures
404 Based on a review of ATIS-0500034 [1], Working Group members were able to describe
405 transitional and end-state NG9-1-1 architectures and stakeholder roles applicable to those
406 architectures. Having gained an understanding of the functional elements and interfaces that
407 comprise the various architectures, the Working Group then identified points of demarcation
408 applicable to the NG9-1-1 architectures, denoting the logical boundaries of responsibility
409 between the stakeholders. The Working Group then performed an analysis of the various
410 architectures, by demarcation point and stakeholder role, to identify potential points of failure
411 with respect to emergency call delivery, location delivery and callback information delivery to
412 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). These particular failure types were selected for
413 analysis because of their alignment with existing E9-1-1 metrics associated with call delivery
414 and Automatic Number Identification (ANI)/Automatic Location Identification (ALI) failures.
415 The Working Group recognized that ALI failures include a failure to deliver both location and
416 non-location information such as Class of Service, and Service Provider contact information. In
417 an NG9-1-1 environment, non-location ALI-type information is conveyed as “Additional Data.”
418 While the analysis did not include separate subsections associated with failures to deliver
419 “Additional Data”, the Working Group addressed Additional Data delivery through the
420 definition of the demarcation points and the high-level descriptions provided as part of the
421 architectural analysis.
422 Methodology of the Analysis of Best Practices
423 The Best Practices review process consisted of an initial review of the existing FCC Best
424 Practices, of which there are over 1000. The Working Group assessed each Best Practice to
425 assure it was still accurate and to determine whether it applied to Public Safety. Where
426 applicable, “Public Safety” was added if not already included in the Best Practice. In addition,
427 some Best Practices associated with emergency services were modified (updated) to reflect their
428 applicability to not only E9-1-1, but NG9-1-1. As gaps were identified, the Working Group
429 defined new Best Practices that are applicable to emergency services, specifically NG9-1-1.
430 Also, the Working Group identified a new Keyword called “Interconnection” associated with
431 those Best Practices that were applicable to cases where two or more parties connect their
2 The term ESInet gateway was interpreted to mean the generic egress from an Originating
Service Provider to an ESInet.

Final Report [March 8, 2019]
432 networks, or for cases of interoperability between to two or more parties. The modified Best
433 Practices are provided in the tables in Appendix B –Recommended Changes to Existing 9-1-1
434 Related Best Practices
435
436 Methodology of Network Monitoring/ Reporting Tool Research
437 The methodology conducted in order to make recommendations on actions the FCC could take
438 to encourage the private sector to detect or deter threats to 9-1-1 before they reach the ESInet
439 perimeter was achieved through research with member companies of the Working Group. The
440 focus of the research was on identifying tools that were commercially available, or if tools being
441 used to detect and deter network anomalies were proprietary or internally developed systems.
442 The FCC charter also clarified that the tools were not to be burdensome to implement. The
443 Working Group believed it was not in the position to determine if its findings were burdensome
444 on a carrier and this is discussed further in Section 12 of the Report.
445 The research sought to understand:
446  What tools responding companies used to detect, deter and report transport related
447 issues. Are those tools commercially available, or developed internally by the responding
448 organization?
449  What tools responding companies used to detect and report any routing related issues
450 (E9-1-1 and NG9-1-1 environments)? Are those tools commercially available, or
451 developed internally by the responding organization?
452  What tools responding companies used to detect and report any proxy or other NG9-1-1
453 related issues which would apply if the responding organizations were running any of its
454 own NG9-1-1 functional elements such as a Location Information Server (LIS), Legacy
455 Network Gateway (LNG) or Legacy Selective Router Gateway (LSRG)? Are those tools
456 commercially available, or developed internally by the responding organization?
457  What tools responding companies used to detect and report any cyber or information
458 security threat related issues? Are those tools commercially available, or developed
459 internally by the responding organization?
460  Which information security management framework(s) (if any) was applied to a
461 responders NG9-1-1 products and services (if applicable)?
462  What other recommendations, tools, key performance indicators or capabilities are
463 available that will assist in ensuring network reliability and help increase the situational
464 awareness capabilities of the NG9-1-1 Service Providers, 9-1-1 Administrators, and/or
465 PSAPs?
466
467 The results of the research can be found in Section 12 Analysis of Network
468 Monitoring/Reporting Tool Research.

4 Background
469
470 4.1 Definition of 9-1-1 Networks and Services
471 There is a need for Service Providers across all industry segments (cable, wireline, and
472 wireless), in all stages of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) transition, to be able
473 to identify when their networks may be experiencing service-impacting events that impair or
474 cause the total loss of 9-1-1 services. As service architectures to support 9-1-1 calling and data
475 delivery evolve to NG9-1-1, there is a need to better understand the complexities of how
476 NG9-1-1 service architectures are designed and where they diverge from the pre-existing legacy
477 E9-1-1 network infrastructures. This information will be critical for Service Providers to know
478 so as to:
479 a) collect network information that may be reportable under the Part 4 Rules [14] [15];
480 b) define new metrics to support such reporting requirements, and
481 c) determine if standardization efforts are needed related to those new metrics for data
482 collection.
483 The purpose of this section is to compare the service architectures used today to provide E9-1-1,
484 with transitional and end-state NG9-1-1 service architectures and to identify where in those
485 architectures service-impacting events can be detected. However, it should be noted that the
486 technical limitations outlined in this Report limit any given stakeholder’s monitoring and
487 reporting capabilities; that cannot be understated.
488 Stakeholders
489 It is important to identify stakeholders who have responsibility for managing risks and reporting
490 outages. The TFOPA report [4] defines stakeholders and ATIS-0500034 [1] expands these to
491 provide more granularity when assessing where failures may occur and how remedies may be
492 applied.
493 4.1.1.1 TFOPA Description of Stakeholder Roles
494 The TFOPA report defines three stakeholders as shown in Figure 1. It defines the Originating
495 Service Environment (OSE), 9-1-1 System Service Provider, and Local 9-1-1 Authority
496 (including the PSAP).
497
Page 19 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
498
499 Figure 1 – TFOPA Roles and Relationships
500 The TFOPA report defines originating Service Provider stakeholders as:
501 “This report introduces the expanded nature of NG9-1-1, including what is termed the Originating Service
502 Environment (OSE). This environment includes IP call set-up, location determination, validation and delivery to
503 ESInets across the country.”
504 The TFOPA report defines 9-1-1 System Service Provider as:
505 “9-1-1 System Service Provider: the operational and management entity that provides and runs the central
506 9-1-1 core services components.”
507 The TFOPA report defines 9-1-1 Authorities as:
508 “There are many variations on roles between 9-1-1 Authorities at local, regional, and state levels (including
509 some areas where none of the three formally exist). When viewed at a national level however, there is a gradual
510 trend toward the roles and relationships depicted above as NG9-1-1 work proceeds. The 9-1-1 Authority term is
511 somewhat generic, as the name of organizations that fill that role vary greatly, such as 9-1-1 Administrator,
512 Emergency Telephone Service Board (ETSB), etc. In many cases, the regional or state 9-1-1 Authority does not
513 have direct governance over the local 9-1-1 Authorities. As this report discusses, referencing the organizational
514 roles in the figure above instead of just the physical components involved is one way to more clearly state the
515 nature of relationships in the 9-1-1 environment.”
Page 20 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
516 ATIS-0500034 [1] discusses stakeholders in similar categories but provides more granularity in
517 order to enumerate the methods for reporting, monitoring and risk management.
518 4.1.1.2 Description of Stakeholder Roles in ATIS-0500034
519 Stakeholder Role descriptions provide a common understanding of how the terms are used
520 within ATIS-0500034 [1]. The rationale is that not everyone will know what any of these roles
521 do and do not do. These Stakeholder Roles may be implementation and business model specific.
522 It is also important to point out that sometimes any single company/entity might serve in
523 multiple roles, e.g., an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) could be serving as an
524 Originating Service Provider (OSP) (legacy or IP-based), a Legacy Network Gateway (LNG)
525 operator, an NG9-1-1 System Service Provider (NG9-1-1SSP), a Legacy PSAP Gateway (LPG)
526 Operator, and Location Retrieval Function (LRF) Operator, or any combination of those. A
527 government entity (e.g., 9-1-1 Authority) could serve in any of these roles. And in some cases,
528 the provider of any of these roles may not be subject to FCC reporting responsibilities.
529 To the extent possible, the following descriptions are based on the National Emergency Number
530 Association (NENA) Master Glossary of 9-1-1 Terminology [8].
531 4.1.1.2.1 Originating Service Provider (OSP) Using Legacy Technology3
532 A legacy-based OSP role provides the ability for a caller to make calls. In the context of this
533 document, it is focused on the ability to make 9-1-1 calls. It is the OSP’s responsibility to
534 forward 9-1-1 calls toward the serving Emergency Services Network. Since the legacy-based
535 OSP is using non-IP technology, calls destined for an NG Emergency Services Network must go
536 through a gateway.
537
538 The OSP-Legacy role may be provided by traditional “phone companies”, competitive “phone
539 companies”, or other private or public communications entities that are not using IP-based
540 technology.
541 4.1.1.2.2 Originating Service Provider (OSP)-IP-Based Technology
542 An IP-based OSP role provides the ability for a caller to make calls using Internet Protocol (IP)
543 signaling.
544 In the context of this document, it is focused on the ability to make IP-based 9-1-1 calls. It is the
545 OSP’s responsibility to forward 9-1-1 calls toward the serving Emergency Services Network.
546 Since the IP-based OSP is using IP technology, calls destined for an NG Emergency Services
547 Network are not required to go through a gateway, provided that the OSP can deliver calls over
3 OSPs may interwork calls originated using legacy technologies to IP signaling, however those
calls must still go through a gateway to access NG9-1-1-specific interworking functionality.
Calls from non-IP enabled endpoint devices must go through a gateway that provides both
protocol interworking and NG9-1-1-specific interworking.
Page 21 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
548 an IP-based interface to the serving NG emergency services network using a compatible NG9-1-
549 1 signaling format (e.g., deliver using NENA-i3 compatible SIP interface).
550
551 The OSP-IP role may be provided by traditional “phone companies”, competitive “phone
552 companies”, or other private or public communications entities that are using IP-based
553 technology.
554 4.1.1.2.3 Legacy Network Gateway (LNG) Operator
555 The LNG is an NG9-1-1 Functional Element that provides an interface between a non-IP
556 originating network and an NG Emergency Services Network. In this document, the entity that
557 provides the LNG is referred to as the LNG operator. That would typically be the NG9-1-1
558 System Service Provider (SSP) or the OSP-Legacy. It could also be a government entity or a
559 third party.
560 4.1.1.2.4 E9-1-1 System Service Provider (E9-1-1SSP) 4
561 An E9-1-1SSP provides systems and support necessary to enable 9-1-1 calling for one or more
562 PSAPs in a specific geographic area. Traditionally, the ILEC has provided this role but other
563 models are possible, including arrangements in which the 9-1-1 Authority may choose to operate
564 or outsource pieces of the network.
565 The E9-1-1SSP role includes providing:
566  A method of interconnection for all telecommunications providers, including but not
567 limited to wireline, wireless, and VoIP carriers.
568  A method and mechanism for routing a 9-1-1 call to the PSAP with no degradation in
569 service regardless of the technology used to originate the call.
570  A method to provide accurate location information for an emergency caller to a PSAP
571 and, if required, to other emergency response agencies.
572  For those entities that have responsibility to report to the FCC, a method of capturing
573 outage information and reporting such information via FCC reporting mechanisms.
574  Installation of PSAP call handling equipment and training of PSAP personnel when
575 contracted to do so.
576  Coordinating with PSAP authorities and other telecommunications entities for
577 troubleshooting and on issues involving contingency planning, disaster mitigation, and
578 recovery.
579  Support for Legacy Selective Router Gateway (LSRG) functionality to facilitate the
580 interconnection of legacy Selective Routers with NG Emergency Services Networks.
581
4 The roles and responsibilities of a 9-1-1SSP (whether E9-1-1SSP or NG9-1-1SSP) are
essentially the same, even though the technology has evolved. As stakeholders continue to work
through the implementation details the similarities may change.
Page 22 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
582 4.1.1.2.5 Next Generation 9-1-1 System Service Provider (NG9-1-1SSP) 4
583 An NG9-1-1SSP provides systems and support necessary to enable 9-1-1 calling for one or more
584 PSAPs in a specific geographic area. In the past (in E9-1-1) it was typically, but not always, an
585 ILEC. In NG9-1-1, the role is more open to competition, and there are NG Emergency Services
586 Networks in use that are provided by various entities, some of whom specialize in the NG9-1-
587 1SSP role.
588 The NG9-1-1SSP role includes providing:
589  A method of interconnection for all telecommunications providers, including but not
590 limited to wireline, wireless, and VoIP carriers.
591  A method and mechanism for routing a 9-1-1 call to the PSAP with no degradation in
592 service regardless of the technology used to originate the call.
593  A method to provide accurate location information for an emergency caller to a PSAP
594 and, if required, to other emergency response agencies.
595  For those entities that have responsibility to report to the FCC, a method of capturing
596 outage information and reporting such information via FCC reporting mechanisms.
597  Installation of PSAP call handling equipment and training of PSAP personnel when
598 contracted to do so.
599  Coordinating with PSAP authorities and other telecommunications entities for
600 troubleshooting and on issues involving contingency planning, disaster mitigation, and
601 recovery.
602 4.1.1.2.6 Legacy Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) Gateway (LPG) Operator
603 The LPG is an NG9-1-1 Functional Element that provides an interface between an NG
604 Emergency Services Network and a legacy PSAP.
605 In this Report, the entity that provides the LPG is referred to as the LPG operator. That would
606 typically be the NG9-1-1SSP or the 9-1-1 Authority/PSAP, but it could be a third party
607
5 OSP Interconnection to NG9-1-1 Emergency Services Networks
608
609 The goal of NG9-1-1 is to provide at least E9-1-1-equivalent functionality in support of
610 emergency call originations from fixed, nomadic, and mobile IP users, and to build on those
611 capabilities to improve performance and extend feature functionality (e.g., to support delivery of
612 text-based emergency services requests to PSAPs). There are a number of alternative NG9-1-1
613 Service Architectures under discussion in various industry groups. NENA has defined a long-
614 term solution for emergency calling, referred to as the i3 Solution, whose end-state assumes
615 end-to-end IP signaling from an IP-enabled endpoint to an IP-enabled PSAP, with callback and
616 caller location information provided to the PSAP with the call. Similarly, a joint work group in
617 ATIS has defined the architecture, protocol, and procedures to support the processing of
618 emergency calls by an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)-based NG Emergency Services
619 Network. Regardless of the Functional Elements and interfaces that make up these architectures,
620 NG9-1-1 Service Architectures must, at a minimum, support current E9-1-1 capabilities.
Page 23 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
621 A fundamental capability required of any NG Emergency Services Network is the ability to
622 selectively route an emergency call to the appropriate PSAP based on the location from which
623 the call was originated. This implies that information identifying the location of the caller must
624 be available at any routing element in the call path. Emergency call setup in an NG9-1-1
625 environment is expected to be Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-based. The SIP signaling
626 associated with an emergency session request is expected to include location information, either
627 “by value” (i.e., as a Presence Information Data Format–Location Object [PIDF-LO]) in the
628 body of the SIP message or “by reference” (where a location reference is included in the SIP
629 signaling and can be dereferenced to obtain the location value/PIDF-LO). The routing element is
630 expected to use a location value to query a call routing function to obtain routing information for
631 the call. The location information used as input to the call routing function can either be in the
632 form of a civic/street address or geo-coordinates. The output of the call routing function is
633 expected to be in the form of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
634 If location-based routing cannot be performed because sufficient information is not received
635 with the call to allow the location-based process to be successful (e.g., location information is
636 not received with the call, or a route cannot be determined for the location value associated with
637 the call), the NG Emergency Services Network must be able to route the call using a default
638 location or default next hop URI (as appropriate for the abnormal condition encountered).
639 Alternate/Overflow routing allows the NG Emergency Services Network to temporarily redirect
640 emergency calls to/toward a pre-designated alternate PSAP(s)/destination(s) (e.g., call center)
641 when the primary PSAP or next hop element is not available to take calls (e.g., due to
642 network/PSAP conditions or other policy).
643 When the NG Emergency Services Network delivers an emergency call to an NG PSAP, it is
644 expected to generate SIP signaling that includes location information (by-value or by-reference),
645 callback information, and Additional Data (by-value and/or by-reference). The location
646 information that the NG Emergency Service Network signals to an NG PSAP will be the same
647 as the location information that it received in incoming SIP signaling. For example, if a routing
648 element within the NG Emergency Services Network receives location-by-reference in a SIP
649 INVITE message associated with an incoming emergency call, and it dereferences that location
650 reference to obtain a location-by-value with which to query a location-based routing functional
651 element, it will still send the location-by-reference forward in outgoing SIP signaling to/toward
652 the NG PSAP.
653 Likewise, routing elements in the NG Emergency Services Network may receive Additional
654 Data associated with a call by reference and/or by value in an incoming SIP INVITE message
655 associated with an emergency call. The routing element is expected to pass the Additional Data
656 to/toward the NG PSAP in the same form as it was received. Today, PSAPs receive non-location
657 information, such as class of service information, associated with an emergency call, in the
658 response from the ALI system. PSAPs that receive emergency calls from the NG Emergency
659 Services Network must, at a minimum, have the same type of non-location information available
660 to them as is available in ALI responses today.

663 Figure 2 provides a high-level functional architecture diagram illustrating an end-state (i.e.,
664 all-IP) NG9-1-1 Service Architecture and how emergency calls are processed using this
665 architecture.

670 1. The emergency call/session request is delivered by the IP originating network (via a
671 Border Control Function) to a routing proxy in the NG Emergency Services Network
672 with callback information and location information.
673  Location may be delivered “by-value” (i.e., the civic location/street address or
674 geo-coordinate location is contained within the SIP signaling message).
675  Location may be delivered “by-reference” (i.e., the SIP signaling message
676 contains a “pointer” or “reference” to the location information that includes the
677 address of the element from which the location information can be obtained and a
678 “key” to the data).
679 2. If the location information is received “by-reference”, the location retrieval
680 functionality within or accessible to the routing proxy will be invoked.
Page 25 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
681 A dereference request will be sent to the element identified in the location reference
682 (i.e., the Location Server [LS]) to obtain a routing location for the call using the
683 HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) dereferencing protocol, as specified in
684 IETF RFC 67535 The response from the MPC/GMLC will include initial (typically
685 Phase I) location information.
686  If location is received “by-value”, this step will be omitted.
687  The routing proxy uses the location information received in incoming SIP
688 signaling (location-by-value) or obtained by dereferencing a
689 location-by-reference to query a routing database.
690  The routing database is queried using the Location to Service Translation (LoST)
691 protocol.
692  The LoST routing query contains location information and an appropriate service
693 identifier (i.e., a service Uniform Resource Name [URN] in the “sos” family).
694  The routing response contains the address of the “next hop” in call path, in the
695 form of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
696 3. The routing proxy forwards the emergency call/session request (with the same
697 callback and location information as it received in incoming SIP signaling) to the
698 “next hop” element based on the URI received in the LoST response.
699  The “next hop” element may be the PSAP or it may be another routing proxy in
700 the call path, depending on the way the NG9-1-1 Service Architecture is
701 implemented.
702 4. If the next hop in the call path is another routing proxy, and the location information
703 was received in incoming SIP signaling “by-reference”, the routing proxy will invoke
704 location retrieval functionality within or accessible to it to retrieve a routing location
705 for the call.
706  A HELD dereference request will be sent to the same element (LS) that the first
707 routing proxy queried to get a routing location.
708  If location is received “by-value”, this step will be omitted.
709 5. If present in the call path, the routing proxy will use the location information
710 received in incoming SIP signaling (location-by-value) or obtained by dereferencing
711 a location-by-reference, and a service URN, to query a routing database using the
712 LoST protocol.
713 6. The routing proxy forwards the emergency call/session request (with the same
714 callback and location information as it received in incoming SIP signaling) to the
715 “next hop” element based on the URI received in the LoST response.
716  In this example, the “next hop” is assumed to be the target PSAP for the
717 emergency call.
718  In this example, the target PSAP is assumed to be an i3/NG PSAP.
5 This example illustrates location dereferencing using the HELD dereferencing protocol. NG9-
1-1 standards also allow the use of a SIP-based location dereferencing mechanism.
Page 26 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
719 7. If the location information delivered to the PSAP is a location-by-reference, the
720 PSAP will send a HELD dereference request to the element identified in the location
721 reference (i.e., the LS) to obtain an estimated caller location for the call.
722 5.2 Transitional/Interworking Architectures in Support of Emergency
723 Calling
724 Although NG9-1-1 is defined to utilize an end-to-end IP architecture, there will continue to be
725 legacy wireline and wireless (circuit switched) originating networks deployed after emergency
726 service networks and a significant number of PSAPs have evolved to support NG9-1-1
727 architectures. Since any PSAPs served by NG Emergency Services Networks will need to be
728 able to receive emergency calls that originate on these legacy networks, gateway functionality
729 will be a required part of an NG9-1-1 Service Architecture.
730 The gateway functionality that supports the interconnection of a legacy originating network and
731 an NG Emergency Services Network, referred to by NENA as a Legacy Network Gateway
732 (LNG), must include signaling interworking to convert the incoming Multi-Frequency (MF) or
733 Signaling System Number 7 (SS7) signaling generated by a legacy origination network to the
734 IP-based (i.e., SIP) signaling supported by an NG Emergency Services Network. 6
735 In addition, since routing within the NG Emergency Services Network will be based on location,
736 the Legacy Network Gateway on the ingress side of an NG Emergency Services Network must
737 support the ability to use the information provided by a wireline switch or Mobile Switching
738 Center (MSC) in call setup signaling (e.g., calling number/ANI, Emergency Services Routing
739 Key [ESRK], cell site/sector represented by an Emergency Services Routing Digit [ESRD]) to
740 retrieve location information that can be used as input to routing determination. Based on the
741 routing location provided, the routing determination function will identify which Emergency
742 Services Network should handle the call. Routing location will also be used to support routing
743 within the NG Emergency Services Network. Gateway functionality will also be needed to
744 enable interactions between NG Emergency Services Network elements (and the PSAPs they
745 serve) and legacy systems, such as MPCs/GMLCs, to support the retrieval of caller location to
746 support the dispatch of emergency personnel.
747 In addition to gateway functionality on the ingress side of an NG Emergency Services Network,
748 there will be a need to support gateway functionality on the egress side of the NG Emergency
749 Services Network. That is due to the fact that, while an increasing number of PSAPs will evolve
750 to support NG functionality over time, NG Emergency Services Networks must be able to
751 deliver emergency calls to interconnected legacy PSAPs, as well as to legacy Emergency
752 Services Networks.
753 In regard to interfacing with a legacy PSAP, the NG9-1-1 Service Architecture must include a
754 functional element that will provide signaling interworking and other functionality necessary for
755 emergency calls routed via the NG Emergency Services Network to be delivered to and handled
6 In some implementations, legacy origination networks may support circuit switch to IP-based
signaling, making MF or SS7 interworking to IP based signaling at the LNG unnecessary.
Page 27 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
756 by legacy PSAPs without requiring changes to legacy PSAP Customer Premises Equipment
757 (CPE). That functional element is, defined by NENA as a Legacy PSAP Gateway (LPG).
758 Calls routed via an NG Emergency Services Network and delivered to a legacy PSAP must
759 undergo signaling interworking to convert the incoming IP-based (i.e., SIP) signaling supported
760 by the NG Emergency Services Network to the Traditional MF or Enhanced MF (E-MF)
761 signaling supported by the legacy PSAP. Functionality must also be applied by the NG
762 Emergency Services Network to emergency call originations to allow the legacy PSAP to
763 experience call delivery, ALI data retrieval, and feature activation the same way as they do
764 today. The LPG handles those functions.
765 Support for Interconnection of NG Emergency Services Networks & Legacy
766 Originating Networks
767 To support emergency calls that originate in legacy networks, the NENA i3 Solution and ATIS
768 IMS-based NG9-1-1 Service Architecture include the Legacy Network Gateway (LNG)
769 functional element. The LNG logically resides between the originating network and the NG
770 Emergency Services Network and allows PSAPs served by the NG Emergency Services
771 Network to receive emergency calls from legacy originating networks. The LNG provides
772 protocol interworking from the SS7 or MF signaling that it receives from a legacy originating
773 network to the SIP signaling used in the NG Emergency Services Network. In addition, the LNG
774 is responsible for routing emergency calls to the appropriate element in the appropriate NG
775 Emergency Services Network. To support this routing function, the LNG applies
776 NG9-1-1-specific interworking functionality to legacy emergency calls that allows the
777 information provided in the call setup signaling by the wireline switch or MSC (e.g., calling
778 number/ANI, ESRK, ESRD) to be used as input to the retrieval of routing location (in the form
779 of a street address or geo-coordinate location) from an associated location server/database. The
780 LNG uses this location information to query a call routing function to obtain routing information
781 in the form of a URI. The LNG must then forward the emergency call/session request to a
782 routing element in the NG Emergency Services Network, using the URI provided by the call
783 routing function. The LNG will include callback and location information in the outgoing SIP
784 signaling.
785 The location server/database associated with an LNG must support mappings from a specific
786 calling number/ANI or pANI (e.g., ESRK, ESRD) value to a location that will result in the
787 emergency call being routed to the target PSAP associated with the calling number/ANI/pANI.
788 In addition to identifying the location to be used for emergency call routing, the LNG is also
789 responsible for providing caller location to PSAPs for emergency calls that originate in legacy
790 networks. The mechanisms used by an LNG to access caller location are comparable to those
791 used by an ALI system to provide caller location to a PSAP in an E9-1-1 environment (i.e., by
792 accessing provisioned data and steering queries to MPC/GMLCs in wireless originating
793 networks, as appropriate).
794 Figure 3 provides a High-Level Functional Architecture diagram illustrating how emergency
795 calls are processed using an interworking architecture involving an LNG.

799 1. A 9-1-1 call is delivered by the legacy originating network to a Legacy Network
800 Gateway (LNG) over an MF or SS7 trunk group7 8.
801  Legacy wireline originations are delivered with the SS7 Calling Party Number or
802 MF ANI.
803  Legacy wireless originations are delivered with an ESRK as the SS7 Calling
804 Party Number or MF ANI, or with the Mobile Directory Number as the SS7
805 Calling Party Number/MF ANI and an ESRD/ESRK in the SS7 Generic Digits
806 parameter/MF called number.
807 2. The LNG will interact with a local location database which will map the calling
808 number/ANI/ESRK/ESRD to a routing location.
809 3. If the call is a legacy wireless emergency call, the LNG will also send an E2 or MLP
810 query to the MPC/GMLC in the legacy wireless network requesting initial caller
811 location.
812  The location query will include the ESRK, or MDN + ESRK/ESRD.
813  The response from the MPC/GMLC will include initial (typically Phase I)
814 location information.
7 Some LNGs may support SIP ingress in addition to MF and SS7.
8 Legacy Originating Networks may deliver traffic using an aggregation service that
interconnects via BCF to the NG Emergency Services Network.

Final Report [March 8, 2019]
815 4. The LNG queries a routing database using the routing location obtained in Step 2
816 using the LoST protocol.
817  The LNG queries the routing database with the routing location and an
818 appropriate service URN.
819  The routing database provides the address of a routing proxy in the NG
820 Emergency Services Network.
821 5. The emergency call is delivered by the LNG (via a Border Control Function) to a
822 routing proxy in the NG Emergency Services Network with a callback number and
823 location information.
824  If the call is a legacy wireline emergency call, the location obtained in Step 2 will
825 typically be delivered “by-value” and will be in the form of a civic location/street
826 address.
827  If the call is a legacy wireless emergency call, the location will typically be
828 delivered “by-reference” to allow location updates associated with the mobile
829 caller to be requested.
830 6. If the location information is received “by-reference” the location retrieval
831 functionality within or associated with the routing proxy will be invoked.
832  A HELD dereference request will be sent to the LNG to obtain a routing location
833 for the call; the LNG will return the routing location obtained in Step 2.
834  If location is received “by-value”, this step will be omitted.
835 7. The routing proxy uses the location information received in incoming SIP signaling
836 (location-by-value) or obtained by dereferencing a location-by-reference to query a
837 routing database.
838  The routing database is queried using the LoST protocol.
839  The LoST routing query contains location information and an appropriate service
840 identifier (i.e., a service URN in the “sos” family).
841  The routing response contains the address of the “next hop” in the call path, in
842 the form of a URI.
843 8. The routing proxy forwards the emergency call/session request (with the same
844 callback and location information as it received in incoming SIP signaling) to the
845 “next hop” element based on the URI received in the LoST response.
846  The “next hop” element may be the PSAP or it may be another routing proxy in
847 the call path, depending on the way the NG9-1-1 Service Architecture is
848 implemented.
849 9. If the next hop in the call path is another routing proxy, and the location information
850 was received in incoming SIP signaling “by-reference”, the routing proxy will invoke
851 location retrieval functionality within or accessible to it to retrieve a routing location
852 for the call.
853  A HELD dereference request will be sent to the LNG, and the LNG will return
854 the routing location obtained in Step 2.
855  If location is received “by-value”, this step will be omitted.
856 10. If present in the call path, the routing proxy will use the location information
857 received in incoming SIP signaling (location-by-value) or obtained by dereferencing
Page 30 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
858 a location-by-reference, along with a service URN, to query a routing database using
859 the LoST protocol.
860 11. The routing proxy forwards the emergency call/session request (with the same
861 callback and location information as it received in incoming SIP signaling) to the
862 “next hop” element based on the URI received in the LoST response.
863  In this example, the “next hop” is assumed to be the target PSAP for the
864 emergency call.
865  In this example, the target PSAP is assumed to be an i3/NG PSAP.
866 12. If the location information delivered to the PSAP is a location-by-reference, the
867 PSAP will send a HELD dereference request to the LNG to obtain caller location.
868 13. If the location dereference request from the i3/NG PSAP indicates that initial
869 location should be returned, the LNG will return the initial caller location
870 information obtained in Step 3. If the location dereference request from the i3/NG
871 PSAP indicates that updated location should be returned, the LNG will send an E2 or
872 MLP query to the MPC/GMLC requesting updated (i.e., Phase II) location.
873 14. The LNG returns the updated location information to the i3/NG PSAP.
874 Support for Interconnection of NG Emergency Services Networks & Legacy
875 Selective Routers
876 During the transition period while the Emergency Services infrastructure migrates toward IP,
877 and PSAPs evolve to support i3/NG functionality, wireline and wireless callers and PSAPs that
878 are served by legacy Selective Routers (SRs), will need to be supported. A Legacy Selective
879 Router Gateway (LSRG) will provide the needed functionality to facilitate emergency call
880 handling in transitional architectures where legacy SRs and ALIs are still present. The LSRG is
881 a signaling and media connection point between a legacy SR and an NG Emergency Services
882 Network. The LSRG allows emergency originations routed via a legacy SR to terminate on an
883 NG PSAP, as well as allowing calls routed via an NG Emergency Services Network to terminate
884 to a legacy PSAP that is connected to a legacy SR. The LSRG also facilitates transfers of calls
885 between PSAPs that are served by legacy SRs and PSAPs that are served by NG Emergency
886 Services Networks, regardless of the type of network from which the call originated.
887 This section describes the interconnection of legacy originating networks that continue to be
888 served by legacy SRs with NG9-1-1 Emergency Services Networks via an LSRG on the ingress
889 side of the NG9-1-1 Emergency Services Network. (See Section 9 for details related to
890 transitional architectures in which LSRGs are used to interconnect NG9-1-1 Emergency
891 Services Networks with legacy PSAPs that are served by Selective Routers).
892 Calls originating in legacy end offices or MSCs and routed via a legacy SR must undergo
893 signaling interworking to convert the incoming SS7 signaling used by the SR to the SIP-based
894 signaling supported by the NG Emergency Services Network. An LSRG on the ingress side of
895 the NG Emergency Services Network supports an SS7 interface on the SR side, and a SIP
896 interface toward the NG Emergency Services Network. The LSRG must support functionality to
897 interwork the SS7 signaling that it receives from the SR with the SIP signaling used in the NG
898 Emergency Services Network.
Page 31 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
899 The LSRG is also responsible for routing emergency calls that originate in a network that is
900 connected to the SR to the appropriate (routing) element in the NG Emergency Services
901 Network. To support this routing, the LSRG must apply service-specific interworking
902 functionality to legacy emergency calls to allow the information provided by the wireline switch
903 or MSC (e.g., calling number/ANI, ESRK, ESRD) in the call setup signaling, and passed to the
904 LSRG through the SR, to be used as input to the retrieval of routing and caller location. The
905 LSRG obtains caller location information by querying a legacy ALI database using the “key”
906 (i.e., calling number/ANI, ESRK, ESRD) provided in call setup signaling. The LSRG obtains
907 routing location either from the ALI database (e.g., for wireline originations) or by mapping the
908 received ESRK/ESRD to a location that will result in the call being routed to the target PSAP.
909 The LSRG uses the routing location to query a call routing function to obtain routing
910 information in the form of a URI. The LSRG must then forward the emergency call/session
911 request to the appropriate element in the NG Emergency Services Network, based on the URI
912 provided by the routing function. The LSRG includes callback and location information in the
913 outgoing SIP signaling sent to the NG Emergency Services Network.
914 Figure 4 provides a High-Level Functional Architecture diagram illustrating how emergency
915 calls are processed using a transitional architecture involving an ingress LSRG.

919 1. A 9-1-1 call is delivered by the legacy originating network to a legacy SR over an
920 MF or SS7 trunk group
Page 32 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
921  Legacy wireline originations will be delivered with the SS7 Calling Party
922 Number or MF ANI.
923  Legacy wireless originations will be delivered with an ESRK as the SS7 Calling
924 Party Number or MF ANI, or with the Mobile Directory Number as the SS7
925 Calling Party Number/MF ANI and an ESRD/ESRK in the SS7 Generic Digits
926 parameter/MF called number.
927 2. The SR queries a Selective Routing Database (SRDB) using the calling number/ANI,
928 ESRK, or ESRD (based on the signaling received over the trunk group from the end
929 office/MSC); the SRDB returns an Emergency Service Number (ESN) that points to
930 a trunk group to an LSRG.
931 3. The SR delivers the emergency call to the LSRG over an SS7-supported trunk group.
932  The SS7 signaling will include the information (i.e., calling number/ANI, ESRK,
933 ESRD) that the SR received from the end office/MSC.
934 4. The LSRG interacts with a local location database that maps the calling
935 number/ANI/ESRK/ESRD to a routing location.
936 5. The LSRG also sends a query to the ALI system requesting caller location for the
937 emergency call.
938 6. If the call is a legacy wireless emergency call, the ALI will send an E2 or MLP query
939 to the MPC/GMLC in the legacy wireless network requesting initial caller location.
940  The location query will include the ESRK, or MDN + ESRK/ESRD.
941  The response from the MPC/GMLC will include initial (typically Phase I)
942 location information.
943 Note that this step is omitted if the call is from a legacy wireline caller.
944 7. The ALI system then returns the caller location information to the LSRG.
945 8. The LSRG queries a routing database using the routing location obtained in Step 4
946 and an appropriate service URN and receives the address of a routing proxy in the
947 NG Emergency Services Network in response.
948 9. The emergency call is delivered by the LSRG (via a Border Control Function) to a
949 routing proxy in the NG Emergency Services Network with a callback number and
950 location information.
951  If the call is a legacy wireline emergency call, the location obtained in Step 4 will
952 typically be delivered “by-value” and will be in the form of a civic location/street
953 address; the callback number will be populated with the information received in
954 the SS7 Calling Party Number parameter.
955  If the call is a legacy wireless emergency call, the location will typically be
956 delivered “by-reference” to allow location updates associated with the mobile
957 caller to be requested; the callback number will either be populated with the
958 content of the SS7 Calling Party Number parameter (if both a calling number and
959 an ESRD/ESRK was provided in the signaling from the SR), or with the callback
960 number obtained from the MPC/GMLC (if only an ESRK was provided in call
961 setup signaling from the SR).
962 10. If the location information is received by the routing proxy “by-reference”, the
963 location retrieval functionality within or accessible to the routing proxy will be
Page 33 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
964 invoked. A HELD dereference request will be sent to the LSRG to obtain a routing
965 location for the call; the LSRG will return the routing location obtained in Step 4.
966 If location is received “by-value”, this step will be omitted.
967 11. The routing proxy uses the location information received in incoming SIP signaling
968 (location-by-value), or obtained by dereferencing a location-by-reference, to query a
969 routing database.
970  The routing database is queried using the LoST protocol.
971  The LoST routing query contains location information and an appropriate service
972 identifier (i.e., a service URN in the “sos” family).
973  The routing response contains the address of the “next hop” in call path, in the
974 form of a URI.
975 12. The routing proxy forwards the emergency call/session request (with the same
976 callback and location information as it received in incoming SIP signaling) to the
977 “next hop” element based on the URI received in the LoST response.
978  The “next hop” element may be the PSAP or it may be another routing proxy in the call
979 path, depending on the way the NG9-1-1 Service Architecture is implemented.
980 13. If the next hop in the call path is another routing proxy, and the location information
981 was received in incoming SIP signaling “by-reference”, the routing proxy will invoke
982 location retrieval functionality within or accessible to it to retrieve a routing location
983 for the call. That is, the routing proxy will send a HELD dereference request to the
984 LSRG, and the LSRG will return the routing location obtained in Step 4.
985 If location is received “by-value”, this step will be omitted.
986 14. If present in the call path, the routing proxy will use the location information
987 received in incoming SIP signaling (location-by-value) or obtained by dereferencing
988 a location-by-reference, and a service URN, to query a routing database using the
989 LoST protocol.
990 15. The routing proxy forwards the emergency call/session request (with the same
991 callback and location information as it received in incoming SIP signaling) to the
992 “next hop” element based on the URI received in the LoST response.
993  In this example, the “next hop” is assumed to be the target PSAP for the emergency call,
994 and the target PSAP is an i3/NG PSAP.
995 16. If the location information delivered to the PSAP is a location-by-reference, the
996 PSAP will send a dereference request to the LSRG to obtain caller location.
997 17. If the location dereference request from the i3/NG PSAP indicates that initial
998 location should be returned, the LSRG will return the initial caller location
999 information obtained in Step 7.
1000 If the location dereference request from the i3 NG/PSAP indicates that updated location should
1001 be returned, the LSRG will send a query to the ALI system requesting caller location.
1002 18. If the ALI receives a rebid request from the LSRG, the ALI will send an E2 or MLP
1003 query to the MPC/GMLC requesting updated (i.e., Phase II) location.
1004 19. The ALI returns the content of the MPC/GMLC response to the LSRG.
1005 20. The LSRG returns the updated location information to the i3/NG PSAP.

6 NG9-1-1 Emergency Services Network Interconnection with
1006
Legacy PSAPs
1007
1008 6.1 Transitional NG9-1-1 Service Architectures Involving Legacy PSAP
1009 Gateways
1010 In addition to supporting the delivery of emergency calls to NG PSAPs, NG Emergency
1011 Services Networks are required to support the delivery of emergency calls to legacy PSAPs. To
1012 support the delivery of emergency calls that are routed via NG Emergency Services Networks to
1013 a legacy PSAP, NG9-1-1 Service Architectures include a Legacy PSAP Gateway (LPG) that
1014 serves as the signaling and media interconnection point between the NG Emergency Services
1015 Network and the legacy PSAP. The LPG is expected to provide special processing of the
1016 information received in incoming (SIP-based) call setup signaling to facilitate call delivery to
1017 legacy PSAPs, to assist legacy PSAPs in obtaining the callback and location information
1018 necessary to handle the call and support the dispatch of emergency personnel, and to support
1019 feature functionality currently available to legacy PSAPs, such as call transfer. The SIP
1020 signaling delivered to an LPG by an NG Emergency Services Network will contain the same
1021 information as the SIP signaling that is delivered to an NG PSAP, including location information
1022 (by-reference or by-value) and callback information. The LPG will be responsible for
1023 interworking the SIP signaling to the Traditional MF or E-MF signaling that is appropriate for
1024 the interface over which the call will be delivered to the legacy PSAP. Traditional MF and E-MF
1025 interfaces to legacy PSAPs assume that callback information signaled to a PSAP will be in the
1026 form of a 7/10-digit North American Numbering Plan (NANP) number. It is possible that the
1027 callback information delivered to an LPG with an emergency call (e.g., associated with a VoIP
1028 origination) will not be in the form of (or easily converted to) a 10-digit NANP number. If a
1029 PSAP is expecting to receive callback information delivered with the call in call setup signaling,
1030 and the callback information received by the LPG is not in the form of (or easily converted to) a
1031 10-digit NANP number with an NPA that is appropriate for the target PSAP (i.e., consisting of
1032 one of four NPAs supported by a legacy PSAP that supports a Traditional MF interface), the
1033 LPG will perform a mapping from the callback information to a locally significant digit string
1034 that can be delivered to the legacy PSAP via Traditional MF or E-MF signaling (as appropriate
1035 for the PSAP). The locally significant digit string delivered to the PSAP will be of the form
1036 “NPD/NPA-511-XXXX”. The LPG will use the same mechanism to map callback information
1037 to a locally significant digit string if the callback information received in call setup signaling is
1038 in the form of a 10-digit NANP number, but the NPA is not one that is supported by the PSAP.
1039 Location information received by the LPG will be provided to the legacy PSAP outside of the
1040 call setup process via a legacy ALI interface. The LPG will look to the legacy PSAP like an ALI
1041 system and the legacy PSAP will query the LPG using the same interface as it would use to
1042 query an ALI database. Like an ALI system, when an LPG is queried with an ALI location key
1043 (i.e., callback number and/or pANI), the LPG will respond with the location and other
1044 non-location information, as appropriate for the query protocol used by the legacy PSAP. If the
1045 SIP signaling associated with an emergency call routed via the NG Emergency Services
1046 Network contains a location by value, the LPG will include that location information in the ALI
1047 response, formatted appropriately for the receiving PSAP. If the SIP signaling delivered by the
Page 35 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1048 NG Emergency Services Network to the LPG includes a location-by-reference, the LPG must
1049 first dereference the location-by-reference to obtain the location information to return to the
1050 PSAP in response to an ALI query.
1051 If the PSAP expects to receive location information (i.e., a location key) delivered with the
1052 emergency call, the LPG will generate a 10-digit key (pANI) and associate it with the location
1053 and other call information that was provided in the incoming SIP INVITE message from the NG
1054 Emergency Services Network. This pANI will be passed to the PSAP via the Traditional MF or
1055 E-MF interface (as appropriate for the PSAP) and will be used by the PSAP in the ALI query
1056 that it generates. If the PSAP expects to receive both callback and location information with the
1057 emergency call (i.e., via an E-MF interface) and a pANI of the form NPD/NPA-511-XXXX is
1058 sent in the MF sequence corresponding to the callback number, the same digit string can be
1059 generated by the LPG and delivered to the legacy PSAP as a pANI that represents the location
1060 information received by the LPG in incoming signaling.
1061 Note that, like emergency calls from non-initialized mobile devices, legacy PSAPs will not be
1062 able to initiate a callback call if the callback information associated with the emergency call is
1063 not in the form of a NANP number.
1064 Figure 5 provides a High-Level Functional Architecture diagram illustrating how emergency
1065 calls are processed using an interworking architecture involving an LPG.

Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1069 An emergency call originates in an IP originating network or legacy originating network and
1070 proceeds as described above to the point where a routing URI associated with the PSAP is
1071 obtained by a Routing Proxy. The emergency call, and associated data, is then processed as
1072 follows:
1073 A. The routing proxy forwards the emergency call/session request (with the same
1074 callback and location information as it received in incoming SIP signaling) via a BCF
1075 toward the legacy PSAP identified in the URI received in the response from the
1076 Routing Database.
1077  The routing proxy forwards the SIP INVITE message to an LPG that is
1078 appropriate for the PSAP URI (i.e., an LPG to which the PSAP URI obtained
1079 from the routing database resolves).
1080 B. Upon receiving the emergency session request from the routing proxy, the LPG
1081 performs the following functions:
1082  The LPG determines the type of interface supported by the target legacy PSAP.
1083  Call delivery to legacy PSAPs is typically via a Traditional MF or E-MF
1084 interface.
1085  A Traditional MF interface involves the signaling of an MF ANI sequence
1086 that consists of a Numbering Plan Digit (NPD) and a 7-digit ANI, where
1087 the value of the NPD represents one of four NPAs as well as an indication
1088 whether the ANI should be displayed using a steady display or a flashing
1089 display.
1090  An E-MF interface supports the delivery of a 10-digit ANI with two ANI
1091 II digits and, optionally, a second 10-digit number (typically a pANI that
1092 represents the cell site/sector from which a legacy wireless call
1093 originated); the II digits indicate how the ANI should be displayed (i.e.,
1094 steady or flashing).
1095  If the PSAP supports a Traditional MF interface or an E-MF interface that only
1096 supports the delivery of one 10-digit number, the LPG will determine, based on
1097 per-PSAP provisioning, whether callback information or location information
1098 (i.e., a location key) should be signaled to the PSAP.
1099  If the LPG determines that callback information is to be signaled to the PSAP, the
1100 LPG will inspect the callback information to see if it is in the form of (or easily
1101 converted to) a 10-digit NANP number.
1102  If callback information is to be delivered, and the callback information
1103 received in incoming SIP signaling is in the form of (or easily converted to) a
1104 10-digit NANP number, and the NPA associated with that number is one that
1105 is appropriate for the target PSAP (i.e., one that can be mapped to an NPD
1106 digit), the LPG will use the received information to populate the 10-digit ANI
1107 signaled via E-MF or the NPD + 7-digit ANI sent via Traditional MF to the
1108 PSAP.
1109  If callback information is to be delivered, and the callback information
1110 received in the incoming SIP signaling is NOT in the form of (or easily
1111 converted to) a 10-digit NANP number (or if the callback information is in
1112 the form of a 10-digit NANP number, but the NPA is not one that can be
Page 37 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1113 mapped to an NPD that is supported by a legacy PSAP via a Traditional MF
1114 interface), the LPG will generate a substitute ANI digit string of the form
1115 NPA-511-XXXX (for the E-MF case) or NPD + 511-XXXX (for the
1116 Traditional MF case, where the NPD is associated with an NPA that is
1117 appropriate for the target PSAP).
1118  If the PSAP supports an E-MF interface, it supports the delivery of two 10-digit
1119 numbers and either callback or location information is not available, the LPG will
1120 signal the digits “000-9-1-1-0000” for the missing information.
1121  If the LPG determines that location information is to be signaled to the PSAP, the
1122 LPG will generate a location key that is also of the form NPA-511-XXXX (for
1123 the Enhanced MF case) or NPD + 511-XXXX (for the Traditional MF case).
1124 C. The LPG delivers the emergency call to the PSAP using Traditional or E-MF
1125 signaling, as appropriate for the target PSAP.
1126 D. The PSAP uses the information provided via MF (i.e., the ANI and/or location key)
1127 to query the LPG as if it were a legacy ALI system.
1128 E. If the location information received by the LPG in incoming SIP signaling is
1129 “by-reference”, the LPG will send a HELD dereference request to the element
1130 identified in the location reference (i.e., the LS in an IP originating network, or an
1131 LNG or an LSRG) to obtain a location value.
1132  Note that this step will be omitted if the location information received by the
1133 LPG in incoming SIP signaling was “by-value”.
1134 F. The LPG sends a response to the ALI request from the legacy PSAP that contains
1135 location information, callback information, and other non-location information (e.g.,
1136 class of service, Service Provider contact information).
1137
1138 6.2 Transitional NG9-1-1 Service Architectures to Support Interconnection
1139 with Legacy PSAPs that are Served by Legacy Selective Routers
1140 An emergency call that is routed via an NG Emergency Services Network and is destined for a
1141 legacy PSAP that is connected to an SR must traverse an LSRG on the egress side of the NG
1142 Emergency Services Network. Upon receiving an emergency session request from an NG
1143 Emergency Services Network, the LSRG will analyze the signaled information and apply
1144 NG9-1-1-specific processing to identify the outgoing trunk group over which the call will be
1145 delivered to the interconnected legacy SR, and to ensure that the information delivered to the
1146 legacy SR is in an acceptable format. The LSRG will select the outgoing route to the SR based
1147 on the destination PSAP number/address provided in the incoming SIP signaling from the NG
1148 Emergency Services Network. The LSRG will maintain a mapping between the PSAP URI
1149 delivered to it in incoming SIP signaling and the Directory Number (DN) of the corresponding
1150 PSAP on the SR. The LSRG delivers the emergency call to the SR over an SS7-supported
1151 tandem-to-tandem trunk group. SS7 interfaces to legacy SRs assume that the PSAP DN and the
1152 callback information and/or location keys (i.e., pANIs) signaled to the legacy SR will be in the
1153 form of a 10-digit NANP number. It is possible that some emergency originations (e.g., from
1154 VoIP callers) will contain callback information that is not in the form of (or easily converted to)
Page 38 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1155 a 10-digit NANP number. If callback information is to be delivered to the SR (i.e., in the SS7
1156 Calling Party Number parameter) and it is not in the form of (or easily converted to) a 10-digit
1157 NANP number, the LSRG will perform a mapping from the non-NANP callback information to
1158 a pseudo callback number that is appropriate for the destination PSAP.
1159 The LSRG will also need to be able to pass a key to the location information associated with the
1160 emergency call to the SR, either by itself (i.e., populated in the SS7 Calling Party Number
1161 parameter) or in addition to the callback information (where the callback information will be
1162 populated in the SS7 Calling Party Number parameter and the location key will be populated in
1163 the SS7 Generic Digits Parameter). An egress LSRG must therefore also generate a 10-digit
1164 pANI to associate with the location information received in incoming signaling from the NG
1165 Emergency Services Network. (Note that the same digit string can be used to represent both the
1166 callback and location information.)
1167 If the SR receives both a callback number (or pseudo callback number) and a pANI (associated
1168 with the location information), it will use per-PSAP provisioning to determine what will be
1169 signaled forward to the PSAP. The PSAP will use the information received in incoming
1170 signaling to query an ALI system to obtain caller location for the call. The ALI will steer the
1171 location query back to the LSRG, in the same way as it would steer a location query to an
1172 MPC/GMLC in a wireless originating network. To support location delivery to legacy PSAPs
1173 that are served by legacy SRs, the LSRG must support the interface protocol used by the
1174 interconnected ALI system to query an MPC/GMLC. The location key used in the query to the
1175 LSRG will be the pANI (possibly in combination with the callback number/pseudo callback
1176 number) created by the LSRG for the emergency call. If the location information received from
1177 the NG Emergency Services Network is in the form of a location-by-value, the LSRG will be
1178 responsible for returning that location information, as well as the callback number and other
1179 non-location information, in the response to the ALI system. If the location information is in the
1180 form of a civic location/street address, the LSRG must ensure that location returned in the ALI
1181 response is in a format that is acceptable to the ALI system/PSAP. If the location information
1182 received by the NG Emergency Services Network is in the form of a location-by-reference, the
1183 LSRG will first have to dereference the location reference to obtain the location value to be
1184 returned in the response to the ALI system. Once again, if the location value is in the form of a
1185 civic location/street address, the LSRG will have to ensure that location returned in the ALI
1186 response is in an acceptable format.
1187 Figure 6 provides a High-Level Functional Architecture diagram illustrating how emergency
1188 calls are processed using a transitional architecture involving an egress LSRG.

1192
1193 An emergency call originates in an IP originating network or legacy originating network and
1194 proceeds as described in the previous diagrams to the point where the routing URI associated
1195 with the PSAP is obtained by a Routing Proxy. The emergency call, and associated data, is then
1196 processed as follows:
1197 A. The routing proxy forwards the emergency call/session request (with the same
1198 callback and location information as it received in incoming SIP signaling) via a BCF
1199 toward the legacy PSAP identified in the URI received in the response from the
1200 Routing Database.
1201  In this scenario, the target PSAP is a legacy PSAP that is still being served by
1202 a Selective Router.
1203  The routing proxy forwards the SIP INVITE message to an LSRG that is
1204 appropriate for the PSAP URI (i.e., an LSRG to which the PSAP URI
1205 obtained from the routing database resolves).
1206 B. Upon receiving the emergency session request from the routing proxy, the LSRG
1207 performs the following functions:
1208  The LSRG determines, based on provisioning, what information should be
1209 sent over the SS7-supported trunk group to the SR that serves the target
1210 PSAP.
Page 40 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1211  The trunk group supports the delivery of a single 10-digit number
1212 (i.e., which will be populated in the SS7 Calling Party Number
1213 parameter) in addition to the PSAP directory number sent in the SS7
1214 Called Party Number parameter.
1215  The trunk group supports the delivery of two 10-digit numbers (i.e.,
1216 one of which will be populated in the SS7 Calling Party Number
1217 parameter and the other in the SS7 Generic Digits Parameter) in
1218 addition to the PSAP directory number sent in the SS7 Called Party
1219 Number parameter.
1220  In either case, the LSRG will associate an ESN-appropriate pANI with the
1221 location information received in incoming SIP signaling from the routing
1222 proxy.
1223  If the LSRG determines that callback information is to be signaled to the SR
1224 along with the pANI/location key, the LSRG will inspect the callback
1225 information to see if it is in the form of (or easily converted to) a 10-digit
1226 NANP number.
1227  If callback information is to be delivered, and the callback information
1228 received in incoming SIP signaling is in the form of (or easily
1229 converted to) a 10-digit NANP number, the LSRG will use the
1230 received information to populate the SS7 Calling Party Number
1231 parameter.
1232  If callback information is to be delivered, and the callback information
1233 received in the incoming SIP signaling is NOT in the form of (or
1234 easily converted to) a 10-digit NANP number, the LSRG will generate
1235 a “pseudo callback number” (which may have the same value as the
1236 pANI described above) to populate in the SS7 Calling Party Number
1237 parameter.
1238 C. The LSRG routes the call to the legacy Selective Router over an SS7-supported trunk
1239 group.
1240 D. The Selective Router queries the SRDB (not shown) to obtain an ESN for the call
1241 (for potential use in Selective Transfer), and delivers the emergency call to the PSAP
1242 using Traditional or Enhanced MF signaling, as appropriate for the target PSAP.
1243 E. The PSAP uses the information provided via MF (i.e., the ANI and/or location key)
1244 to query the legacy ALI system.
1245 F. The ALI system steers the location query to the LSRG (as if it were an
1246 MPC/GMLC), using either the E2 protocol or MLP.
1247 G. If the location information received by the LSRG in incoming SIP signaling is
1248 “by-reference”, the LSRG will send a HELD dereference request to the element
1249 identified in the location reference (i.e., the LS in an IP originating network, or an
1250 LNG) to obtain a location value.
1251 Note that this step will be omitted if the location information received by the LSRG in incoming
1252 SIP signaling was “by-value”.
Page 41 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1253 H. The LSRG sends a response to the ALI that contains location information, callback
1254 information, and other non-location information (e.g., class of service, Service
1255 Provider contact information) as appropriate for the E2/MLP interface.
1256 I. The ALI sends a response to the PSAP that contains location information, callback
1257 information, and other non-location information, as appropriate for the interface
1258 protocol used between the ALI and the PSAP.
7 IMS Emergency Procedures for IMS Origination and
1259
ESInet/Legacy Selective Router Termination
1260
1261 ATIS-0700015 [2] defines the functional interconnection of an originating IMS network to
1262 Emergency Services Networks, as shown in Figure 7. The scope of this standard is to identify,
1263 and adapt as necessary, 3GPP Common IMS emergency procedures for applicability in North
1264 America to support emergency communications originating from an IMS subscriber (fixed,
1265 nomadic, or mobile) and delivered to an Emergency Services IP network (ESInet) or to a legacy
1266 Selective Router.
1267
1268
1269
1270 Figure 7 – ATIS 0700015 IMS Interconnection Architecture
1271 In the North American architecture, the emphasis is on the relationship between the originating
1272 IMS network and the interconnected Emergency Services Network, rather than the PSAP. For
1273 example, emergency calls destined for legacy PSAPs may be directed from the originating IMS
Page 42 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1274 network to a Selective Router in a legacy Emergency Services Network or to an Emergency
1275 Services IP Network (ESInet) that hosts legacy PSAPs. Emergency calls destined for IP-capable
1276 PSAPs are directed from the originating IMS network to an ESInet. Thus, in North America, it is
1277 the capabilities of the interconnected Emergency Services Network that influence call handling
1278 within the IMS originating network, rather than the specific capabilities of the PSAP to which
1279 the call will ultimately be delivered.
1280 For calls to a NENA i3 ESInet, calls may be delivered with the location of the caller (referred to
1281 as location-by-value [LbyV]) or a location reference URI or Reference Identifier (referred to as
1282 location-by-reference [LbyR]). If the call is delivered to the ESInet with location information
1283 that is in the form of a Reference Identifier, routing elements within the ESInet will use the
1284 Reference Identifier to query the originating IMS Network for the routing location. NG/i3
1285 PSAPs (or gateways on behalf of legacy PSAPs) will also use the Reference Identifier to obtain
1286 caller location after the call has reached the PSAP.
1287 If the originating IMS Network needs to acquire location information, the Location Retrieval
1288 Function (LRF) within the originating IMS network may do so by accessing a Location Server
1289 (LS). The characteristics of the LS may differ based upon the class of service. For example, for
1290 mobile calls, the originating IMS Network may query location determination equipment via the
1291 LS.
1292 Once the originating IMS Network has obtained location, it must select the appropriate
1293 Emergency Services Network to deliver the call to. The LRF may access an integrated Routing
1294 Determination Function (RDF) or interrogate an external RDF to obtain routing information for
1295 the emergency call.
1296 7.1 IMS Functional Elements
1297 The following definitions describe the IMS Functional Elements shown in Figure 7 above. See
1298 ATIS-0700015 [2] for further details about the elements and interfaces illustrated in Figure 7.
1299 User Equipment (UE)
1300 The UE initiates the emergency session establishment request.
1301 Proxy Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF)
1302 The P-CSCF receives the emergency session establishment request from the UE, detects that it is
1303 an emergency session request, and forwards it to the E-CSCF. Based on the operator policy, in
1304 some situations the P-CSCF may forward the emergency session establishment request to the
1305 S-CSCF.
1306 Emergency Call Session Control Function (E-CSCF)
1307 The E-CSCF receives the emergency session establishment request from the P-CSCF, obtains

8 Demarcation Points that may be used in Assessing Risks and
1334
Defining Metrics
1335
1336 In an NG9-1-1 environment, the originating network only has visibility into the demarcation
1337 points at the boundaries of the Emergency Services Network through which it is interconnected,
1338 but not directly into the PSAP. The Emergency Services Network (including the LPG) has
1339 visibility directly into the PSAP for call delivery, including the delivery of location keys and
1340 callback numbers in call setup signaling. Only the LPG is aware of what data is exchanged
1341 between the PSAP and the external data sources (e.g., Location Information Server [LIS], LRF,
1342 etc.). In NG9-1-1 scenarios, the originating network will be able to determine whether location
1343 and a callback number are delivered to the Emergency Services Network, but will not be able to
Page 44 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1344 determine whether, or in what form, that information is presented to the PSAP. This section
1345 analyzes where failures in call and data delivery may be detected in an NG9-1-1 environment.
1346 Figure 8 illustrates the NG9-1-1 environment where calls from legacy networks are delivered to
1347 an LNG to be routed toward the PSAP, and IP-based originating networks (e.g., IMS and
1348 generic IP-based networks) deliver native SIP requests to the Emergency Services Network to be
1349 routed toward the PSAP. The figure illustrates potential points of demarcation (e.g., Demarc 1)
1350 that denote the logical boundaries of responsibility between providers. The figure applies the
1351 concept of demarcation points, as defined in NENA-INF-003 [9], to the NG9-1-1 environment.
1352 It also shows interfaces between different network elements: 1) between an originating network
1353 and the Emergency Services Network; 2) within the Emergency Services Network; and 3)
1354 between the Emergency Services Network and the PSAP CPE (associated with both legacy and
1355 NG9-1-1 PSAPs).

1359 8.1 Demarcation Points
1360 Figure 8 illustrates demarcation points between network providers that denote where
1361 responsibility lies for managing and reporting failures.
1362 Demarc 1
1363 This demarcation point applies if the LNG is operated by the NG9-1-1 Service Provider. It is
1364 between the LNG and a legacy originating network routing function (e.g., a Local Switch or
1365 MSC) and is at the “port” of the LNG.
1366 Demarc 2
1367 This demarcation point applies if the LNG is operated by the NG9-1-1 Service Provider. It is
1368 between LNG and the legacy wireless originating network location server (i.e., MPC/GMLC).
1369 The originating carriers provide a connection to the data centers that host the LNG.
1370 Demarc 3
1371 This demarcation point is between the IP-based originating network Border Control Function
1372 and the Emergency Services Network Border Control Function for routing control. If the LNG is
1373 operated by any entity besides the NG9-1-1 Service Provider (e.g., the Originating Service
1374 Provider), this demarcation point is between the LNG and the Emergency Services Network
1375 BCF. The demarcation is at the ingress of the Emergency Services Network BCF.
1376 Demarc 4
1377 This demarcation point applies if the LNG is operated by any entity besides the NG9-1-1
1378 Service Provider. If the location and/or the Additional Data is sent by reference, the ESRP will
1379 query the LNG for it. The demarcation is at the ESRP (note firewalls are included in the path,
1380 but not shown).
1381 Demarc 5
1382 This demarcation point is between the ESRP and the location server in an IP-based originating
1383 network (e.g., LIS or LRF) and/or the Additional Data Repository (ADR) in an IP-based
1384 originating network. The demarcation is at the ESRP (note firewalls are included in the path, but
1385 not shown).
1386 Demarc 6
1387 This demarcation point applies if the LPG is not operated by the NG9-1-1 Service Provider. The
1388 demarcation point is at the ingress of the LPG (note that the LPG may have an additional BCF,
1389 not shown).
1390 Demarc 7
1391 This demarcation point applies if the LPG and LNG are not operated by the same provider. The
1392 LPG would query the LNG for location and Additional Data if they were provided by reference.
1393 Demarc 8
1394 This demarcation point is between the LPG and the location server (e.g., LIS or LRF) and/or the
1395 ADR in an IP-based originating network. The demarcation is at LPG (note firewalls are included
1396 in the path, but not shown).
Page 46 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1397 Demarc 9
1398 This demarcation point is between the LPG and legacy PSAP to deliver calls over TDM circuits.
1399 The demarcation is at the PSAP CPE. This demarcation point applies if the LPG is operated by
1400 the NG9-1-1 Service Provider.
1401 Demarc 10
1402 This demarcation point is between the LPG and legacy PSAP to provide legacy ALI-equivalent
1403 data (location information and additional data). The demarcation is at the PSAP CPE. This
1404 demarcation point applies if the LPG is operated by the NG9-1-1 Service Provider.
1405 Demarc 11
1406 This demarcation point is between ESRP (via the BCF) and the NG9-1-1 PSAP to deliver the
1407 call request. It is at the PSAP CPE (note a BCF may be included at the PSAP, but not shown).
1408 Demarc 12
1409 If the location and/or the Additional Data is sent by reference, the NG9-1-1 PSAP will query the
1410 LNG for it. The demarcation is at NG9-1-1 PSAP (note firewalls are included in the path, but
1411 not shown).
1412 Demarc 13
1413 This demarcation point is between the NG9-1-1 PSAP and the location server (e.g., LIS or LRF)
1414 in an IP-based originating network and/or the ADR in an IP-based originating network. The
1415 demarcation is at NG9-1-1 PSAP (note firewalls are included in the path, but not shown).
1416 8.2 Minimum Demarcation Points for the Typical NG9-1-1 Configuration
1417 Figure 8 illustrates all of the possible demarcation points in an NG9-1-1 configuration that does
1418 not include LSRGs. In configurations being deployed today it is typical for the gateway
1419 functions (LNG and LPG) to be the responsibility of the NG9-1-1 Service Provider. In that case
1420 the minimum number of demarcation points required to evaluate reporting criteria are shown
1421 below.

9 Transitional Architecture Involving Legacy Selective Router
1432
Gateway
1433
1434 As described in Section 5.2.2, the LSRG supports the delivery of emergency calls that originate
1435 in networks that are served by legacy SRs and are destined for PSAPs that are served by NG
1436 Emergency Services Networks, as well as the delivery of emergency calls routed via an NG
1437 Emergency Services Network to legacy PSAPs that are served by legacy SRs. The LSRG also
1438 facilitates transfers of calls between PSAPs that are served by legacy SRs and PSAPs that are
1439 served by NG Emergency Services Networks. An LSRG may reside on either the ingress or the
1440 egress side of an NG Emergency Services Network. While an LSRG is generally assumed to be
1441 operated by the same entity as operates the SR, there are demarcation points beyond those
1442 described in Section 0 that are associated with transitional architectures that include LSRGs.
1443 These demarcation points influence the visibility that originating network providers and NG9-1-
1444 1SSPs have into potential failures that may occur with respect to emergency call delivery,
1445 location information delivery, and callback information delivery, when a transitional architecture
1446 involving LSRGs is used.
1447 9.1 Ingress LSRG
1448 In a transitional architecture where originating networks are served by legacy SRs and
1449 emergency calls are routed to NG Emergency Services Networks via an ingress LSRG, the
1450 amount of visibility that the originating network provider and NG9-1-1SSP have into
1451 downstream elements/networks will be similar to architectures involving an LNG, where the
1452 LNG is operated by the NG9-1-1SSP. A transitional architecture involving an ingress LSRG,
1453 with the associated demarcation points, is depicted below.

Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1456 Demarcation Points for Ingress LSRG
1457 Figure 9 illustrates demarcation points between network providers that denote where
1458 responsibility lies for managing and reporting failures. Only the demarcation points that are
1459 unique to a transitional architecture that includes an ingress LSRG are defined below. See
1460 Section 0 for descriptions of the other demarcation points included in this figure.
1461 9.1.1.1 Demarc 14
1462 This demarcation point is between the ingress LSRG and the NG Emergency Services Network
1463 Border Control Function (BCF) and supports call delivery to the NG Emergency Services
1464 Network. The demarcation point is at the ingress to the Emergency Services Network BCF.
1465 9.1.1.2 Demarc 15
1466 If location and/or Additional Data is sent by the LSRG with the emergency call “by-reference”,
1467 the ESRP in the NG Emergency Services Network will send a dereference request to the LSRG
1468 to obtain the location/Additional Data “by-value”. The demarcation point that supports this
1469 dereferencing is at the ESRP (note firewalls are included in the path, but not shown).
1470 9.1.1.3 Demarc 16
1471 This demarcation point applies if the architecture involves an LPG as well as an ingress LSRG.
1472 This demarcation point is used by the LPG to request the dereferencing of location and/or
1473 Additional Data if the location and/or Additional Data were provided by the ingress LSRG “by-
1474 reference”. The demarcation point is at the LPG (note firewalls are included in the path, but not
1475 shown).
1476 9.1.1.4 Demarc 17
1477 If the location and/or the Additional Data is sent by the ingress LSRG “by-reference”, the NG9-
1478 1-1 PSAP will send a dereference request to the LSRG to obtain the location and/or Additional
1479 Data “by-value”. The demarcation point is at NG9-1-1 PSAP (note firewalls are included in the
1480 path, but not shown).
1481 9.2 Egress LSRG
1482 In a transitional architecture where an emergency call routed via an NG Emergency Services
1483 Network is delivered via an egress LSRG to a PSAP that is served by a legacy SR, the amount
1484 of visibility that the originating network provider and NG9-1-1SSP have into downstream
1485 elements/networks will be similar to architectures involving an LPG, where the LPG is operated
1486 by an entity other than the NG9-1-1SSP. A transitional architecture involving an egress LSRG,
1487 with the associated demarcation points, is depicted below.

1493 Figure 10 illustrates demarcation points between network providers that denote where
1494 responsibility lies for managing and reporting failures. Only the demarcation points that are
1495 unique to a transitional architecture involving an egress LSRG are defined below. See Section 0
1496 for descriptions of the other demarcation points included in this figure.
1497 9.2.1.1 Demarc 18
1498 This demarcation point is between the NG Emergency Services Network Border Control
1499 Function and the egress LSRG to support call delivery to a PSAP that is served by a legacy SR.
Page 50 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1500 The demarcation point is at the ingress side of the LSRG (note that the LSRG may have an
1501 additional BCF, not shown).
1502 9.2.1.2 Demarc 19
1503 If location and/or Additional Data is generated by an LNG and delivered to the egress LSRG
1504 with the emergency call “by-reference”, the egress LSRG will send a dereference request to the
1505 LNG to obtain the location/additional data “by-value”. The demarcation point that supports this
1506 dereferencing is at the egress LSRG (note firewalls are included in the path, but not shown).
1507 9.2.1.3 Demarc 20
1508 This demarcation point is between the egress LSRG and the location server (e.g., LIS or LRF)
1509 and/or the ADR in an IP-based originating network. This demarcation point applies if the
1510 emergency call originates in an IP-based originating network and location and/or Additional
1511 Data is delivered to the egress LSRG “by-reference”. This demarcation point is used by the
1512 egress LSRG to request the dereferencing of location and/or Additional Data. The demarcation
1513 point is at the egress LSRG (note firewalls are included in the path, but not shown).
10 Architectural Analysis
1514
1515 This section analyzes the transitional and end-state NG9-1-1 architectures described above from
1516 the perspective of call delivery failures, location delivery failures and callback information
1517 delivery failures, to identify which failures can be identified by various stakeholder roles. As
1518 discussed in Section 3.3.1, while the focus of the analysis is call delivery, location delivery, and
1519 callback information delivery failures, the analysis also considers failures related to the delivery
1520 of additional non-location data, such as class of service information and Service Provider contact
1521 information, that is typically delivered to PSAPs from ALI systems today. In this sense, the
1522 analysis examines transitional and end-state-NG9-1-1 architectures in terms of the call delivery
1523 failure and ANI/ALI delivery failure metrics applied to E9-1-1 architectures to determine the
1524 impact of NG9-1-1 on the ability of the different NG9-1-1 stakeholders to detect potentially
1525 service-affecting failures.
1526 While not explicitly depicted in the figures in Sections 8 and 9, this analysis assumes that the
1527 transitional and end-state architectures described in this document deploy redundancy to
1528 improve the overall reliability of the architectures. As mentioned previously in this Report, the
1529 demarcation points are at the boundaries between the Emergency Services Network and other
1530 partner networks with which they interconnect. It is assumed in this Report that all network
1531 elements and transport facilities are deployed with redundancy. Network redundancy is
1532 primarily implemented in Emergency Services Network infrastructure to provide an alternate
1533 path for network communications. It serves as a mechanism for quickly swapping network
1534 operations onto redundant infrastructure in the event of an error within a network element or
1535 transmission path. Typically, network redundancy is achieved through the addition of alternate
1536 network paths, which are implemented through redundant standby network elements, routers and
1537 switches. When the primary path is unavailable, the alternate path can be instantly deployed to
1538 ensure continuity of network services. As such the switching to a backup configuration, in
1539 general, does not cause service degradation.

Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1540 10.1 NG9-1-1 Failure Considerations – All IP End-State
1541 In an end state (all IP) NG9-1-1 environment, the originating network has limited visibility into
1542 the Emergency Services Network. The visibility exists up to Demarc Point 3 for call delivery
1543 and for location/Additional Data delivery where that information is signaled forward “by value”.
1544 For dereferencing of location information and Additional Data that was signaled forward by the
1545 originating network “by reference”, the originating network has visibility up to Demarc Point 5
1546 for dereference requests sent by an ESRP, and up to Demarc Point 13 for dereference requests
1547 sent by an i3 PSAP. The originating network does not have visibility into the PSAP for call
1548 delivery or for information (i.e., location or Additional Data) delivery where that information
1549 was signaled by the originating network “by value”. The NG Emergency Services Network has
1550 visibility directly into the PSAP (i.e., via Demarc Point 11) for call delivery, including the
1551 delivery of location and Additional Data (“by reference” or “by value”), as well as callback
1552 information, via SIP based call setup signaling, but it is not aware of what data may be
1553 exchanged between the PSAP and the originating network (i.e., via Demarc Point 13). This
1554 section analyzes where failures in call and data delivery may be detected in an NG9-1-1
1555 environment.
1556 Call Delivery Failures
1557 10.1.1.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network
1558 An IP-based originating network will be expected to monitor for transport alarms associated
1559 with IP connections to the NG Emergency Services Network. An IP originating network may
1560 also detect emergency call delivery failures via call failure indications/messages received via
1561 signaling. Based on the signaling indications received, the originating network may be able to
1562 determine the nature and location of the failure.
1563 10.1.1.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Provider
1564 An NG9-1-1 System Service Provider (NG9-1-1SSP) will be able to detect when IP connectivity
1565 to the PSAP, or IP connectivity between the first routing element in the NG Emergency Services
1566 Network and other downstream network elements, is unavailable, resulting in alternate routing
1567 of the emergency call or PSAP isolation. The NG9-1-1SSP will be responsible for monitoring IP
1568 connections for transport alarms. Where appropriate, heartbeats may be used to verify the
1569 availability of network facilities. NG9-1-1SSPs should provide the means for capturing network
1570 traffic, generating alarms, and producing other metrics for monitoring and troubleshooting
1571 outages within NG Emergency Services Networks, as well as those impacting the ability of an
1572 NG Emergency Services Network to deliver calls to the target PSAP.
1573 Location Delivery Failures
1574 10.1.2.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
1575 IP-based originating network providers will have the ability to determine whether or not location
1576 information is included in the outgoing SIP signaling sent to an NG Emergency Services
1577 Network. If the originating network provider fails to include location information (by-value or
Page 52 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1578 by-reference) in outgoing SIP signaling to an NG Emergency Services Network, it can conclude
1579 that location information was not delivered to the PSAP.
1580 If the IP-based originating network provider is serving fixed customers, and location information
1581 is included in outgoing SIP signaling sent to the NG Emergency Services Network, the location
1582 information delivered to the NG Emergency Services Network (i.e., via Demarc Point 3) with
1583 the call will typically be in the form of location-by-value. An originating network provider that
1584 delivers location-by-value to an NG Emergency Services Network will not be able to determine
1585 whether or not that location information is subsequently delivered to the PSAP.
1586 IP-based originating network providers that serve mobile callers will be responsible for
1587 providing caller location dynamically per call. To support the dynamic delivery of location
1588 information associated with emergency calls originated by mobile users, the IP-based
1589 originating network will provide location-by-reference in the SIP signaling delivered to the NG
1590 Emergency Services Network (via Demarc Point 3). The originating network provider must also
1591 support location dereference requests from routing elements in the NG Emergency Services
1592 Network (via Demarc Point 5) as well as NG PSAPs (via Demarc Point 13). If an IP-based
1593 originating network receives a dereference request from an NG PSAP, it can conclude that the
1594 location-by-reference that it signaled to the NG Emergency Services Network was successfully
1595 delivered to the NG PSAP. In addition, the IP-based originating network will be able to detect
1596 any failures to provide location-by-value in response to location dereference requests from NG
1597 Emergency Services Network elements or NG PSAPs.
1598 10.1.2.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
1599 Routing elements in an NG Emergency Services Network will be able to detect failures in the
1600 delivery of location information to the NG Emergency Services Network. If the IP-based
1601 originating network fails to provide location information to the NG Emergency Services
1602 Network in the SIP signaling associated with an emergency call, the NG Emergency Services
1603 Network will perform default routing of the emergency call. The NG Emergency Services
1604 Network will be able to determine whether location information received from the originating
1605 network (“by-value” or “by-reference”) with the call is successfully delivered to the NG PSAP.
1606 When a routing element in an NG Emergency Services Network receives location-by-reference,
1607 it will launch a dereference request to an element in the IP originating network. The NG9-1-
1608 1SSP will be able to detect failures in the dereference process if a routing element in the NG
1609 Emergency Services Network does not receive a location-by-value in response to the location
1610 dereference request.
1611 Callback Information Delivery Failures
1612 10.1.3.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
1613 IP-based originating network providers have the ability to determine whether outgoing signaling
1614 delivered to an NG Emergency Services Network (via Demarc Point 3) includes callback
1615 information, but they will not be able to detect whether the callback information was
1616 successfully delivered to the PSAP.
Page 53 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1617 10.1.3.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
1618 NG9-1-1SSPs will be able to determine whether callback information was received in incoming
1619 signaling from an IP originating network, and will also be able detect whether callback
1620 information was successfully delivered to the PSAP (i.e., via Demarc Point 11).
1621 10.2 NG9-1-1 Failure Considerations – Interworking Architecture Involving
1622 Legacy Network Gateway
1623 In an interworking architecture where a legacy originating network interfaces to an LNG that
1624 resides between the originating network and the NG Emergency Services Network, the amount
1625 of visibility that the originating network has into downstream elements/networks will depend on
1626 what entity has responsibility for the LNG and where the demarcation points are drawn. If the
1627 LNG is operated by the NG9-1-1 System Service Provider, then the originating network will
1628 only have visibility into what is delivered to the LNG to support call delivery (i.e., via Demarc
1629 Point 1) and location/Additional Data delivery (i.e., via Demarc Point 2). Call delivery from the
1630 originating network to the LNG will be via SS7 or MF trunk groups, with location delivered in
1631 the form of a 10-digit location key (i.e., calling number/ANI, ESRK, ESRD). If the LNG is
1632 operated by the originating network provider, then the originating network will also have
1633 visibility into the Emergency Services Network for call delivery (i.e., via Demarc Point 3) and
1634 for location/Additional Data delivery (i.e., via Demarc Point 4). Using this type of arrangement,
1635 call delivery from the LNG to the Emergency Services Network will be via SIP, with location
1636 and Additional Data delivered either “by value” or “by reference”.
1637 If the NG9-1-1 System Service Provider operates the LNG, the originating network will have
1638 visibility into the LNG (i.e., via Demarc Point 2) to support location queries (using legacy
1639 protocols such as E2 or MLP) generated by the LNG to MPCs/GMLCs to obtain location and
1640 other information associated with legacy wireless emergency originations. If the originating
1641 network provider operates the LNG, the originating network provider will have visibility into
1642 the ESRP in the NG Emergency Services Network (i.e., via Demarc Point 4) and the i3 PSAP
1643 (i.e., via Demarc Point 13) for dereferencing of location information and Additional Data that
1644 was signaled forward by the LNG “by-reference”. Regardless of which network provider is
1645 responsible for operating the LNG, the originating network will not have visibility into the
1646 PSAP for call delivery or for information (i.e., location or Additional Data) delivery where that
1647 information was signaled by the originating network “by-value”. The entity that is responsible
1648 for operating the LNG will however have visibility into whether location or Additional Data was
1649 successfully delivered to the i3 PSAP “by reference” if the LNG receives a dereference request
1650 from the i3 PSAP (i.e., via Demarc 13).
1651 The NG Emergency Services Network will have visibility directly into the PSAP (i.e., via
1652 Demarcation Point 11) for call delivery, including the delivery of location and Additional Data
1653 (“by-reference” or “by value”), as well as callback information, via SIP-based call setup
1654 signaling. This section analyzes where failures in call and data delivery may be detected in an
1655 interworking environment where the service architecture includes an LNG.
1656 Call Delivery Failures
Page 54 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1657 10.2.1.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
1658 A legacy originating network will be expected to monitor for transport alarms associated with
1659 SS7 or MF trunk groups to the LNG. If the originating network provider is also responsible for
1660 operating the LNG, the originating network will also be expected to monitor for transport alarms
1661 associated with IP connections to the NG Emergency Services Network. A legacy originating
1662 network may also detect emergency call delivery failures via call failure indications/messages
1663 received from the LNG via MF/SS7 signaling. Based on the signaling indications received, the
1664 originating network may be able to determine the nature and location of the failure. If the
1665 originating network provider is also responsible for operating the LNG, the originating network
1666 provider will also detect call delivery failure indications received by the LNG via SIP signaling.
1667 10.2.1.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
1668 As for the all-IP end-state configuration, an NG9-1-1SSP will be able to detect when IP
1669 connectivity to the PSAP, or IP connectivity between the first routing element in the NG
1670 Emergency Services Network and other downstream network elements, is unavailable, resulting
1671 in alternate routing of the emergency call or PSAP isolation. The NG9-1-1SSP will be
1672 responsible for monitoring IP connections for transport and for capturing network traffic,
1673 generating alarms and producing other metrics for monitoring and troubleshooting outages
1674 within NG Emergency Services Networks, as well as those impacting the ability of an NG
1675 Emergency Services Network to deliver calls to the target PSAP.
1676 If the NG9-1-1SSP is also responsible for operating the LNG, the NG9-1-1SSP will also be able
1677 to detect any errors in the SS7/MF call delivery signaling from the originating network.
1678 Location Delivery Failures
1679 10.2.2.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
1680 Legacy originating network providers will have the ability to determine whether or not a calling
1681 number/ANI and/or a pANI (e.g., ESRK, ESRD) is included in the outgoing MF or SS7
1682 signaling sent to an LNG (i.e., via Demarc Point 1) with an emergency call. If the originating
1683 network provider fails to include a calling number/ANI and/or a pANI in outgoing SS7 or MF
1684 signaling to LNG, it can determine that location information was not delivered to the PSAP.
1685 If the originating network provider is also responsible for operating the LNG, the originating
1686 Service Provider will have the ability to determine whether or not location information is
1687 included in the outgoing SIP signaling sent by the LNG to an NG Emergency Services Network
1688 (i.e., via Demarc Point 3). If the originating network provider/LNG operator fails to include
1689 location information (by value or by reference) in outgoing SIP signaling to an NG Emergency
1690 Services Network, it can determine that location information was not delivered to the PSAP.
1691 If the originating network provider is serving fixed customers, and location information is
1692 included in outgoing SIP signaling sent by the originating network provider/LNG operator to the
1693 NG Emergency Services Network, the location information delivered to the NG Emergency
1694 Services Network (i.e., via Demarc Point 3) with the call will typically be in the form of location
1695 by value. An LNG that delivers location by value to an NG Emergency Services Network will
Page 55 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1696 not be able to determine whether or not that location information is subsequently delivered to the
1697 PSAP by the NG Emergency Services Network.
1698 Legacy wireless originating network providers that include a pANI in the SS7 or MF signaling
1699 sent to the LNG will be responsible for providing caller location when queried by an LNG (i.e.,
1700 via Demarc Point 2) using the E2 protocol or MLP. If the legacy wireless originating network
1701 receives a request for updated caller location from an LNG, it can assume that the NG
1702 PSAP/LPG received a location by reference associated with the emergency call. The legacy
1703 wireless originating network provider will be able to determine whether the location request
1704 from the LNG was processed successfully, but unless they also operate the LNG, they will not
1705 know whether the location information was successfully returned to the NG PSAP/LPG. If the
1706 legacy wireless originating network provider operates the LNG, it will be able to determine
1707 whether location information (by reference) was successfully provided by the LNG to the NG
1708 Emergency Services Network with the call using SIP signaling (i.e., via Demarc Point 3). An
1709 originating network provider that operates an LNG must also support location dereference
1710 requests from routing elements in the NG Emergency Services Network (via Demarc Point 4) as
1711 well as NG PSAPs (via Demarc Point 13). If an LNG receives a dereference request from an NG
1712 PSAP, it can conclude that that the location by reference that it signaled to the NG Emergency
1713 Services Network was successfully delivered to the NG PSAP. In addition, the LNG will be able
1714 to detect any failures to provide location by value in response to location dereference requests
1715 from NG Emergency Services Network elements or NG PSAPs.
1716 10.2.2.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
1717 Routing elements in an NG Emergency Services Network will be able to detect failures in the
1718 delivery of location information to the NG Emergency Services Network. If the LNG fails to
1719 provide location information to the NG Emergency Services Network in the SIP signaling
1720 associated with an emergency call, the NG Emergency Services Network will perform default
1721 routing of the emergency call. The NG9-1-1SSP will be able to determine whether location
1722 information received from the LNG (“by-value” or “by-reference”) with the call is successfully
1723 delivered to the NG PSAP (i.e., via Demarc 11) or the LPG (i.e., via Demarc Point 6).
1724 When a routing element in an NG Emergency Services Network receives location-by-reference
1725 from an LNG, it will launch a dereference request back to the LNG to obtain the routing
1726 location. The NG9-1-1SSP will be able to detect failures in the dereference process if a routing
1727 element in the NG Emergency Services Network does not receive a location-by-value in
1728 response to the location dereference request.
1729 If the NG9-1-1SSP is also responsible for operating the LNG, it will also have visibility into
1730 whether a location query initiated toward a legacy wireless network resulted in the successful
1731 return of location information, and whether location dereference requests from routing elements
1732 in the NG Emergency Services Network, NG PSAPs, or LPGs were successfully processed by
1733 the LNG.
1734 Callback Information Delivery Failures
Page 56 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1735 10.2.3.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
1736 Legacy wireline originating network providers and legacy wireless originating network
1737 providers that use the NCAS method have the ability to determine whether outgoing MF or SS7
1738 signaling delivered to an LNG (i.e., via Demarc 1) includes an MF ANI or SS7 Calling Party
1739 Number, but they will not be able to detect whether the callback information was successfully
1740 delivered to the PSAP. Legacy wireless originating network providers that use the WCM
1741 approach for emergency calls will be able to determine whether callback information is returned
1742 in response to an E2 or MLP request from an LNG (i.e., via Demarc Point 2).
1743 If the legacy originating network provider also operates the LNG, it will be able to determine
1744 whether the SIP signaling delivered to the Emergency Services Network (via Demarc Point 3)
1745 includes callback information, but they will not be able to detect whether the callback
1746 information was successfully delivered to the PSAP.
1747 10.2.3.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
1748 NG9-1-1SSPs will be able to determine whether callback information was received in incoming
1749 signaling from an LNG, and will also be able detect whether callback information was
1750 successfully delivered to an NG PSAP (i.e., via Demarc Point 11) or an LPG (i.e., via Demarc
1751 Point 6).
1752 If the NG9-1-1SSP is also responsible for operating the LNG, it will also have visibility into
1753 whether callback information was delivered in call setup signaling (i.e., in the form of an MF
1754 ANI or SS7 Calling Party Number via Demarc Point 1), or whether it was obtained as part of the
1755 location response from a legacy wireless originating network (i.e., via Demarc Point 2).
1756 10.3 NG9-1-1 Failure Considerations - Interworking Architecture Involving
1757 Legacy PSAP Gateway
1758 In an interworking architecture where a legacy PSAP interfaces to an LPG that resides between
1759 the legacy PSAP and the NG Emergency Services Network, the amount of visibility that the NG
1760 Emergency Services Network has into the PSAP will depend on what entity has responsibility
1761 for the LPG and where the demarcation points are drawn. If the LPG is operated by the PSAP
1762 (or a third party other than the NG Emergency Services Network provider), then the NG
1763 Emergency Services Network will only have visibility into what is delivered to the LPG to
1764 support call delivery (i.e., via Demarc Point 6), including the delivery of location and Additional
1765 Data (“by-reference” or “by value”), as well as callback information, via SIP-based call setup
1766 signaling. It will not have visibility into what the LPG delivers to the PSAP with the call. The
1767 NG Emergency Services Network will also not be aware of what data may be exchanged
1768 between the LPG (on behalf of the PSAP) and the originating network (i.e., via Demarc Point 8),
1769 or between the LPG and the LNG (i.e., via Demarc Point 7).
1770 If the LPG is operated by the provider of the NG Emergency Services Network (i.e., the NG9-1-
1771 1SSP), then in addition to having an awareness of the status of the IP connection between the
1772 NG Emergency Services Network and the LPG, and what information (e.g., callback
1773 information, location information “by-value” or “by-reference”, Additional Data “by value” or
1774 “by reference”) is delivered via SIP signaling to the LPG, the NG Emergency Services Network
Page 57 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1775 will have visibility directly into the PSAP (i.e., via Demarc Point 9) for call delivery. In this
1776 case, the NG9-1-1SSP will be aware of the status of the MF trunk group to the PSAP as well as
1777 what information is conveyed via Traditional MF or E-MF signaling between the LPG and the
1778 legacy PSAP. If the NG9-1-1SSP operates the LPG, then it will also have visibility into the
1779 delivery of location information and other additional data to the PSAP using legacy ALI
1780 query/response protocols (i.e., via Demarc Point 10). It will also be aware of whether or not
1781 dereference requests launched by the LPG toward the originating network (i.e., via Demarc
1782 Point 8) or toward an LNG (i.e., via Demarc Point 7) are successful in obtaining location
1783 information or Additional Data.
1784 This section analyzes where failures in call and data delivery may be detected in an interworking
1785 environment where the service architecture includes an LPG.
1786 Call Delivery Failures
1787 10.3.1.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network
1788 The ability for an IP-based originating network to detect call delivery failures in an architecture
1789 where emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs via an LPG will be the same as described
1790 in Section 10.1.1.1. The only difference will be that the SIP-based call failure
1791 indications/messages will come from the LPG rather than from an NG PSAP. Likewise, the
1792 ability for a legacy originating network to detect call delivery failures in an architecture where
1793 emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs via an LPG will be the same as described in
1794 Section 10.2.1.1, except that if the originating network provider is also the LNG operator, the
1795 originating network provider will receive SIP-based call delivery failure indications from the
1796 LPG rather than from an NG PSAP.
1797 10.3.1.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
1798 An NG9-1-1SSP will be able to detect when IP connectivity to the LPG is unavailable, the NG9-
1799 1-1SSP will be responsible for monitoring these IP connections for transport alarms. If the NG9-
1800 1-1SSP is also responsible for operating the LPG, then it will be able to detect when the MF
1801 (emergency message) trunks to the PSAP are unavailable, preventing calls from being delivered
1802 to the target legacy PSAP.
1803 Location Delivery Failures
1804 10.3.2.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network
1805 The ability for an IP-based originating network to detect location delivery failures in an
1806 architecture where emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs via an LPG will be the same
1807 as described in Section 10.1.2.1, with the following clarification. The originating network
1808 provider must also support location dereference requests from LPGs (via Demarc Point 8), as
1809 well as routing elements in the NG Emergency Services Network (via Demarc Point 5) and NG
1810 PSAPs (via Demarc Point 13). If an IP-based originating network receives a dereference request
1811 from an LPG, it can conclude that the location-by-reference that it signaled to the NG
1812 Emergency Services Network was successfully delivered to the LPG, but it will not have
1813 visibility into whether or not location is successfully delivered to the legacy PSAP. In addition,
Page 58 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1814 the IP-based originating network will be able to detect any failures to provide location-by-value
1815 in response to location dereference requests from LPGs.
1816 The ability for a legacy originating network to detect location delivery failures in an architecture
1817 where emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs via an LPG will be the same as described
1818 in Section 10.2.2.1, with the following clarification. An originating network provider that
1819 operates an LNG must support location dereference requests from LPGs (via Demarc Point 7),
1820 as well as from routing elements in the NG Emergency Services Network (via Demarc Point 4)
1821 and NG PSAPs (via Demarc Point 13). If an LNG receives a dereference request from an LPG,
1822 it can conclude that the location-by-reference that it signaled to the NG Emergency Services
1823 Network was successfully delivered to the LPG, but it will have no visibility into whether or not
1824 location information is successfully delivered to the legacy PSAP. The LNG will also be able to
1825 detect any failures to provide location-by-value in response to location dereference requests
1826 from LPGs.
1827 10.3.2.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Provider
1828 The ability for an NG9-1-1SSP to detect location delivery failures in an architecture where
1829 emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs via an LPG will be the same as described in
1830 Sections 10.1.2.2 and 10.2.2.2, with the following clarifications. The NG9-1-1SSP will be able
1831 to determine whether location information received from the IP originating network or LNG
1832 (“by-value” or “by-reference”) with the call is successfully delivered to the LPG (i.e., via
1833 Demarc Point 6), but will not be able to determine whether location information was
1834 successfully delivered to the legacy PSAP unless the NG9-1-1SSP also operates the LPG.
1835 If the NG9-1-1SSP is also responsible for operating the LPG, it will have visibility into whether
1836 a location dereference request initiated toward an originating network/LNG resulted in the
1837 successful return of location information to the LPG, and whether location information was
1838 successfully delivered to the legacy PSAP.
1839 Callback Information Delivery Failures
1840 10.3.3.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
1841 IP-based originating network providers will have the ability to determine whether outgoing
1842 signaling delivered to an NG Emergency Services Network (via Demarc Point 3) includes
1843 callback information, but they will not be able to detect whether the callback information was
1844 successfully delivered to the LPG or the PSAP.
1845 The ability for a legacy originating network to detect failures in the delivery of callback
1846 information in an architecture where emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs via an LPG
1847 will be the same as described in Section 10.2.3.1, with the following clarification. Legacy
1848 wireline originating network providers and legacy wireless originating network providers that
1849 use the NCAS method will be able to determine whether outgoing MF or SS7 signaling
1850 delivered to an LNG (i.e., via Demarc 1) includes an MF ANI or SS7 Calling Party Number, but
1851 they will not be able to detect whether the callback information was successfully delivered to the
1852 LPG or to the PSAP. If the legacy originating network provider also operates the LNG, it will be
1853 able to determine whether the SIP signaling delivered to the Emergency Services Network (via
Page 59 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1854 Demarc Point 3) includes callback information, but they will not be able to detect whether the
1855 callback information was successfully delivered to the LPG or to the PSAP.
1856 10.3.3.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
1857 NG9-1-1SSPs will be able to determine whether callback information was received in incoming
1858 signaling from an IP originating network or LNG, and will also be able detect whether callback
1859 information was successfully delivered to an LPG (i.e., via Demarc Point 6), but they will not be
1860 able to detect whether callback information was successfully delivered to the PSAP, unless the
1861 NG9-1-1SSP also operates the LPG. If the NG9-1-1SSP is also responsible for operating the
1862 LPG, it will have visibility into whether callback information was successfully delivered to the
1863 legacy PSAP.
1864 10.4 NG9-1-1 Failure Considerations - Transitional Architecture Involving
1865 LSRG
1866 Ingress Legacy Selective Router Gateway
1867 10.4.1.1 Call Delivery Failures
1868 10.4.1.1.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
1869 As in E9-1-1 architectures today, a legacy originating network will be expected to monitor for
1870 transport alarms associated with SS7 or MF trunk groups to the SR. A legacy originating
1871 network may also detect emergency call delivery failures via call failure indications/messages
1872 received from the SR via MF/SS7 signaling. Based on the signaling indications received (e.g.,
1873 the Cause Indicator parameter value in an SS7 Release message), the originating network may
1874 be able to determine the nature and location of the failure.
1875 10.4.1.1.2 Failures Detected by E9-1-1 System Service Providers
1876 Since the E9-1-1SSP is also expected to be responsible for operating the ingress LSRG, the E9-
1877 1-1SSP will also be expected to monitor for transport alarms associated with IP connections to
1878 the NG Emergency Services Network. The E9-1-1SSP will also be able to detect call delivery
1879 failure indications received by the LSRG via SIP signaling from the NG Emergency Services
1880 Network.
1881 10.4.1.1.3 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
1882 As for the all-IP end-state configuration and interworking architectures involving LNGs, an
1883 NG9-1-1SSP will be able to detect when IP connectivity to the PSAP, or IP connectivity
1884 between the first routing element in the NG Emergency Services Network and other downstream
1885 network elements, is unavailable, resulting in alternate routing of the emergency call or PSAP
1886 isolation. The NG9-1-1SSP will be responsible for monitoring IP connections for transport
1887 alarms associated with IP connections from ingress LSRGs and between elements within the NG
1888 Emergency Services Network. The NG9-1-1SSP will be responsible for capturing network
1889 traffic, generating alarms and producing other metrics for monitoring and troubleshooting
Page 60 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1890 outages within NG Emergency Services Networks, as well as those impacting the ability of an
1891 NG Emergency Services Network to deliver calls to the target PSAP.
1892 10.4.1.2 Location Delivery Failures
1893 10.4.1.2.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
1894 As for interworking architectures involving LNGs, legacy originating network providers will
1895 have the ability to determine whether or not a calling number/ANI and/or a pANI (e.g., ESRK,
1896 ESRD) is included in the outgoing MF or SS7 signaling sent to an SR (i.e., via Demarc Point 1)
1897 with an emergency call. If the originating network provider fails to include a calling
1898 number/ANI and/or a pANI in outgoing SS7 or MF signaling to the SR, it can conclude that
1899 location information will not be delivered to the PSAP.
1900 Legacy wireless originating network providers will be responsible for providing caller location
1901 when queried by a legacy ALI system (i.e., via Demarc Point 2) using the E2 protocol or MLP.
1902 If the legacy wireless originating network receives a request for updated caller location from a
1903 legacy ALI system, it can assume that the NG PSAP/LPG received a location-by-reference
1904 associated with the emergency call, and that the ingress LSRG received a dereference request
1905 from the NG PSAP/LPG (see below for further details). The legacy wireless originating network
1906 provider will be able to determine whether the location request from the legacy ALI system was
1907 processed successfully, but they will not know whether the location information was
1908 successfully returned to the NG PSAP/LPG.
1909 10.4.1.2.2 Failures Detected by E9-1-1 System Service Providers
1910 Since the E9-1-1SSP is assumed to also be responsible for operating the ingress LSRG, the E9-
1911 1-1SSP will have the ability to determine whether or not location information is included in the
1912 outgoing SIP signaling sent by the LSRG to an NG Emergency Services Network (i.e., via
1913 Demarc Point 14). If the E9-1-1SSP/LSRG operator fails to include location information (by-
1914 value or by-reference) in outgoing SIP signaling to an NG Emergency Services Network, it can
1915 conclude that location information was not delivered to the PSAP.
1916 When the E9-1-1SSP receives emergency calls from a legacy wireline originating network
1917 provider, the location information delivered to the NG Emergency Services Network (i.e., via
1918 Demarc Point 14) with the call will typically be in the form of location-by-value. An LSRG that
1919 delivers location-by-value to an NG Emergency Services Network will not be able to determine
1920 whether or not that location information is subsequently delivered to the PSAP by the NG
1921 Emergency Services Network.
1922 When the E9-1-1SSP receives an incoming emergency call from a legacy wireless originating
1923 network, the E9-1-1SSP will be able to determine whether location information (by-reference)
1924 was successfully provided by the LSRG to the NG Emergency Services Network with the call
1925 using SIP signaling (i.e., via Demarc Point 14). The E9-1-1SSP must also support location
1926 dereference requests to the ingress LSRG from routing elements in the NG Emergency Services
1927 Network (via Demarc Point 15) as well as NG PSAPs (via Demarc Point 17) and LPGs (via
1928 Demark Point 16). If an LSRG receives a dereference request from an NG PSAP, it can
1929 conclude that that the location-by-reference that it signaled to the NG Emergency Services
Page 61 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1930 Network was successfully delivered to the NG PSAP. The E9-1-1SSP will also be able detect
1931 any failures by the LSRG to provide location-by-value in response to location dereference
1932 requests from NG Emergency Services Network elements, NG PSAPs, or LPGs.
1933 10.4.1.2.3 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
1934 Routing elements in an NG Emergency Services Network will be able to detect failures in the
1935 delivery of location information to the NG Emergency Services Network. If an ingress LSRG
1936 fails to provide location information to the NG Emergency Services Network in the SIP
1937 signaling associated with an emergency call, the NG Emergency Services Network will perform
1938 default routing of the emergency call. The NG9-1-1SSP will be able to determine whether
1939 location information received from an ingress LSRG (“by-value” or “by-reference”) with the
1940 call is successfully delivered to the NG PSAP (i.e., via Demarc 11) or the LPG (i.e., via Demarc
1941 Point 6).
1942 When a routing element in an NG Emergency Services Network receives location-by-reference
1943 from an ingress LSRG, it will launch a dereference request back to the LSRG to obtain the
1944 routing location. The NG9-1-1SSP will be able to detect failures in the dereference process if a
1945 routing element in the NG Emergency Services Network does not receive a location-by-value in
1946 response to the location dereference request.
1947 The NG9-1-1SSP will not have visibility into location dereference requests initiated by NG9-1-1
1948 PSAPs or LPGs toward ingress LSRGs.
1949 10.4.1.3 Callback Information Delivery Failures
1950 10.4.1.3.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
1951 Legacy wireline originating network providers and legacy wireless originating network
1952 providers that use the NCAS method have the ability to determine whether outgoing MF or SS7
1953 signaling delivered to an SR (i.e., via Demarc 1) includes an MF ANI or SS7 Calling Party
1954 Number, but they will not be able to detect whether the callback information was successfully
1955 delivered to the PSAP.
1956 Legacy wireless originating network providers that use the WCM approach for emergency calls
1957 will be able to determine whether callback information is returned in response to an E2 or MLP
1958 request from a legacy ALI (i.e., via Demarc Point 2). However, the originating network provider
1959 will not have visibility into the availability of that information to any other network element or
1960 PSAP.
1961 10.4.1.3.2 Failures Detected by E9-1-1 System Service Providers
1962 The E9-1-1SSP (which is assumed to also be responsible for operating the ingress LSRG) will
1963 have the ability to determine whether or not callback information was received from the
1964 originating network (i.e., via Demarc Point 2), in call setup signaling, and whether it is included
1965 in the outgoing SIP signaling sent by the LSRG to an NG Emergency Services Network (i.e., via
1966 Demarc Point 14) to establish the emergency call. An LSRG that delivers callback information
1967 to an NG Emergency Services Network will not be able to determine whether or not that
Page 62 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
1968 callback information is subsequently delivered to the PSAP by the NG Emergency Services
1969 Network.
1970 An E9-1-1SSP will also be able to recognize when an LSRG queries an ALI system for
1971 location/callback information, and the ALI system in turn queries the legacy wireless originating
1972 network for location/callback information using the E2 protocol or MLP. The E9-1-1SSP will be
1973 able to determine whether callback information was successfully obtained by the ALI system
1974 from the legacy wireless originating network (i.e., via Demarc Point 2), and was successfully
1975 delivered to the LSRG. As described above, the E9-1-1SSP will be able to determine whether
1976 callback information was successfully delivered to an NG Emergency Services Network in
1977 outgoing SIP signaling, but will not be able to determine whether callback information was
1978 successfully delivered to the PSAP.
1979 10.4.1.3.3 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
1980 NG9-1-1SSPs will be able to determine whether callback information was received in incoming
1981 signaling from an ingress LSRG (i.e., via Demarc Point 14), and will also be able detect whether
1982 callback information was successfully delivered to an NG PSAP (i.e., via Demarc Point 11) or
1983 an LPG (i.e., via Demarc Point 6) in call setup signaling.
1984 As described in Section 10.3.3.2, an NG9-1-1SSP will not be able to detect whether callback
1985 information was successfully delivered to a legacy PSAP via an LPG, unless the NG9-1-1SSP
1986 also operates the LPG. If the NG9-1-1SSP is also responsible for operating the LPG, it will have
1987 visibility into whether callback information was successfully delivered to the legacy PSAP.
1988 Egress Legacy Selective Router Gateway
1989 10.4.2.1 Call Delivery Failures
1990 10.4.2.1.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
1991 The ability for an IP-based originating network to detect call delivery failures in an architecture
1992 where emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs via SRs that are connected to NG
1993 Emergency Services Networks via egress LSRGs is the same as described in Section 10.1.1.1 ,
1994 with the exception that the SIP-based call failure indications/messages will come from the egress
1995 LSRG rather than from an NG PSAP.
1996 The ability for a legacy originating network to detect call delivery failures in an architecture
1997 where emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs via SRs that are interconnected to egress
1998 LSRGs is the same as described in Section 10.2.1.1, except that if the originating network
1999 provider is also the LNG operator, the originating network provider will receive SIP-based call
2000 delivery failure indications (i.e., at the LNG) from the egress LSRG rather than from an NG
2001 PSAP.
2002 10.4.2.1.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
2003 An NG9-1-1SSP will be able to detect when IP connectivity to the egress LSRG (i.e., via
2004 Demarc Point 18) is unavailable. The NG9-1-1SSP will be responsible for monitoring these IP
2005 connections for transport alarms. The NG9-1-1SSP will not be able to detect when the MF
Page 63 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
2006 (emergency message) trunks to the PSAP are unavailable. SIP-based call delivery failure
2007 indications generated by the egress LSRG in response to SS7 Release messages with certain
2008 Cause Indicator parameter values will be passed to the NG Emergency Services Network. This
2009 will allow the NG9-1-1SSP to indirectly detect when there is a failure to deliver an emergency
2010 call to a legacy PSAP that is served by an SR.
2011 10.4.2.1.3 Failures Detected by E9-1-1 System Service Providers
2012 Since the E9-1-1SSP is also expected to be responsible for operating the egress LSRG, the E9-1-
2013 1SSP will be expected to monitor for transport alarms associated with IP connections from the
2014 NG Emergency Services Network.
2015 An E9-1-1SSP will also be able to detect when SS7 connectivity from the egress LSRG, or MF
2016 connectivity to the PSAP, is unavailable, resulting in SR or PSAP isolation. The E9-1-1SSP will
2017 be responsible for capturing network traffic, generating alarms and producing other metrics for
2018 monitoring and troubleshooting outages within the legacy Emergency Services Network
2019 elements and the egress LSRG.
2020 10.4.2.2 Location Delivery Failures
2021 10.4.2.2.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
2022 The ability for an IP-based originating network to detect location delivery failures in an
2023 architecture where emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs via SRs that are connected to
2024 NG Emergency Services Networks via egress LSRGs will be the same as described in Section
2025 10.1.2.1 , with the following clarification. The originating network provider must also support
2026 location dereference requests from egress LSRGs (via Demarc Point 20). If an IP-based
2027 originating network receives a dereference request from an egress LSRG, it can conclude that
2028 the location-by-reference that it signaled to the NG Emergency Services Network was
2029 successfully delivered to the LSRG, but it will not have visibility into whether or not location is
2030 successfully delivered to the legacy PSAP. In addition, the IP-based originating network will be
2031 able to detect any failures to provide location-by-value in response to location dereference
2032 requests from LSRGs.
2033 The ability for a legacy originating network to detect location delivery failures in an architecture
2034 where emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs by SRs that are connected to NG
2035 Emergency Services Networks via egress LSRGs will be the same as described in Section
2036 10.2.2.1, with the following clarification. An originating network provider that operates an LNG
2037 must support location dereference requests from egress LSRGs (via Demarc Point 19). If an
2038 LNG receives a dereference request from an LSRG, it can conclude that that the location-by-
2039 reference that it signaled to the NG Emergency Services Network was successfully delivered to
2040 the LSRG, but it will have no visibility into whether or not location information is successfully
2041 delivered to the legacy PSAP. The LNG will also be able to detect any failures to provide
2042 location-by-value in response to location dereference requests from LSRGs.
2043 10.4.2.2.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
2044 The ability for an NG9-1-1SSP to detect location delivery failures in an architecture where
2045 emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs by SRs that are connected to NG Emergency
Page 64 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
2046 Services Networks via egress LSRGs will be the same as described in Sections 10.1.2.2 and
2047 10.2.2.2, with the following clarifications. The NG9-1-1SSP will be able to determine whether
2048 location information received from the IP originating network or LNG (“by-value” or “by-
2049 reference”) with the call is successfully delivered to the egress LSRG (i.e., via Demarc Point
2050 18), but will not be able to determine whether location information was successfully delivered to
2051 the legacy PSAP.
2052 10.4.2.2.3 Failures Detected by E9-1-1 System Service Providers
2053 Since the E9-1-1SSP is assumed to also be responsible for operating the egress LSRG, the E9-1-
2054 1SSP will have the ability to determine whether or not location information was included in the
2055 incoming SIP signaling received by the egress LSRG from an NG Emergency Services Network
2056 (i.e., via Demarc Point 18). The E9-1-1SSP will also be able to determine whether a calling
2057 number and/or pANI (i.e., the location key generated by the egress LSRG) was received by the
2058 SR in incoming SS7 signaling from the egress LSRG, and the SR was able to successfully
2059 deliver that information to the target PSAP with the call. If the SR fails to receive a calling
2060 number/pANI in incoming signaling from the LSRG, it will include a substitute ANI string (e.g.,
2061 0-9-1-1-0000 or 000-9-1-1-0000) in the signaling to the PSAP. If an ANI failure condition is
2062 encountered by an SR, the E9-1-1SSP can also conclude that an ALI failure has occurred, since
2063 the calling number/pANI is the key to the location information for a call routed via an egress
2064 LSRG.
2065 Since the E9-1-1SSP is also the LSRG provider, an E9-1-1SSP that is also an ALI provider will
2066 be responsible for steering location queries received by the ALI system from the PSAP to the
2067 egress LSRG. The E9-1-1SSP will be able to detect whether or not those queries result in the
2068 successful return of location information by the LSRG. An E9-1-1SSP that is also an ALI
2069 provider will also be able detect whether that location information was successfully returned by
2070 the ALI system to the PSAP.
2071 Since the E9-1-1SSP also has responsibility for the LSRG, it will have visibility into whether a
2072 location dereference request initiated by an egress LSRG toward an originating network (i.e., via
2073 Demarc Point 20) or toward an LNG (i.e., via Demarc Point 19) resulted in the successful return
2074 of location information to the LSRG. The E9-1-1SSP will also be able to determine whether
2075 location information was successfully delivered to the legacy PSAP via the ALI system.
2076 10.4.2.3 Callback Information Delivery Failures
2077 10.4.2.3.1 Failures Detected by Originating Network Providers
2078 IP-based originating network providers will have the ability to determine whether outgoing
2079 signaling delivered to an NG Emergency Services Network (via Demarc Point 3) includes
2080 callback information, but they will not be able to detect whether the callback information was
2081 successfully delivered to an egress LSRG or PSAP.
2082 The ability for a legacy originating network to detect failures in the delivery of callback
2083 information in an architecture where emergency calls are delivered to legacy PSAPs by SRs that
2084 are connected to NG Emergency Services Networks via egress LSRGs will be the same as
2085 described in Section 10.2.3.1, with the following clarification. Legacy wireline originating
Page 65 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
2086 network providers and legacy wireless originating network providers that use the NCAS method
2087 will be able to determine whether outgoing MF or SS7 signaling delivered to an LNG (i.e., via
2088 Demarc 1) includes an MF ANI or SS7 Calling Party Number, but they will not be able to detect
2089 whether the callback information was successfully delivered to an egress LSRG or PSAP. If the
2090 legacy originating network provider also operates the LNG, it will be able to determine whether
2091 the SIP signaling delivered to the NG Emergency Services Network (via Demarc Point 3)
2092 includes callback information, but they will not be able to detect whether the callback
2093 information was successfully delivered to an egress LSRG or PSAP.
2094 10.4.2.3.2 Failures Detected by NG9-1-1 System Service Providers
2095 NG9-1-1SSPs will be able to determine whether callback information was received in incoming
2096 signaling from an IP originating network or LNG, and will also be able detect whether callback
2097 information was successfully delivered to an egress LSRG (i.e., via Demarc Point 18), but they
2098 will not be able to detect whether callback information was successfully delivered to the PSAP.
2099 10.4.2.3.3 Failures Detected by E9-1-1 System Service Providers
2100 Since the E9-1-1SSP is assumed to also be responsible for operating the egress LSRG, the E9-1-
2101 1SSP will have the ability to determine whether or not callback information was included in the
2102 incoming SIP signaling received by the egress LSRG from an NG Emergency Services Network
2103 (i.e., via Demarc Point 18). The E9-1-1SSP will also be able to determine whether an SS7
2104 Calling Party Number parameter populated with callback information was delivered to the SR
2105 by the egress LSRG, as well as whether the SR was able to successfully deliver that callback
2106 information to the target PSAP with the call. If the SR fails to receive an SS7 Calling Party
2107 Number containing callback information in incoming signaling from the LSRG, and the PSAP
2108 expects to receive callback information via the MF interface from the SR, the SR will include a
2109 substitute ANI string (e.g., 0-9-1-1-0000 or 000-9-1-1-0000) in the signaling to the PSAP. The
2110 E9-1-1SSP will be able to detect whether an ANI failure condition is encountered by an SR.
2111 If the E9-1-1SSP is also the ALI provider, it will be able to detect whether callback information
2112 is included in responses to ALI queries steered by the ALI system to the egress LSRG. An E9-1-
2113 1SSP that is also an ALI provider will also be able detect whether that callback information was
2114 successfully returned by the ALI system to the PSAP.
11 Analysis of Best Practices
2115
2116 The Best Practices review process consisted of a thorough evaluation of the over 1000 existing
2117 CSRIC Best Practices by suggesting Best Practices that could be extended to apply to NG9-1-1,
2118 identifying potential gaps for which additional Best Practices could be developed, and proposing
2119 Best Practices to fill those gaps.
2120 As noted on the FCC Best Practices website [12], traditional framework of CSRIC Best
2121 Practices establishes Network types as:
2122  Cable
2123  Internet/Data
2124  Satellite
Page 66 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
2125  Wireless
2126  Wireline
2127 Industry roles are also described within the CSRIC framework as:
2128  Service Provider
2129  Network Operator
2130  Equipment Supplier
2131  Government
2132  Public Safety
2133  Property Manager
2134
2135 The Working Group focused on identifying gaps in existing CSRIC Best Practices, and
2136 recommendations for new Best Practices which could assist in minimizing outages as the legacy
2137 9-1-1 systems are migrated to NG9-1-1. Existing CSRIC Best Practices were evaluated for
2138 applicability to NG9-1-1, and gaps were observed. Appendix B provides modified Best Practices
2139 and Appendix C provides new Best Practices that relate to the gaps identified with existing Best
2140 Practices. Specifically, the Best Practices provided in Appendixes B and C focus on areas that
2141 represent the scope and capabilities within the transition from legacy 9-1-1 to advanced Next
2142 Generation 9-1-1 IP infrastructures, and the interconnection to NG9-1-1.
2143 Note that the Best Practices identified in Appendix B –Recommended Changes to Existing 9-1-1
2144 Related Best Practices, and in Appendix C –Recommended NEW 9-1-1 Related Best Practices.
2145 are representative of (200+) modified and (40) proposed new Best Practices that apply to NG9-
2146 1-1.
2147 The Working Group recognized the importance of cyber security for 9-1-1 networks. There have
2148 been extensive efforts related to this category in prior FCC initiatives as they apply 9-1-1 and
2149 the Working Group yields to the recommendations developed by NIST [10], TFOPA [4], CSRIC
2150 III, IV and V (https://www.fcc.gov/about-fcc/advisory-committees/communications-security-
2151 reliability-and-interoperability-council) for these critical reports and applicable Best Practices.
12 Analysis of Network Monitoring/Reporting Tool Research
2152
2153 In June of 2017 the FCC tasked Working Group 1, Task Group 1 with responsibility to make
2154 recommendations on improving reliability of both legacy 9-1-1 and NG9-1-1 systems, including
2155 the transition to NG9-1-1. For the purpose of this discussion, “systems” refer to the call
2156 origination networks, the legacy 9-1-1 systems and the NG9-1-1 systems in terms of stakeholder
2157 roles to one or more or the above.
2158 While the charter included many deliverables related to mitigating risks against the threat of
2159 outages to both legacy 9-1-1 and NG9-1-1, the FCC sought recommended action to encourage
2160 the private sector to detect or deter threats to 9-1-1 before they reach the ESInet perimeter. In
2161 line with the FCC charter the focus of this section is to disclose the finding of the Working
2162 Group research and identify tools that are already available, or not overly burdensome to
2163 implement for carriers and 9-1-1 System Service Providers.
Page 67 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
2164 Unfortunately, the term “burdensome” is subject to differing interpretations based on the user
2165 circumstances. For this Report the Working Group considered the following to represent
2166 examples of burdensome circumstances:
2167  The recommended / required change will result in significant 9 negative impact to the
2168 current year and following 3 years operations and capital budget.
2169  The recommended / required change will result in a significant negative impact to the
2170 operations staff due to the new skill sets and certifications required to operate the new
2171 equipment / systems.
2172  The recommended / required change may result in a significant negative impact to
2173 service uptime due to the lack of adequate system redundancy. The change is designed
2174 such that it cannot be implemented during the normal contracted maintenance window
2175 thus requiring extended system unavailability.
2176 In an effort to identify network tools currently used by the private sector to detect and deter
2177 outages, the Working Group conducted research with the private sector industry representatives
2178 serving on the Working Group. The goal of the research was to assist with making
2179 recommendations regarding “system tools” private sector companies could consider using
2180 within their network operations to minimize outages during the transition from Legacy 9-1-1 to
2181 NG9-1-1. The research consisted of a series of open-ended questions designed to collect data on
2182 existing commercial, or customized, network tools. The research questions are described below:
2183  What tools do you use to detect, deter and report transport related issues? Are the tools
2184 commercially available, or developed internally for your organization?
2185  What tools do you use to detect and report any routing related issues (E9-1-1 and NG9-1-
2186 1 environments)? Are the tools commercially available, or developed internally for your
2187 company?
2188  What tools do you use to detect and report any proxy or other NG9-1-1 related issues?
2189 This would apply if you are running any of your own NG9-1-1 functional elements such
2190 as a Location Information Server (LIS), Legacy Network Gateway (LNG) or Legacy
2191 Selective Router Gateway (LSRG). Are the tools commercially available, or developed
2192 internally for your company?
2193  What tools do you use to detect and report any cyber or information security threat
2194 related issues? Are the tools commercially available, or developed internally for the
2195 company?
2196  Which information security management framework(s) (if any) do is applied to NG9-1-1
2197 products and services?
2198  What other recommendations, tools, key performance indicators or capabilities do you
2199 have that will assist in ensuring network reliability and help increase the situational
2200 awareness capabilities of the NG9-1-1 Service Providers, 9-1-1 Administrators, and/or
2201 PSAPs?
9 Significant is used herein consistent with previous FCC use of the term “commercially
reasonable”.

13 Recommendations
2202
2203 The CSRIC VI Working Group 1, Task Group 1 was directed to recommend measures to
2204 improve both legacy 9-1-1 and NG9-1-1, to include recommending ways in which the FCC may
2205 further the NG9-1-1 transition and enhance the reliability and effectiveness of NG9-1-1 through
2206 routing redundancy, maintenance, and to mitigate the threat of outages in both legacy 9-1-1 and
2207 NG9-1-1 systems. The FCC also charged the Work Group with recommending actions the FCC
2208 could take to encourage the private sector to detect or deter threats to 9-1-1 before they reach the
2209 ESInet perimeter. The Task Group 1 Report contains a thorough discussion and overview of
2210 transitional and end-state NG9-1-1 architectures which will aid Service Providers in
2211 understanding the complexities of NG9-1-1, and identifying potential points of failure with
2212 respect to emergency call delivery, location delivery and callback information delivery to
2213 PSAPs. The following recommendations should be considered by Service Providers in order to
2214 aid in a smooth transition to NG9-1-1.
2215 13.1 Understanding NG9-1-1 Architectures
2216 There is a need for Service Providers across all industry segments (cable, wireline, wireless,
2217 Interconnected VoIP) to be able to identify within their networks service-impacting events that
2218 impair or cause a total loss of service. Network events/ anomalies potentially impact 9-1-1 call
2219 delivery throughout the country and the Working Group recommends that Service Providers
2220 ensure Product Management and Network Operations personnel have a thorough understanding
2221 of the functional elements that support the transitional and end-state NG9-1-1 architectures
2222 described in this Report in the following sections:
2223  Section 4 describes various entities that have responsibility for managing risks and
2224 reporting outages in terms of stakeholder roles that are associated with different
2225 components of transitional and end-state NG9-1-1 architectures. These descriptions
2226 provide a basis for identifying the types of failures that may be visible to entities
2227 operating different components of the NG9-1-1 service architecture.
2228  Sections 5 through 9 describe the various components of transitional and end-state NG9-
2229 1-1 architectures and define points of demarcation that denote the logical boundaries of
2230 responsibility between the stakeholders responsible for providing those components.
2231 These sections provide detailed overviews of the various transitional and end-state NG9-1-1
2232 architectures to establish a framework for the analysis of potential failure points that follows.
2233 13.2 Identifying Risks with The Transition to NG9-1-1
2234 The Working Group studied specific types of failures that originating Service Providers, 9-1-1
2235 System Service Providers and other entities in the 9-1-1 call chain can detect, with the objective
2236 of deterring outages before they impact 9-1-1 call and data delivery to PSAPs.
2237 Section 10, Architectural Analysis analyzes the transitional and end-state NG9-1-1 architectures,
2238 by demarcation pint and stakeholder role, to identify potential points of failure from the
2239 perspective of:
2240  Call delivery failures,
Page 69 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
2241  Location delivery failures, and
2242  Callback information delivery failures.
2243 Potential failures in the delivery of other critical information to key architecture elements and
2244 PSAPs are also identified through the definition of the demarcation points and the high-level
2245 descriptions that comprise the architectural analysis.
2246 This section emphasizes how transitional and end-state NG9-1-1 architectures, by their very
2247 nature, limit any given stakeholder’s monitoring and reporting capabilities to those aspects of
2248 the architecture to which they have visibility.
2249 It is recommended that Service Providers should ensure their Product Management and Network
2250 Operations personnel have a thorough understanding of the Architectural Analysis as described
2251 in this Report and have a working knowledge of where potential network failures can be
2252 experienced.
2253 13.3 Recommended Actions to Detect and Deter Threats To 9-1-1.
2254 In a recent FCC publication, Summary of 9-1-1 Certification Data for 2017, the Public Safety
2255 and Homeland Security Bureau reported on 188 covered entities filing certifications consistent
2256 with the FCC 9-1-1 certification rules. Service Providers are encouraged to review the findings
2257 of the Report which contains aggregate network data from communications Service Providers
2258 that offer 9-1-1, E9-1-1 or NG9-1-1 capabilities. The Report also provides insight into measures
2259 that are being taken by the industry to enhance the reliability of 9-1-1 networks and those
2260 recommendations are incorporated into this document. Additionally, the FCC can assist in the
2261 smooth transition from Legacy 9-1-1 to NG9-1-1 by encouraging Service Providers to review in
2262 detail the findings in the Summary of 9-1-1 Certification Data for 2017 as well as this CSRIC VI
2263 Report. Specific attention should be paid to the network risk findings in Section 10,
2264 Architectural Analysis.
2265 For Service Providers and other 9-1-1 stakeholders who do not have robust network monitoring
2266 systems, the Working Group also recommends reviewing Section 12, Analysis of Network
2267 Monitoring/Report Tools. Based on research conducted by the Working Group, this section of
2268 the Report provides 9-1-1 stakeholders with a better understanding of the various network
2269 elements that require monitoring and commercially available tools that can be obtained to
2270 manage the various and complex elements of communications networks. The FCC clarified in
2271 its directive to determine if tools were commercially available and not burdensome to
2272 implement. The Working Group refrained from determining if the implementation of
2273 commercially available tools could be burdensome on a Service Provider. However, the
2274 Working Group strongly recommends that Service Providers consider incorporating network
2275 detection tools, as appropriate, to assist network operations in detecting or deterring threats to 9-
2276 1-1 before they reach the ESInet perimeter. The Working Group also recommends that Service
2277 Providers and other stakeholders work together to ensure that the system monitoring information
2278 that is needed to mitigate risks, monitor elements of the NG9-1-1 infrastructure and identify 9-1-
2279 1 outages is shared between providers and that the information is available to stakeholders when
2280 needed.

2281 13.4 Best Practices
2282 Working Group 1, Task Group 1 was asked to review existing Best Practices and develop
2283 additional guidance regarding overall monitoring, reliability, notifications, and accountability in
2284 preventing 9-1-1 outages in transitional NG9-1-1 environments. Existing CSRIC Best Practices
2285 were evaluated for applicability to NG9-1-1, gaps were observed, and additional Best Practices
2286 were proposed. Specifically, the Working Group performed the following tasks:
2287  Reviewed existing CSRIC Best Practices regarding overall monitoring, reliability,
2288 notifications, and accountability in preventing 9-1-1 outages in transitional NG9-1-1
2289 environments.
2290  Identified gaps in existing CSRIC Best Practices that should be filled to facilitate the
2291 transition to NG9-1-1.
2292  Developed additional guidance regarding overall monitoring, reliability, notifications,
2293 and accountability in preventing 9-1-1 outages in transitional NG9-1-1 environments.
2294  Made recommendations to protect the NG9-1-1 network, including recommendations for
2295 Best Practices and standards development.
2296 13.5 Cybersecurity Considerations
2297 While cybersecurity considerations are an important part of the transition to NG9-1-1, this
2298 Report does not focus on cybersecurity. The Working Group recommends that stakeholders take
2299 deliberate steps to consider the cybersecurity implications introduced by the transition to
2300 NG9-1-1. The Working Group also recommends that a future CSRIC focus on NG9-1-1 related
2301 cybersecurity challenges and develop Best Practices as appropriate.
2302 The public safety community must continually identify risks and address evolving physical and
2303 cyber security requirements. The rapid rate of technology advancement continues to outpace the
2304 public safety community’s ability stay ahead of the threats.
2305
2306 The SAFECOM Nationwide Survey (SNS), a public safety data collection effort conducted from
2307 January through March 2018, included input from federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, urban
2308 and rural communities, as well as across the span of public safety disciplines. Over a third (37
2309 percent) of SNS respondents indicated that cybersecurity incidents had an impact on the ability
2310 of their emergency response providers and government officials’ ability to communicate over
2311 the past five years. Yet, almost half (46 percent) of the organizations had not instituted
2312 cybersecurity best practices, such as risk assessment, continuous monitoring, and identity
2313 management. In fact, only one in five (20 percent) of the organizations indicated having
2314 cybersecurity incident response plans, policies, and capabilities.
2315 Like other aspects of communications, cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. All levels of
2316 government, private and nonprofit sectors, and individual citizens must work together to protect
2317 voice and data communications. Ideally, each organization would employ an enterprise-wide,
2318 risk-informed cybersecurity management program with continuous improvement and
2319 coordination with all interconnected systems and the broader community.
2320 The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework [10] is
2321 a flexible, risk-based approach to improving the security of critical infrastructure.
Page 71 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
2322 Collaboratively developed between government and the private sector, the Framework is
2323 designed to complement an existing risk management process or to develop a credible program
2324 if one does not exist. Governance is explicitly addressed within the Framework, and resources
2325 are provided to establish and communicate the necessary governance structures (e.g., risk
2326 councils) and organizational cybersecurity policy for risk management.
2327 Appendix-B Table B-3 of the SAFECOM document titled “FY 2019 SAFECOM Guidance on
2328 Emergency Communications Grants”, provides a list of Cybersecurity Resources. The document
2329 was created by the SAFECOM Funding and Sustainment Committee. The committee is made

2340 13.6 Research Findings
2341 The scope of the research was a small sampling of Working Group 1, Task Group 1 Private
2342 Sector Industry stakeholders. The information received was determined to be relevant in
2343 answering the FCC’s question, “Are there tools commercially available that can detect or deter
2344 to mitigate an outage?”.
Page 73 of 134The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VI
Final Report [March 8, 2019]
2345 The matrix in Appendix A – Aggregated Research Inquiry Results summarizes the response to
2346 the research and provides information on tools used to detect, deter and mitigate network
2347 anomalies within the 9-1-1 networks infrastructure. There are commercially available tools the
2348 private sector can deploy to assist in detecting, deterring or mitigating outages within the 9-1-1
2349 systems. Recognizing companies need to have tools in place to manage their networks, the tools
2350 companies elect to have in place to assist in managing the networks are company specific and
2351 depend on budgetary parameters, as well as available resources.
2352 In a recent publication, Summary of 9-1-1 Certification Data for 2017, the Public Safety and
2353 Homeland Security Bureau reported on 188 covered entities filing certifications consistent with
2354 the 9-1-1 certification rules. The Report contains aggregate network data from communications
2355 Service Providers that offer 9-1-1, E9-1-1 or NG9-1-1 capabilities such as call routing,
2356 automatic location information, and automatic number identifies directly to a public safety
2357 answering point. The following are the highlights of the FCC findings, and the Working Group
2358 encourages companies to review the Report in its entirety [13]:
2359 • “Of the 188 covered entities that filed certifications, 48 certified that they have diverse
2360 9-1-1 circuits to all PSAPs to which they provide 9-1-1 circuits. Twenty covered entities certified
2361 that they have implemented alternative measures in lieu of circuit diversity for all of the PSAPs
2362 that they serve. Fifteen covered entities certified that they provide diverse 9-1-1 circuits to some
2363 PSAPs and that they have implemented alternative measures to other PSAPs to which they
2364 provide 9-1-1 circuits.
2365 • “There were 6,769 unique PSAPs listed in the certifications for 9-1-1 circuit diversity.
2366 The certifications showed that of these 6,769 PSAPs, 3,855 PSAPs had diverse circuits and
2367 2,914 had implemented alternative measures.
2368 • “Of the 188 covered entities that filed certifications, 165 indicated that they have
2369 certified backup power in all central offices that serve PSAPs. Nine certified that they have
2370 alternative measures for backup power in all such central offices, and four covered entities
2371 certified that they have back-up power in some central offices and have implemented alternative
2372 measures in all other central offices.
2373 • “Of 188 covered entities that filed certifications, 51 stated that they have diverse
2374 monitoring in all of their 9-1-1 service areas, and ten stated that they have certified alternative
2375 measures in all 9-1-1 service areas. Seven covered entities certified that they provide diverse
2376 monitoring in some of their 9-1-1 service areas and have implemented alternative measures in
2377 all other 9-1-1 service areas.”
2378 As the United States migrates to a nationwide Next Generation 9-1-1 infrastructure, private
2379 sector companies operating within the 9-1-1 ecosystem should have a thorough understanding of
2380 Commission rules, recommended Best Practices and industry network tools that are designed to
2381 ensure the reliability of the 9-1-1 infrastructure, and mitigate risks.

14 Conclusions
2384
2385 CSRIC VI, Working Group 1, Task Group 1 is pleased to submit this Report which meets the
2386 Objectives set forth by the FCC as follows:
2387  Reviewed existing Best Practices regarding overall monitoring, reliability, notifications,
2388 and accountability in preventing 9-1-1 outages in transitional NG9-1-1 environments.
2389  Developed and recommended the modification and addition of Best Practices regarding
2390 overall monitoring, reliability, notifications, and accountability in preventing 9-1-1
2391 outages in transitional NG9-1-1 environments.
2392  Identified risks associated with transitional 9-1-1 systems that could result in disruptions
2393 to 9-1-1 service.
2394  Studied specific actions that originating Service Providers, 9-1-1 System Service
2395 Providers and other entities in the 9-1-1 call chain should take to detect and deter outage
2396 precursors before 9-1-1 calls are delivered to the ESInet gateway.
2397  Recommended actions the FCC could take to encourage the private sector stakeholders
2398 to detect or deter threats to 9-1-1 with a focus on identifying tools that are available for
2399 the various network components, and that may be commercially available.
2400 The Working Group is comprised of some of this country’s foremost 9-1-1 industry Subject
2401 Matter Experts. Through the dedication of this team the Report provides extensive educational
2402 insight into the various elements of transitional and end-state Next Generation 9-1-1
2403 architectures, with attention to details on potential outage risks. As our Nation transitions from a
2404 legacy 9-1-1 circuit-switched service architecture to an NG9-1-1 IP-based service architecture,
2405 this Report will aid all 9-1-1 stakeholders in understanding the core elements of the transition. It
2406 is recommended that Service Providers ensure their Network Operations and Product
2407 Management personnel are aware of the complexities associated with transitioning to NG9-1-1.
2408 It is important to understand the importance of the collaboration needed between all stakeholders
2409 in order to help facilitate a smooth transition to NG9-1-1. Stakeholders should also consider this
2410 Report as an opportunity to assess their own networks, and review all the functional elements
2411 involved in the transition and ensure the reliability and resiliency of those networks.

11‐8‐ Authentication System Failure: In the event of an authentication system failure, Service Providers, FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE
8108 Public Safety and Network Operators should determine how the system requiring support of the
authentication system responds (i.e., determine what specific effect(s) the failure caused). The
system can either be set to open or closed in the event of a failure. This will depend on the needs
of the organization. For instance, an authentication system supporting physical access may be
required to fail OPEN in the event of a failure, so people will not be trapped in the event of an
emergency. However, an authentication system that supports electronic access to core routers
may be required to fail CLOSED to prevent general access to the routers in the event of
authentication system failure.
In addition, it is important to have a means of alternate authenticated access to a system in the
event of a failure. In the case of core routers failing CLOSED, there should be a secondary means
of authentication (e.g., use of a one‐time password) reserved for use only in such an event; this
