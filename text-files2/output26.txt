Significantly Viewed List
Last Modified: May 27, 2021
This list of significantly viewed stations is being posted on the Commission’s Internet website at
http://www.fcc.gov/mb/ in accordance with 47 U.S.C. § 340(c)(2). This list was adopted on
November 2, 2005 as Appendix C to the Report and Order, Implementation of the Satellite Home
Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004, FCC 05-187 (rel. Nov. 3, 2005). The
Commission will update this list within 10 business days after taking an action to modify the list.
The stations listed below are “significantly viewed” in the relevant counties and/or communities as
indicated. The stations are listed by state and subdivided by the county in which they are
significantly viewed. Stations added on a community-by-community basis after 1972 are listed at
the end of each state next to the community in which they obtained significantly viewed status.
The station listing includes the current (and former) call signs, as well as the analog channel
number and city of license. Stations with a plus sign (+) under individual counties are those
stations added to the list after the publication of the Commission’s original 1972 list. See
Reconsideration of the Cable Television Report and Order, 36 FCC 2d 326 (1972). Stations listed
with a pound sign (#) have been the subject of application of the Commission’s exclusivity rules
and are subject to programming deletions in the indicated communities.
On March 31, 2020, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) seeking
comment on modernizing the methodology for determining whether a television broadcast station
is significantly viewed in a community outside of its television market. Unless and until the
Commission acts on the NPRM, the existing regulations governing how a station is determined to
be significantly viewed remain in effect. Link to the NPRM:
