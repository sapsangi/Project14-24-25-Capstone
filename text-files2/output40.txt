Final Report
1 Executive Summary
The Signaling System 7 (SS7) and Diameter are recognized as critical components of the United
States telecommunications infrastructure supporting both wireline and mobile services and
subscribers. These technologies have become targets of both domestic and international
attackers with different motivations and creating different risks for both service companies and
subscribers. The attacks have exploited the legacy trust ecosystem that has been in place for
many years. The increased interconnection among different types of service companies, and
changing business and geo-political factors have also played a role in increasing the frequency
and volume of targeted attacks. The result is that with more coverage, more networks, and more
participants, the probability that bad actors will exploit this community of trust has increased.
A new Working Group (WG) was created in June, 2016 to study this problem and develop
recommendations for the FCC and industry to mitigate the risks. This CSRIC Working Group
has assessed different attack vectors that have been documented and discussed in different
settings including blogs, conferences, and standards, as well as industry and government forums.
The Risk Assessment considered reported vulnerabilities (e.g., that have been discovered by
industry or security researchers) and reports of exploitation. Industry is taking steps to
coordinate and research the reported vulnerabilities and exploits, while being cognizant that the
overwhelming amount of SS7 traffic is legitimate. As a result, carriers need to be measured as
they implement steps and solutions in order to avoid collateral network impacts.
The WG membership consists of a wide range of participants including service companies,
suppliers, technology experts, and the US Government. While the WG was only convened
halfway through the CSRIC V establishment period, there has been extensive activity and
ongoing analysis by the WG of available SS7 attack methodology information, briefings from
Subject Matter Experts and the review of current and emerging industry best practices to address
the evolving threats.
A Risk Assessment report1 was completed prior to this Final report that captures background on
the SS7 technology and Diameter protocols, potential targets, prominent attack methodologies
and their potential impacts, as well as some key best practices and countermeasures to address
the threats.
In this final report the WG provides specific recommendations for industry as well as
recommended areas of further study for future FCC CSRIC efforts (See Section 5).

Final Report
2 Introduction
In the Technology Transitions Order of August 20152, the Commission notes that
“communications networks are rapidly transitioning away from the historic provision of time-
division multiplexed (TDM) services running on copper to new, all-Internet Protocol (IP)
multimedia networks.” The intermingling of legacy communications technologies with
advanced communications technologies introduces new threat vectors and cyber risk. Recently,
this issue has gained greater attention in light of the security threats to Signaling System 7 (SS7)
and its IP-based version SIGTRAN, a signaling protocol supporting call setup, routing,
exchange, and billing functions in communications networks by sending messages between
fixed and mobile communications service providers. The scale of SS7, which is the de facto
standard for carriers all over the world, means that every network subscriber could be vulnerable
to these security risks, elevating concerns among stakeholders in the communications sector.
As part of a series of requests to the Communication Security, Reliability, Interoperability
Council (CSRIC), the Commission asked the CSRIC V to examine vulnerabilities associated
with the SS7 protocol and other key related communications protocols (e.g., Diameter). CSRIC
V Working Group 10 was tasked to assess existing and potential threats and current defensive
mechanisms and make recommendations to the FCC and industry on how to best address
security challenges present in SS7 and other communications protocols used between
communications networks, as well as their exposure and impact on the transition to next
generation networks.

3 Overview of SS7 – Summary Assessment, Background
Signaling System 7 (SS7) is the global standard signaling protocol dating back over three
decades and is used for telecommunications traffic for most of the world’s public switched
telephone network (PSTN) calls, including wireline, legacy 2G and 3G cellular networks. After
Page 5 of 19The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council V Working Group 10
March 2017
Final Report
years of rapid growth in mobile communications, the scale of SS7 approaches Internet
proportions. Today, networks based on SS7 protocols manage the circuit-switched links among
hundreds of carriers for wireline and wireless services and operators serving the majority of the
7.46 billion mobile subscribers worldwide as of June 2016.3
The SS7 Network was originally founded on the basis of trust between members of a small
closed community of carriers. Carriers interconnected their SS7 networks because they properly
presumed that the information and messages they receive from other carriers are valid and for
legitimate purposes, and the system has proven effective and reliable over a significant amount
of time. However, the SS7 Community has evolved over time as the industry and ecosystem
expanded, yielding several consequences:
 The growth in mobility use and widespread global roaming has increased the number of
carriers with access to the SS7 network.
 The assumptive trust nature of the network being a closed community was true when
SS7 was first deployed. After the global trend in deregulation of the telecommunications
sector, in the U.S. exemplified by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, deregulation
removed many of the restrictions on access and, in fact, mandated the opening up of
networks. While this is a good thing for an array of reasons, it did result in certain
complications, one of which is the barrier to gain access to SS7 was dramatically
lowered.
 Access to SS7 networks has increased over the past few decades, in some instances, by
design, as telecommunications networks and network functions were opened up to more
competition, and were adapted to novel uses and new services, like Application to user
Short Message Service (SMS) services (e.g. for financial information, flight information,
password recovery etc.).
Ultimately, the result is that with more coverage, more networks, and more participants, the
attack surface for a bad actor to potentially exploit this community of trust has increased.
As discussed in the Risk Assessment Report, SS7 is applied to both wireline and wireless
networks. The SS7 protocol consists of several layers. The lower layer, Message Transfer Part
(MTP) is used for transporting SS7 messages over Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) circuits,
while SIGTRAN (Signaling Transport) is used for transporting SS7 messages over IP. The
ISDN User Part (ISUP) is used for setting up and tearing down telephone calls between
switches. For database queries, the Services Connection Control Part (SCCP) and Transaction
Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) are used. These are the basic protocols used in today’s
SS7 networks. Figure 1 illustrates the SS7 protocol stack when operating over TDM.

Final Report
Figure 1: SS7 Protocol Stack over TDM
When cellular networks were first developed, the ability for switches to access databases became
a critical function for authenticating subscribers and determining the permissions a subscriber
would have in the network. A new protocol was developed for supporting wireless services,
called the Mobile Application Part (MAP).
3.1 Application to Wireline Networks
Wireline (fixed) networks depend on SS7 primarily for the connection of voice calls. However,
numbering services such as 800, 411, 911, and Number Portability rely heavily on the SS7
network for routing such calls to their proper destinations. There are many other services
provided by wireline service providers that are not possible without the SS7 network. Calling
Name Display, E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM), and other Intelligent Network (IN) based
services are also commonplace.
3.1.1 Generic Architectural View
A wireline telephony network is significantly simpler than wireless counterparts, especially
where VoIP is not supported. Figure 2 illustrates a simple wireline SS7 network. The Service
Switching Point (SSP) is the voice switch. Note that the Signal Transfer Point (STP) can be
deployed as a Local STP (LSTP) or Regional STP (RSTP) depending on the network topology.
The various databases used in the network to support services are referred to as Service Control
Points (SCPs) and provide further instructions to the switches as to how to handle calls. This
includes routing of calls to a different destination than what was originally intended (e.g., call
forwarding). This network architecture is referred to as the Intelligent Network (IN) in
international standards, and the Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) in North America.

3.1.2 Relevant Standards & Protocols
Wireline networks do not use the Mobile Application Part (MAP) of SS7 as this protocol was
developed solely for the support of various wireless services. However, they do use SS7 and the
IN protocol for transactional sessions.
3.1.3 Security Practices
Over the years, the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) standards forum
has developed security requirements for protecting the control and management planes for the
public telecommunications network. As with wireless networks, interconnect policies should be
established for every network interconnect. While researchers have not yet demonstrated
exploits in wireline networks, or provided empirical evidence thereof, it should be assumed that
these networks are vulnerable like their wireless counterparts. For those networks that have not
implemented protections, access to the control plane of a participant SS7 network may result in
an array of attack vectors as discussed in the Risk Assessment.
3.1.4 Transition to New Technology
Wireline networks are also moving to IP-based architecture, using the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) protocol to replace ISUP for the connection of calls. Diameter would then be used for all
‘transaction related’ traffic in the network by providing charging records and replacing the IN
component (Diameter was originally developed to replace the older Remote Authentication
Dial-In Service (RADIUS) protocol in charging networks). Many operators have already made
this transition to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) architectures, which brings an additional
set of attack vectors and vulnerabilities into considerations, albeit outside the scope of this

report. Figure 4 illustrates the evolution of signaling protocols.

3.2 Application to Mobile Network
3.2.1 Generic Architectural Overview
SS7 and the GSM MAP protocols are used as an interexchange (IPX) mechanism to coordinate
global roaming between mobile network operators. On the order of about 800 operators are
officially recognized and a large number of service providers have wholesale business
arrangements and lease out access. Large service providers often maintain direct connections
with “peers” while small operators use wholesale connectivity services. Also new players that
come from the classical Internet business and now offer connectivity service often just rent the
connectivity service from a connectivity provider and do not make all roaming contracts
themselves e.g. Apple SIM. An IPX provider may aggregate access with other operators that
could traverse several IPX providers from source to destination.
3.2.2 Relevant Standards & Protocols
The primary protocol used by the research community to demonstrate potential vulnerabilities
discussed in this report are part of the SS7 protocol suite. Specifically, the MAP component has
been used to effectuate these exploits: however, these vulnerabilities are not limited to the SS7
protocol suite. As previously discussed, the fact that access to networks is possible through any
number of complicit or compromised operators means that all telecommunications protocols

used to interconnect networks are potentially at risk. This includes SIP interconnects, as well as
Diameter. The Intelligent Network (IN) and Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) protocols,
which are also part of the SS7 suite, should be considered for future assessment.
3.2.3 Security Practices
Key Standardization Forum for Network Security
The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) defines global telecommunications standards while more national organizations (e.g.,
ATIS and American National Standards Institute [ANSI]) provide implementations of these
standards for national networks. The 3GPP covers cellular telecommunications network
technologies including radio access, core network and service capabilities. 3GPP has been
studying the security of next generation systems to support existing and new multi-media
services. The new network architectures need to be more flexible, scalable, secure and extensible
to support different traffic characteristics and a variety of users and service requirements. The
work is focusing on securing the user, management and control planes to protect the interfaces,
network elements and data flows.
Key Industry Forum for Signaling Interconnection Security
The GSMA organization is a global mobile industry trade association. Among its many industry
functions the GSMA coordinates roaming across the globe. It facilitates the needed information
exchange to allow operators to connect to each other. It offers for example, legal documents
related to roaming, protocol usage information, certification, technical operator network
descriptions repository and many other enablers for roaming. The GSMA has about 800 operator
members. The GSMA has many focused subgroups, in particular it has a Packet Group that
deals with protocol implementation and a Fraud and Security Group4, which has a subgroup
focused on interconnection security.
Since the global mobile network in the past was a closed network, there was little need for
security experts to secure the network interconnection. This resulted in the fact that today there
are only a handful of interconnection security experts in the world that focus on protection of
networks on the interconnect interface between operators. Interconnection security requires a
combination of expert security and telecommunication protocol knowledge. The largest group in
the world with an intersection of such experts is found in the GSMA security groups.
GSMA has produced several standard guideline documents designed to help mobile operators
detect and protect their networks from malicious SS7 activity. Several of the key documents are
identified and referenced in the Risk Assessment Report. It is worth noting that these
documents are only available to GSMA members at this time.5

Final Report
4 Summary Conclusions from Risk Assessment Report
The Working Group conducted a risk assessment of the risks to carriers, individual subscribers
and critical infrastructure services from exploiting the SS7 signaling infrastructures, and
possible implications to the Diameter protocol. There is reported evidence of attacks being
launched against U.S. carriers by exploiting the available signaling functionality and trusted
interconnection that the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure is built on. The Risk Assessment
report is a view of the current risk.
Based on feedback and review with industry subject matter experts the need was identified to
establish a picture of what is going on in the U.S. that would correspond to monitoring networks
for ”unauthorized commands”, based on GSMA FS.11 and corresponding network statistics.
The major telecommunications carriers and suppliers have recognized the current risks and have
been implementing various countermeasures to analyze and block specific attacks or suspicious
traffic. As noted in this report and the risk assessment, because the overwhelming amount of
SS7 traffic is legitimate, carriers need to be measured as they implement solutions in order to
avoid collateral network impacts. We have identified recommendations in the next section from
Working Group members and SMEs that are actively working with U.S. and international
telecom infrastructures and in standards forums. The following are preliminary views from the
Risk Assessment report.
4.1 Interconnection Monitoring and Filtering
The experts recommended that industry carefully evaluate ”peer” relationships based on the
GSMA guidelines and recommended service level terms. Message filtering based on GSMA
recommendations are viewed as having the most significant mitigating impact.
GSMA SS7 firewall rules, FS.11, IR.82 (as far as applicable), are the most relevant documents.
The experts identified the most likely filtering point as the STPs or in proximity to the STP. The
Home Location Register (HLR) is also a ”rich” target and needs similar protections. The
MSC/xGSN/VLR are identifed as likely ”at-risk nodes”. In addition, network elements need to
be audited to ensure subscriber profiles have not been modified.
The experts further observed that depending on the existing node capabilities, filtering may be
doable with ”configuration & tuning” within the network itself. It was further recommended by
the experts that the vast majority of the current SS7 threats that address three (3) attack scenarios
(Track, Intercept, Fraud), rely on ten (10) SS7 messages that can be rejected using four (4)
defense measures: STP, HLR, SS7 firewall functionality (if needed), and monitoring and
filtering. Nevertheless, it should be noted, when attackers no longer have access to the desired
information they will likely attempt to adapt and may thereby target other SS7 message
scenarios.
The scenarios and messages are outlined below in Figure 5. The depicted functional and
architectural configurations are examples of possible control points within the service provider

network.

4.2 IPSec
The use of IPSec for the GSM MAP protocol has been considered. Upgrading of SS7 / MAP
with IPSec would require a very significant systemic peer-wise effort and most operators are
not bound to the FCC or US based practices. Therefore it is considered at this time that IPSec
for MAP at interconnection points would have very low impact and very limited benefits,
noncommensurate with the complexity implications and requisite investment.
4.3 Diameter & 5G Networks
As described in the Risk Assessment, the evolution towards Diameter being used in the
underlying infrastructure creates potential risks that need to be factored into the security
approach. Diameter has certain inherent capabilities that make it more difficult to attack. While
the Diameter protocol supports the same functions as SS7 (and many more), Diameter could
introduce new vulnerabilities that need to be considered. The two protocols work very
differently as do their network substrates and systemic effects, and this should be taken into
consideration when assessing Diameter. That said, the research community has given
Page 12 of 19The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council V Working Group 10
March 2017
Final Report
demonstrations using the Diameter protocol to execute similar exploits seen on the SS7 network.
In addition, researchers have also identified other potential, theoretical exploits on Diameter.
Given that service operators currently do not use Diameter for interconnection, there is no
empirical evidence that Diameter is being exploited. However, as in SS7, attackers will likely
attempt to exploit any potential access susceptibility. The Diameter Edge Agent (DEA) is
responsible for protecting the network from unauthorized access and should have the ability to
filter all Diameter commands, their Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs), and the origin and destination
of the command (host/realm). In addition, the DEA should be capable of examining the
application-ID portion of the message to make sure that the Diameter command being sent is
allowed to be sent over the received interface (i.e., S6a), in accordance with 3GPP standards.
Other potential risk areas beside upcoming Diameter are ANSI MAP (3GPP2 version of MAP),
SCCP based Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, MAPv1 or Global Title Point code (GTP) data
attacks.
The GSMA FASG has developed the Diameter Security Guidelines (FS.19) to address the
Diameter vulnerabilities, and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
Cybersecurity WG is addressing Diameter as well as 5G security. Diameter is a critical
component of 5G networks, and therefore close attention needs to be paid to the Diameter
protocol. 5G networks will use diameter as one of their main protocols for communication. For
coverage reasons, the device may contain a foreign SIM of the partner-operator to ensure the
coverage (i.e. device tries first to connect to the roaming partner and then if not possible attaches
to strongest network). All those Internet of Things (IoT) devices with “foreign” SIM will use the
roaming interface, i.e. even static devices like meters, fridges etc. may roam. IoT devices are
sometimes receiving commands via SMS (even industrial systems).
Network Function Virtualization (NFV) will also play an important role in 5G networks as
operators begin moving critical infrastructure and functions into the data center. Further study
needs to be considered for both Diameter and 5G security as these systems and networks are
deployed.
4.4 Protection against hacking of network nodes (Hardening)
The 3GPP has specified security requirements for the architecture, network elements and
interfaces to support mobility management. These requirements reduce the attack surface by
addressing key areas including service availability, system integrity, data security and access and
core network protections.
4.5 Signaling Aggregators
Aggregators provide wholesale SS7 interconnection capabilities for all types and size of service
providers. Acting as a hub, they have a wider view of signaling traffic originating from domestic
and international entities and terminating in the U.S. telecommunications network. This view
enables more robust monitoring and filtering across the traffic. The major aggregators could then
respond, similar to individual service providers in identifying malicious and suspicious traffic
using basic message filtering and data analytics applied to multiple message streams. Some
attack vectors like the identity of a malicious service provider endpoint may still be a problem.
However, extending the security controls at different interconnection points reduces the risk.

Final Report
4.6 Information Sharing
There has been much discussion around information sharing in the industry. The GSMA has
been exploring the possibility of operators sharing telecommunications focused security
breaches, and have established a template for the reporting of incidents. The template has
actually been put to use, and at least one operator recently submitted a security breach (SMS
intercept) to the GSMA FASG.
There already exists a framework for the sharing of incidents within the telecommunications
industry. The GSMA Fraud group actively shares fraud alerts with its members, and partners
with the Communications Fraud Control Association (CFCA) in information sharing.
Additionally, existing threat information sharing resources are outlined in the CSRIC Working
Group 5 report as it relates to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Coordinating
Center for Communications (NCC), the Communications Information Sharing and Analysis
Center (ISAC) and collaboration with law enforcement. Also, with the passage of the CISA
(Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act) in December 2015, the industry has undertaken to Pilot
automated information sharing use-cases specific to the telecommunications sector, inclusive of
SS7 scenarios and connection with the DHS Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) Portal.
Some form of telecommunications focused information sharing may assist operators in
developing business cases for the investment in security solutions. Without this ‘evidence’ of
intentional signaling abuse, malicious targeting of subscribers and active cyber security
breaches, it becomes impossible for security professionals to justify investments in security
solutions, and threats are viewed as ‘theoretical and academic.’ The question becomes who will
be responsible for the dissemination of these reports without risk of punitive actions against the
operator. A third party may be able to assist in managing this reporting and for ensuring the
reporting operators are not penalized. CTIA’s ongoing efforts on cybersecurity information
sharing within the communications sector could be a model for such third-party efforts.
4.7 Circles of Trust
As discussed in Section 9 of the Risk Assessment report, the 3GPP is studying the concept of
trust groups among telecommunications carriers. This could include, extending the
authentication framework across user devices, 3GPP and non-3GPP access and core networks
and third party services. Forming trust groups across as many upstream and downstream
interfaces as possible could be very beneficial, but it is unrealistic to expect global trust and
adoption across different types of operators, exchange operators and third party service
providers.
While the interconnection model could benefit from a global trust group model, such an approach
would need to begin with small steps that can be adapted, as circumstances change, and eventually
expanded.
For example, each network will have to deal with messages from partners with which it has the
same level of trust and those with different levels of trust. If a network has different levels inside

Final Report
its own network (e.g. global operator acting across different political areas) then the nodes in this
network need to be assigned to one or another trust level. This is particularly important if a node
or whole countries might become untrustworthy and thus an important task. In determining levels
of trust, companies will need to ask a number of questions: How well a network is protected
against attacks? Are the nodes hardened? Have regular risk assessments been performed? To
whom is the access rented out (wholesale business, MVNO etc.) and is their behavior monitored
and are those tenants following the rules? This assessment can rely upon hardening guidelines
(e.g. 3GPP TS 33.116 and TS 33.117), monitoring requirements for tenants (e.g. GSMA FS.11,
FS.07. FS.19), and legal rules. It may even include trusted hardware for localization purposes and
rules for NFV management or employee training against phishing and bribing. The first step is to
define what does trust mean and second what area is covered, i.e. U.S. or U.S. + selected partners.
When two trusted nodes communicate with each other, they need to use a secure direct
communication, that includes authentication, confidentially and integrity e.g. IPSec. For this a
Public Key Infrastructure is needed. A globally trusted PKI may not be feasible. Therefore, as a
trusted starting point, a regional trusted PKI may be sensible e.g. potentially run by some third
party. The same entity could also provide a revocation blacklist, which is important to identify
compromised nodes. All entities in the trust group adhering to the trust level principals could
obtain the needed cryptographic material.
A communication is only trustworthy if the whole communication chain is trustworthy. As
previously discussed, a message may traverse potentially untrusted nodes and becomes
untrustworthy. This could result in there being “two classes” of messages. It is important to note
that an interconnection or a backbone connectivity provider may actually be in several trust groups
and therefore have several classes of traffic e.g. untrusted, “RegionA-trusted”, “RegionB-trusted”.
It needs to be observed that those messages may need to be routed through different security
tunnels, as their trust is based on the credentials used for the tunnels.
4.8 Security Assessment of Signaling Infrastructure
It is critical that the signaling infrastructure maintains robust security for the signaling protocol,
network architecture, and supporting operations infrastructure. The WG recommends that
service providers periodically assess the security of their SS7 signaling infrastructure as
appropriate to identify any risks and then remediate the controls framework. This should either
be conducted by internal resources or an independent third party that has the necessary skillsets.
The security risk assessment may address different aspects, such as:
 Cover the SS7 protocol suite across all of the domestic and international
interconnection points
 Assess the people, processes and technology focused on security
 Identify any internal or external weaknesses
 Cover both the control and management planes in terms of security
configurations
 Fuzz testing to evaluate the robustness of the protocol filtering and data analytics
 Assess the supporting operations processes monitoring interconnection points
and responding to malicious and suspicious traffic
 Examine the lifecycle management of the supplier products in terms of patches,
updates and new security functionality

4.9 U.S. Critical Infrastructure Protection
Critical infrastructure (CI) includes different types of systems that provide goods and services
that support essential societal and government operations. As described in the Risk Assessment
critical infrastructures include the following sectors:
 Industrial Control Systems (ICS) for sensitive manufacturing and processing
operations (e.g., chemical plants, refineries, etc.).
 Banking and Finance
 Energy
 Water and Wastewater
 Emergency Services
 Communications
 Transportation
 Federal Government
CI Sectors may face different types of SS7 and possibly Diameter attacks including
location tracking, call interception, fraud and denial-of-service. Due to the importance
of critical infrastructures for delivery of essential societal functions, it is imperative that
SS7 and Diameter vulnerabilities be addressed effectively to ensure that U.S.
infrastructures remain resilient and avoid cascading failures. Resilient communications
requires on-going monitoring, filtering and threat information sharing.
4.10 Subscriber Encryption Support
The SS7 exploits described in the Risk Assessment conducted for CSRIC V by Working Group
10 and released in December 2016 are primarily effective because of their limited scope. The
use of SS7 for mass eavesdropping on calls or mass global tracking is easily detected in even the
least sophisticated network. These threats are designed for specific end user targeting and as
with any good defense in depth strategy, a layered approach can provide the best protection. A
consumer may be able to employ methods to protect the content of messages and voice
communications by using end to end encryption.
When making a call using a landline or mobile phone, the call is not encrypted end-to-end. Most
mobile phones do use some form of encryption over the air interface between the mobile device
and the towers. However, the call is delivered “in the clear” as it traverses the network and is
vulnerable to interception using the techniques that have been described earlier in the Risk
Assessment Report. End to end encryption means that the data is encrypted at the source device
with a user specific key and delivered to the end device where it is decrypted using the same
key. In practice, the complexity of key management and encryption/decryption is handled by
applications deployed at the end devices. There are a number of such applications available on
the market today, but the consumer needs to be wary that they are using an application that truly
encrypts end to end.
There are a number of sources that can be used as research references that provide further

Final Report
information on encryption methods and the ability to support voice, messaging and other data
types.6 For voice calls, there are a number of well-known services that offer end-to-end
encrypted VoIP capabilities and also traditional voice encryption. A few example applications
include:
 WhatsApp (https://www.whatsapp.com/)
 Signal (http://whispersystems.org/)
 Jitsi (https://jitisi.org/)
 Silent Phone (https://www.silentcircle.com/)
 Zphone (http://www.zfone.com/)
However, most popular VoIP provides, such as Skype and Google Hangouts, offer transport
encryption. Many of the apps are open source and free to use.
End to end encryption popularity has grown overseas, initially by users in China, Iran and the
Middle East, where users may be concerned about government surveillance. These apps have
continued to move more into the mainstream as awareness of privacy concerns by end users
grows. This may be one way for a consumer to protect the privacy of the content of
communications. Other more sophisticated tools exist that can be employed to protect this
metadata, such as using Tor over a secure IP connection.
For a VIP or key government official, the use of commercial applications that enable end-to-end
encryption provides another layer in the defense against potential information compromise by
SS7 enabled eavesdropping. The ease of use in these applications continues to improve and the
quality of service has improved as well. These are commercial grade encryption and are not
approved for transmission of any government security classified information. They are,
however, a convenient tool to protect sensitive but unclassified conversations for potential
targets of eavesdropping.
