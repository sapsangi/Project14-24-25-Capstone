DRAFT Final Report
1 Executive Summary
Cybersecurity refers to the technologies and techniques used to protect information and systems
from being stolen, compromised or attacked. This includes unauthorized or criminal use of
electronic data, attacks on networks and computers, and viruses and malicious codes.
Cybersecurity is a national priority and critical to the well-being of all organizations.1
Over the past five years, cyberattacks have been on the rise in frequency and impact. Headline
grabbing attacks at Sony Pictures exposed copyright content, company confidential data and
personal privacy information that forced Sony to shut down their online services for weeks. The
Ashley Madison data breach resulted in the exposure and public posting of some very personal
data. And, the Office of Personnel Management was the target of a persistent breach that
compromised tens of millions of records of personal information related to current and past
federal workers including security clearance information.
However, it is not just data that is being stolen. Researchers demonstrated the ease with which
they were able to wirelessly exploit and gain control of the steering, brakes and transmission of a
Jeep Cherokee. Recently, suspected state sponsored cyberattacks in the Ukraine caused a six
hour power outage for some 80,000 customers. This sophisticated and highly coordinated attack
combined Telephone Denial of Service (TDOS), hacked control systems, and compromised
monitoring to attack the critical infrastructure while “blinding” the utility operator from
detecting the problem. It is believed to be the first critical infrastructure attack of its kind and
underscores the national security implications of cybersecurity.
Anticipating the potential kinetic impacts of a cyberattack on critical infrastructure, President
Obama released Executive Order 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, citing
the need for improving cybersecurity in response to the repeated cyber intrusions into critical
infrastructure.2 The cornerstone of this order is the enhancement of security and resilience of
critical infrastructure through the voluntary, collaborative efforts of federal agencies and
commercial industry.
Cybersecurity professionals have unique skills, are in short supply, and are vital to our nation’s
security. As a result, competition for talent is fierce and establishing a strong team is essential.
This requires organizations to tailor how they plan for their cybersecurity workforce so they
have the right people in the right positions. In the White House Executive Order 13636,
Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, the President assigned the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) the leadership role to work with Federal Agencies and sector specific
regulators to help ensure we have skilled cybersecurity workers today and a strong pipeline of
future cybersecurity leaders. One of the results of this mission, is the collaborative effort with
the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) that resulted in the development of
the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF).3

Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
The mission of the Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (CSRIC
or Council) is to provide recommendations to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
to ensure, among other things, optimal security and reliability of communications systems.4
Furthermore, the Council’s recommendations specifically address the prevention and
remediation of detrimental cyber events. Working Group 7 of the CSRIC V is specifically
chartered to provide recommendations for the CSRIC’s consideration regarding any actions the
FCC should take to promote improvements in cybersecurity workforce development. 5
The CSRIC V Working Group 7 has been tasked to examine and develop recommendations for
the CSRIC’s consideration regarding any actions that the FCC should take to improve the
security of the nation’s critical communications infrastructure through actions to enhance the
transparency, skill validation, and best practices relating to recruitment, training, retention, and
job mobility of personnel within the cybersecurity field.
Specifically, this working group will leverage existing work in this context to enhance the
volume and quality of the workforce, including6:
(1) demonstrating the application of the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework
(NCWF) to the common and specialized work roles with in the communications sector;
(2) identifying any gaps or improvements in the NCWF for evolving work roles or skill sets
that should be included in sector members’ workforce planning; and
(3) identifying, developing, and recommending best practices and implementation thereof to
mitigate insider threats, including through scalable means to enhance transparency,
accountability and validation of skills, knowledge and abilities within the
communications sector and particularly with respect to personnel having access to the
most critical elements of the nation’s communications network assets. In this respect, the
working group should consider means to promote a common lexicon and roadmap that
will promote more effective interface with academic institutions and other training
environments.
This Final Report builds upon the Interim Report that specifically addressed the demonstration
of the applicability of the NCWF to the Communications Sector and the identification of gaps or
improvements to the NCWF. Further, it documents the approach that the Working Group 7
applied to identify, develop and recommend best practices for consideration by the CSRIC V
membership for inclusion in the Final Report. In order to manage the scale of the task, Working
Group 7 chose to segment the information gathering and analysis process with targeted findings
specific to each segment. We then identified best practices based on our analysis for each
segment for consideration. This Final Report presents those Best Practices deemed to be most
appropriate and impactful for consideration by the CSRIC V as recommendations to the FCC
and the Communications Industry as a whole.

Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
The National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF)7 provides a blueprint to categorize,
organize, and describe cybersecurity work into Categories, Specialty Areas, Competencies, and
KSAs.
1. Categories are common major functions regardless of job titles or other occupational
terms.
2. Specialty Areas are common types of cybersecurity work which are grouped with
similar areas under a specific Category.
3. Competencies are areas of expertise required for the successful performance of a job
function; these are defined in the framework through the association of specific KSAs.
4. Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) are the attributes required to perform a job and
are generally demonstrated through qualifying experience, education, or training
experience, education, or training.
Working Group 7 (WG7) leveraged the prior NCWF analysis and process completed by the
Financial Sector as a best practice to accelerate our task of evaluating the NCWF. The summary
conclusions are that the NCWF is a viable, flexible framework that can and should be applied to
the Communications Sector for Cybersecurity Workforce Development Planning. Building on
this finding by the Working Group members, we proceeded to complete the initial evaluation of
the “building blocks” – Categories, Specialty Areas, Competencies, and KSAs – for gaps and
improvements that should be included in the application of this dataset to the Communications
Sector. Our work product is attached to this Final Report as Appendices 1 and 2. It was also
delivered to the FCC as a working database in Microsoft Excel format for unrestricted use.
We recognize that cybersecurity workforce development is undergoing rapid change and
evolution. This Final Report provides a lexicon that can be used to articulate the specific
Workforce needs of the Communications Sector for roles involving cybersecurity. However, it is
a static dataset and needs to evolve as the NCWF matures and Cybersecurity Workforce
Development Planning gains maturity in our respective organizations. As part of the Final
Report, WG7 provides specific recommendations for consideration by CSRIC on a process for
adaptation and improvement of the sector specific dataset.
2 Introduction
In February of 2013, the White House released Executive Order 13636, Improving Critical
Infrastructure Cybersecurity, citing the need for improving cybersecurity in response to the
repeated cyber intrusions into critical infrastructure.8 The cornerstone of this order is the
enhancement of security and resilience of critical infrastructure through the voluntary,
collaborative efforts of federal agencies and commercial industry.
The Executive Order assigned the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
develop a flexible cybersecurity framework for critical infrastructure protection that could be
adapted to meet the specific needs of individual sectors. The Order also calls for the Department
of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide technical assistance to agencies in the development of
their cybersecurity workforce and programs.

Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
A national effort to draft a Cybersecurity Workforce Framework began in 2010 with more than
20 Federal Departments and Agencies contributing to the initial drafting process. A draft of the
National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework was posted for public comments in September
2011 in conjunction with the Second Annual NICE Conference9 hosted by NIST. The National
Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF) version 1.0 was posted in April 2013 to the
National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) website. Subsequently, DHS began to
work on updating the NCWF by seeking input from across the private sector, academia, and
government. NCWF version 2.0 was posted by DHS to its cybersecurity workforce portal in
April 2014. DOD, DHS, and the NICE program office at NIST developed an updated draft
special publication of the NCWF released by NIST for public comments in November of 2016
that adds cyber work roles and the associated Knowledge, Skills, Abilities (KSAs) into a
national cyber workforce framework.10
The Executive Order further calls for the sector specific government agencies to engage in a
consultative process with DHS and other affected parties to consider prioritized actions to
mitigate cyber risks for critical infrastructure in a voluntary and collaborative partnership. The
mission of the Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) is to
provide recommendations to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to ensure, among
other things, optimal security and reliability of communications systems.11 Furthermore, the
Council’s recommendations specifically address the prevention and remediation of detrimental
cyber events. Working Group 7 of the CSRIC V is specifically chartered to provide
recommendations for the CSRIC’s consideration regarding any actions the FCC should take to
promote improvements in cybersecurity workforce development.12
A joint survey published by ISACA and the RSA Conference in 2015 indicated that over 80% of
corporations expected a cyberattack in the current calendar year. The same report estimated that
35% of corporations are unable to fill their open positions with qualified cybersecurity
personnel. Furthermore, less than half of the corporations surveyed believed that their current
security teams had the necessary skills and tools to enable them to detect and respond to
complex incidents. According to a report published in October of 2015, “Securing our Future:
Closing the Cybersecurity Talent Gap”, jointly published by Raytheon and the National Cyber
Security Alliance (NCSA), there were almost 240,000 job postings for cybersecurity-related job
openings in 2014, a 91 percent increase from 2010. More recently, Symantec estimated the
number at 300,000. Regardless of the source, it is painfully clear that industry is still not closing
the cybersecurity workforce gap.
The National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF)13 provides a blueprint to
categorize, organize, and describe cybersecurity work into Categories, Specialty Areas,
Competencies, and KSAs.

Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
1. Categories are common major functions regardless of job titles or other occupational
terms. The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) published
NCWF includes seven Categories: Securely Provision, Operate and Maintain, Collect
and Operate, Analyze, Protect and Defend, Oversight and Development, and Investigate.
2. Specialty Areas are common types of cybersecurity work which are grouped with
similar areas under a specific Category. The NCWF defines 31 Specialty Areas.
3. Competencies are areas of expertise required for the successful performance of a job
function; these are defined in the framework through the association of specific KSAs.
NICCS identifies 65 Competencies.
4. Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) are the attributes required to perform a job and
are generally demonstrated through qualifying experience, education, or training
experience, education, or training. Knowledge is a body of information applied directly
to the performance of a function. Skill is an observable competence to perform a learned
psychomotor act. Ability is competence to perform an observable behavior or a behavior
that results in an observable product. The NCWF defines 369 KSAs that can be each
associated with one or more Specialty Areas.
By using these basic building blocks to provide a common language to speak about cyber roles
and jobs, the NCWF helps to define professional requirements in cybersecurity regardless of
organizational structure or job titles. It has been developed largely with input from the Federal
Government and is currently being refined by the nation’s cybersecurity stakeholders, including
academia, professional, and non-profit organizations, and private industry. It is meant to be
flexible and organizations are encouraged to use it as a general guide to fit their specific needs.
Some examples include:
• Standardize how positions are managed and described by populating position
descriptions with Tasks and KSAs from the Workforce Framework.
• Incorporate Tasks and KSAs into job advertisements to attract candidates who can
perform needed job functions.
• Develop career paths that outline the Tasks and KSAs staff need to perform to progress
to the next level.
While some of the NCWF is based on Federal Government programs, any organization can
customize it as needed. A more comprehensive overview of the NCWF is available at the
National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS).14
14 The Draft NIST Special Publication 800-181 that updates the NCWF includes the addition of
Work Roles to the components used to organize roles and responsibilities resulting in the
following updated common set of components:
• Categories – A high-level grouping of common cybersecurity functions;
• Specialty Areas – Distinct areas of cybersecurity work;
• Work roles – The most detailed groupings of IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related work,
which include specific knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform a set of tasks;
• Tasks – Specific work activities that could be assigned to the professional working in
one of the NCWF’s Work Roles; and
• Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) – Attributes required to perform Tasks,
demonstrated through relevant experience or performance-based education and training.

3 Background
A skilled cybersecurity workforce is needed to meet the unique cybersecurity needs of critical
infrastructure. There is a well-documented shortage of general cybersecurity experts; however,
there is an even more acute shortage of qualified cybersecurity experts who also have an
understanding of the unique challenges to critical infrastructure. As the cybersecurity threat and
technology environment evolves, the cybersecurity workforce must continue to adapt to design,
develop, implement, maintain and continuously improve the necessary cybersecurity practices
Page 10 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
within critical infrastructure environments.
To address this accelerating gap, the Federal government established the National Initiative for
Cybersecurity Education (NICE). NICE is led by NIST as a collaborative effort involving
Federal, academic, and industry partners with the mission to energize and promote a robust
network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development.
Various efforts, including NICE, seek to accelerate learning and skills development, nurture a
diverse learning community, and guide career development and workforce planning.
Organizations must understand their current and future cybersecurity workforce needs, and
develop hiring, acquisition, and training resources to raise the level of technical competence of
those who build, operate, and defend systems delivering critical infrastructure services.15
3.1 Cybersecurity Workforce Planning16
Workforce planning is a systematic way for organizations to determine future human capital
requirements (demand), identify current human capital capabilities (supply), and design and
implement strategies to transition the current workforce to the desired future work state. Best in
class workforce planning is designed in a repeatable and reliable fashion, highlighting risks and
forecasting needs over time.
Effective workforce planning highlights potential risk areas associated with aligning the
workforce to work requirements. Applied correctly, workforce planning allows organizations to
adjust resources to meet future workloads, patterns of work, and fundamental changes in how
work is accomplished. A workforce planning approach must fit the needs of a specific
organization and account for unique characteristics of the cybersecurity profession.
Leading practice workforce planning consists of three components:
• Process: Establishing an integrated and consistent means of diagnosing workforce needs
and risks. This includes a defined model, data, and analytics.
• Strategy: Providing a direct line of sight between business and workforce requirements.
This includes a shared vision, governance, and continuous monitoring or performance.
• Infrastructure: Supporting execution of an effective and repeatable workforce planning
process. This includes a healthy workforce of people, collaboration across levels and
enabling technology.
Using a Workforce Planning Process, such as the example provided below, an organization can
conduct a cybersecurity workforce and workload analysis, enabling it to identify current and
future needs and potential gaps which may impact an organization’s ability to meet goals and
objectives.

Page 11 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
Figure 1 – Example Workforce Planning Process
Additionally, cybersecurity workforce planning requires a shared vision and performance
management. A shared vision provides a common language and taxonomy to define
cybersecurity workload and workforce allowing agile response to emerging technology and new
threats. Performance management is also key to evaluating cybersecurity professionals’ skills
within specific technology-based specialties. The National Cybersecurity Workforce
Framework provides additional support to organizations in considering this critical aspect of
cybersecurity workforce planning.
One of the most important aspects of workforce planning is identifying the workforce and
workload requirements that impact the nature of the work performed. Workload and workforce
requirements are the unique characteristics that make one profession different from another, and
may change how workforce planning is executed for that workload or workforce. DHS found
unique workload and workforce requirements specifically important to cybersecurity.
Workload Requirements:
• Surge Capacity– the need to expand resources and capabilities in response to prolonged
demand.
• Fast-paced– the need to sustain multiple work streams occurring rapidly.
• Transformative– the need to adapt to fundamental changes to technology, processes, and
threats.
• High Complexity– the need to employ a large number of intricate technologies and
concepts.
Page 12 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
Workforce Requirements:
• Agile– the ability to shift between roles or needs should a threat warrant different
support.
• Multi-functional– the ability to maintain and execute a variety of activities at any given
time.
• Dynamic– the ability to provide for constant learning to effectively approach new
endeavors and problems.
• Flexible– the ability to move into new roles or environments quickly to increase
knowledge and skills.
• Informal– the ability to work in a nontraditional environment.
Coupled with workforce planning best practices, these requirements help identify workforce
planning needs as they apply to cybersecurity.
DHS recommends cybersecurity workforce planning use a two-pronged approach. As outlined
above organizations should use workforce planning to identify cybersecurity skills, proficiency
gaps and workload. Organizations should develop an approach that integrates best practices for
workforce planning specific to cybersecurity with the seven categories of the National
Cybersecurity Workforce Framework—providing a standardized and categorized way from
which to build this approach. Secondly, organizations should use a capability maturity model to
apply the elements of best practice workforce planning to analyze their cybersecurity
requirements and maturity needs.
3.2 The DHS Capability Maturity Model (CMM)
As the cybersecurity workforce continues to evolve, and organizations track and manage against
the changing cybersecurity environment, understanding where current workforce planning
capabilities lie and how to develop those capabilities has become increasingly important.
A capability maturity model (CMM) provides a structure for organizations to baseline current
capabilities in cybersecurity workforce planning, setting a foundation and consistency of
evaluation. It allows organizations to compare their capabilities to one another, and enables
leaders to make better decisions about how to support progression and what cybersecurity
human capital initiative investments to make.
DHS’s CMM segments key activities into three main areas: 1) process and analytics, 2)
integrated governance, and 3) skilled practitioners and enabling technology.
Process represents those activities associated with the actual steps an organization takes to
perform workforce planning and how those steps are integrated with other important business
processes throughout the organization. Analytics represents those activities associated with
supply and demand data and the use of tools, models, and methods to perform workforce
planning analysis.
Integrated governance represents those activities associated with establishing governance
structures, developing and providing guidance, and driving decision-making. It is the building
block to an organization’s overall workforce planning strategy and vision as well as assignments
of responsibility, promotion of integration, and issuing of planning guidance.

DRAFT Final Report
Skilled Practitioners represents the activities associated with establishing a professional cadre
of workforce planners within an organization. Enabling Technology represents the activities
associated with the accessibility and use of data systems.
3.3 Using the DHS Maturity Model
The DHS Cybersecurity Workforce Planning CMM has three maturity levels. These levels are
limited, progressing, and optimizing. Limited is the most basic level, portraying a key activity
area or segment of an organization’s cybersecurity workforce planning capability that is in its
infancy. This level of capability is at its start of development and may be represented by an
organization having limited establishment of processes, lacking clear guidance or having little in
terms of data and analysis methods. The progressing level describes a key activity area of some
aspect of cybersecurity workforce planning which an organization has started to perform,
commonly represented by an organization establishing some infrastructure to support workforce
planning efforts. The final level of maturity, optimizing, depicts a key activity area or segment
of cybersecurity workforce planning capability that has fully developed, such as one that is
integrated with other business processes and can support different levels of workforce and
workload analysis, the results of which drive short and long term decision making for the
cybersecurity workforce.
It is important to note that organizations will have differing goals when it comes to the
maturation of the cybersecurity workforce planning capability and that all organizations do not
need to reach the optimizing state for all key areas. This decision should take into account many
different variables. Leaders need to assess the impacts of: allocation of resources,
implementation, timing, and return on their investments. Therefore, organizations should view
their maturity rankings less as a grade or judgment and more as an indication of resources spent
on workforce planning. Having a “limited” maturity level does not equate to “bad” workforce
planning, but rather that the organization has not dedicated resources to partially or fully develop
that aspect of the maturity model, and that there are extenuating circumstances for that outcome.
In order to use the model, organizations must have an accurate understanding of their current
workforce planning capabilities as they relate to the three segment areas, with the ability to site
specific evidence of conducting related activities. An organization’s current capability is the
springboard upon which to build further maturity, using the CMM to pinpoint necessary next
steps and decision points for progression. DHS recommends a three-step process to using the
CMM to determine an organization’s current cybersecurity workforce planning capability and
progress individual organizational maturity along the continuum:
• Gather data on qualitative CMM variables;
• Analyze data and determine current maturity levels by CMM key area; and
• Determine priority areas for increased maturity and develop action plans.

Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
4 Objective, Scope, and Methodology17
4.1 Objective
The CSRIC V Working group 7 has been tasked to examine and develop recommendations for
the CSRIC’s consideration regarding any actions that the FCC should take to improve the
security of the nation’s critical communications infrastructure through actions to enhance the
transparency, skill validation, and best practices relating to recruitment, training, retention, and
job mobility of personnel within the cybersecurity field.
4.2 Scope
Specifically, this working group leveraged existing work in the context to enhance the volume
and quality of the workforce, including18:
• demonstrating the application of the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework
(NCWF) to the common and specialized work roles with in the communications sector;
• identifying any gaps or improvements in the NCWF for evolving work roles or skill sets
that should be included in sector members’ workforce planning;
• identifying, developing, and recommending best practices and implementation thereof to
mitigate insider threats, including through scalable means to enhance transparency,
accountability and validation of skills, knowledge and abilities within the
communications sector and particularly with respect to personnel having access to the
most critical elements of the nation’s communications network assets; and
• considering means to promote a common lexicon and roadmap that will promote more
effective interface with academic institutions and other training environments.
4.3 Methodology
The approach that Working Group 7 (WG7) undertook to address the cybersecurity workforce
development tasking assigned by CSRIC V was to address the basics of a common lexicon
based on the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF) model first. Once these
building blocks were completed, we undertook a survey of different stakeholders representing
various segments of the communications sector to understand current best practices in
cybersecurity workforce development. The resulting data was analyzed to produce
recommendations that were approved by the Working Group membership for presentation to the
CSRIC.
4.3.1 Evaluate National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework
As a starting point, we elected to begin by reviewing a similar work product completed by the
Financial Sector in cooperation with the Cybersecurity Workforce Alliance (CWA). WG7
Members focused on defining the role profiles from an extended baseline of the NCWF
Specialty Areas, Competencies, and KSAs instead of starting our work from scratch. WG7
leveraged the CWA data set and process developed in support of the Financial Sector as our
17 CSRIC V Working Group Descriptions and Leadership, last updated, 1/27/2016
18 The FCC CSRIC Working Group Description references the NICE CWF; Working Group 7
has opted to refer to this framework using the NICCS designation of the National Cybersecurity
Workforce Framework (NCWF) for external consistency
Page 15 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
starting point. The CWA data set was the result of a similar sector specific assessment of the
NCWF. Our approach was to leverage:
• the extended Workforce Profiles and Roles already developed for the Finance sector as a
starting point, and
• the direct experience from CWA representatives in extending the taxonomy to address
gaps or improvements.
Figure 2 - NCWF Evaluation Process
The resulting taxonomy that was captured in the information base during the first part of the Gap
Analysis is available to be shared across the communications sector. It is included in Appendices
1 and 2 to this Final Report.
4.3.1.1 Application of NCWF to the Communications Sector
The first task of the Working Group was to demonstrate the application of the National
Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF) to the common and specialized work roles with
in the Communications Sector. For each Category, Specialty Area, Competency, and KSA, the
Working Group members were surveyed to assess specifically if the existing entry in the NCWF
was applicable to the Communications Sector. As our Working Group including a diverse subset
of the overall Communications Sector, Public Safety, Federal/Local Government, and
Academia, an internal survey of the membership provided a broad assessment of the
applicability of the NCWF to our sector. The inputs were then aggregated and reviewed by the
Working Group as a whole. The recommendation from the membership was to be inclusive in
our assessment of the NCWF – meaning that we did not remove any of the specific KSAs,
Competencies, etc. in the data set we were provided even if the specific entry might not be
directly applicable to a specific member of the sector. As a result, we were unanimous in our
determination that the model is in fact applicable to the Communications sector and that the
expansion of the component data by the Financial Sector was also applicable.

Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
4.3.1.2 Identify Gaps and Improvements
After accepting the NCWF as an applicable structure to develop a common language to describe
cybersecurity work, we proceeded to identify any gaps or improvements in the NCWF for
evolving work roles or skill sets that should be included in sector members’ workforce planning.
Again, each of the Working Group members were tasked to review the KSAs, Competencies,
Specialty Areas, and Categories for any gaps or modifications to better reflect the specific needs
of their segment of the Communications Sector. This data was aggregated and distributed to the
membership for final comment and approval. The resulting dataset detail is included in
Appendices 1 and 2 to this report.
Figure 3 - Summary Data from NCWF Gap Identification
4.3.2 Identify, develop and recommend Best Practices
The second phase of the Working Group assignment is to identify, develop and recommend best
practices and implementation thereof to mitigate insider threats within the communications
sector including through scalable means to enhance transparency, accountability and validation
of skills, knowledge and abilities, particularly with respect to personnel having access to the
most critical elements of the nation’s communications network assets. The approach we
followed was to survey constituent members of the Communications Sector on their workforce
planning programs as they related to cybersecurity and more specifically the National
Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. We also gathered experiential data from outside the
Communications Industry sector, specifically from Academia, Federal Government and State
Government to provide insight into the best practices, policies and tools developed as a result of
these different implementations of the NCWF.
Page 17 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
4.3.2.1 Communications Industry
The Working Group members reviewed their current company internal workforce planning
procedures and specifically, cybersecurity workforce development, to provide “sanitized”
examples of best practices, policies, and tools that can be shared externally with the FCC and
Communications Sector companies.
4.3.2.2 Academic Segment
There are current multiple Academic, Government and industry organizations reviewing
cybersecurity education curriculum. These include the Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM) and the NSA/DHS joint effort to designate National Centers of Academic Excellence in
Information Assurance (IA)/Cyber Defense (CD). The members of the Academic Segment have
made it clear that there is a need to agree on a common core for cybersecurity curriculum that
meets the needs of the education marketplace and takes into consideration the different types of
institutions and their goals. WG7 cataloged various initiatives that are ongoing across the
Academic community with the participation of industry and government to define cybersecurity
education curriculum and the challenges they face.
In addition to the activities focused on curriculum development, the WG7 identified and
reviewed various programs representing successful partnerships between Government, Industry
and Academia to expand the talent pool available to seek education in areas of study that would
prepare them to fill openings in the cybersecurity workforce. These programs vary across the
communities served and the methods employed but they serve a common purpose in that they
are encouraging more students to pursue academic studies in the disciplines necessary to support
the growing demand. The result of this data gathering and analysis informed our findings to
provide guidance to the CSRIC on recommendations for the FCC to enhance workforce
development.
4.3.2.3 Public Safety
Public Safety networks are undergoing a transformational evolution from TDM networks to the
Internet Protocol based Next Generation to support 911 emergency call handling. At the same
time, FirstNet is anticipated to completely change the way First Responders will interact with
each other and share data with local, regional and even Federal entities. The December 2015
FCC Task Force on Optimal PSAP Architecture report from Working Group 1 on cybersecurity
was tasked
“…to address the issues of increasing exposure to cyber threats and vulnerabilities that
did not exist in the legacy 9-1-1 environment, and develop recommendations for PSAP-
specific cybersecurity practices based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and other
foundational resources that include the results of Federal cybersecurity focused reports
and activities of CSRIC and DHS; industry specific standards bodies such as NENA,
APCO, and ATIS; and commercial industry best practices.”19
This report included a discussion providing guidance on leveraging the NCWF for the
development of training programs specific to the needs of the Public Safety segment. The

DRAFT Final Report
Working Group reviewed this guidance to identify opportunities for and impediments to
execution.
4.3.2.4 Financial Sector
Working Group 7 leveraged work done by the CWA in support of the Financial Sector as part of
our review of the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. In this section, we review
some of the lessons learned and practices from the Financial Sector as part of their initiative to
tackle the cybersecurity workforce development gap. By leveraging the work already completed,
and supporting their ongoing activities intended to inform the NCWF version 2.0 development
of roles and related updates, WG7 intends to establish a recurring process for Communications
Industry continuing participation in the evolution of the NCWF to assure our industry
requirements are included in future publications of the guiding standards.
4.3.2.5 Federal Sector
The 2013 Executive Order on Critical Infrastructure Security assigns roles for the adoption of
the cybersecurity framework for critical infrastructure protection20 and specifically calls for the
Department of Homeland Security to coordinate the provision of technical assistance to agencies
on the development of their cybersecurity workforce.21 The Working Group conducted a review
of the DHS NICCS22 available tools, practices, and policies for Cybersecurity Workforce
Development23 that have been leveraged by Federal Sector agencies. Further, WG7 reviewed
guidance provided by the recent focus on workforce in both the Cybersecurity Strategy and
Implementation Plan (CSIP) for the Federal Civilian Government24 (October 2015), and the
workforce aspects of the Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP).25
Specific activities and programs within the Department of Defense, citing the emerging change
in training focus from certification based to KSA focused metrics driven, representing best
practices in cybersecurity training, were included in our review. Another notable program
intended to inform best practices is the OPM Scholarship For Service program. WG7 members
met with representatives from OPM to understand the specifics of the program. As a result of
these activities, WG7 identified a number of example best practices currently in use by the
Federal Sector that were assessed for applicability to the Communications Industry.
4.3.2.6 State Government Sector
The National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO) in partnership with
Deloitte conducted a cybersecurity study in 2014 based on a comprehensive survey of State
Chief Information Officers. Among the summary findings of the report, the cybersecurity
workforce gap was specifically called out as a talent crisis:

Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
“The skill sets needed for effective cybersecurity protection and monitoring are in heavy
demand across all sectors. State CISOs are struggling to recruit and retain people with
the right skills, and they will need to establish career growth paths and find creative ways
to build their cybersecurity teams.”26
In addition to the activities of national organizations, many State governments are pursuing
programs meant to address the cybersecurity workforce development challenge. For example,
the Workforce Development and Education Subcommittee of the State of California’s Office of
Emergency Services is currently pursuing a program to “develop a consistent definition and
criteria for cybersecurity expertise to serve the State of California”. The WG7 members also
engaged with the NICE Working Group (NICEWG)27 subgroups to leverage their extended
reach across the Nation to identify state and local progress in areas of transparency, skill
validation, and best practices relating to recruitment, training, retention, and job mobility of
personnel within the cybersecurity field. The NICEWG has been established to provide a
mechanism by which public and private sector participants can develop concepts, design
strategies, and pursue actions that advance cybersecurity education, training, and workforce
development.
The Working Group consolidated the information gathered from this sample of ongoing
workforce development program activities in support of State government cybersecurity needs.
The purpose here was not to create an exhaustive compendium, but rather to provide examples
of active programs with the purpose of providing insights into current State actions, policies and
tools to inform the CSRIC V members.
5 Findings
5.1 Analysis of the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework
Development of a common framework for describing cybersecurity work enables employers to
develop job descriptions that reflect the specific and critical knowledge, skills, and abilities with
a consistent format and language. The development of this common lexicon enables the various
constituents of the workforce planning supply chain to be more efficient in communicating
specific requirements in a consistent and replicable manner. The end result is a convergence of
efforts across a common framework to address the nation’s cybersecurity workforce
development requirements. This convergence requires a cooperative effort involving Academia,
Government, and Industry to align on a common lexicon and framework. It does not require the
mandate of a set of the same tools, curriculum, processes and policies. With that in mind, the
CSRIC V Working Group 7, Workforce Development, focused on identifying and documenting
the “building blocks” of a common lexicon and identifying current best practices for
cybersecurity workforce development that can then be used by Industry, Academia, and
Government to accelerate the development and implementation of their specific planning
processes.

Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
5.1.1 Application of the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF) to
the Communications Sector
In evaluating the value of the NCWF, we further agreed with the inputs from Government
representatives based on the collective review from NIST, DHS and the Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD) that the Cybersecurity Workforce Framework and the recently released draft
cyber workforce special publication:
• Provides organizations with the common lexicon that categorize and describe
cybersecurity work, as well as the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform
tasks that constitute cybersecurity work;
• Improves communication among organizations to help identify, recruit, and develop
cyber talent;
• Enables employers to standardize professional development, certifications, and training;
• Facilitates a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach to select and specify
cybersecurity work roles for positions within organizations;
• Provides a stable yet flexible catalog of tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities for each
cybersecurity work role to meet both the current and future needs based on changing
threats, requirements, and technologies; and
• Enables academic institutions to align curricula to the Workforce Framework and teach
the knowledge necessary for students to effectively join the cybersecurity workforce.
The Working Group 7 membership unanimously agreed that the NCWF is applicable to the
Communications Sector. We then focused on the data elements in the NCWF to develop a sector
specific dataset that would form the initial baseline for describing cybersecurity work.
5.1.2 Identify Gaps and Improvements in the NCWF
The majority of KSAs were found to be common across industry sectors. There were less than a
half dozen KSAs that were deemed not applicable to the Communications Sector from the initial
working data set developed for the financial sector by the CWA. Almost all of the KSAs
reviewed by WG7 participants were common across their specific representative segment. We
did find that Public Safety environment and Radio/Telecommunications technology specific
KSAs were lacking in the initial data set reviewed and these were added by WG7.
The level of experience in a specific KSA can vary for roles within an organization. For
example, entry level positions can be expected to understand the lexicon and execute routine
tasks associated with a KSA under direction of more skilled leadership while Subject Matter
Experts are expected to be able to apply KSAs in creative problem solving. As the specific
nature of the roles required to staff a cybersecurity workforce vary greatly depending on the
needs of the segment participants, this becomes a specific application of the dataset and is
considered beyond the scope of the initial research conducted by this working group.
5.2 Findings Informed by Identification of Best Practices
As noted earlier in the methodology section, the Working Group gathered data from a diverse
set of segments directly and indirectly related to the Communications Industry. The methods
used for information gathering included interviews, data searches, presentations from Subject
Matter Experts, review of internal business practices and workforce development programs, and
Page 21 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council

active participation in multiple organizations both public and private involved in addressing the
cybersecurity workforce development challenge. Throughout this section on Findings, there are
multiple referenced materials included in the Appendices to this document intended to further
inform the reader concerning specific programs, tools, and strategies that formed the basis of the
Best Practices and Recommendations of this Working Group. The first Subject Matter Expert
presentation was provided by Benjamin Scribner of the Department of Homeland Security,
National Cybersecurity Education & Awareness Branch (CE&A) and is included in Appendix 5.
This presentation provides an excellent overview of the Workforce Development challenge and
some of the Best Practices currently being employed by the Federal Government. The following
sections describe the findings by each of the six segments the Working Group pursued to
develop Recommendations and Best Practices for this final report.
5.3 Communications Industry
A balanced, holistic approach that contemplates investment in programs geared at younger
students, cultivating the emerging workforce through curriculum development with colleges and
universities, and training or re-training the existing workforce is key to successful workforce
development for member organizations in the Communications Industry. The NICCS (National
Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies) articulates four fundamental practices for
developing a cybersecurity workforce as depicted in Figure 4 below.
Figure 4 - Foundational Practices for Developing a Cybersecurity Workforce
Page 22 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
Although variations did exist, we found that in general these practices are foundational and
appear consistently in our findings:
• Understand workforce needs and skills gap;
• Hire the right people for clearly defined roles;
• Enhance employee skills once they enter the organization; and
• Create an environment and implement programs that retain top talent.
5.3.1 Benchmark the Organization
1. Organizational Structure
a. Perform Gap analysis on organization
b. Review organizational structure to confirm applicability
c. Identify key drivers for business and how security needs to align
2. Develop Partnerships with the business
3. Identify Specialty Security Areas
4. Define Emerging Skills and Pivotal Roles - While all roles are important, pivotal roles
are identified as roles that have significant impact the strategy and drive a
disproportionate value to the organization.
a. Long to recruit and develop
b. More expensive to buy
c. Difficult to retain due to high in demand skills and experiences.
5. Balance Technical versus Soft Skills – Technical skills have been the focus there is an
importance for soft skills as well
a. Business acumen
b. People management
c. Communication
5.3.2 Work Model
1. Work Growth – How does work grow and how and by whom is it being performed
across the organization
a. Identify how work grows and determine contribution based on level of worker
b. Review expected contribution vs actual contribution of employees within a given
level (Is work being performed at correct level)
2. Job Levels – Create proper job levels for the work being performed
a. Utilize all levels for security roles
b. Indicate specialized roles where only senior levels are used
3. Talent Movement - Pursue diverse talent through various sources
4. Career Management
a. Create sustainable talent development strategy
b. Re-think or build strategy for hires
c. Create hybrid roles
Page 23 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
d. Flexible work arrangements
e. Provide clarity on career paths
5.3.3 Examples of Currently Active Programs
Industry leaders have identified several programs they have put in place designed to find the best
and the brightest minds in diverse fields of study to include security.
1. Campus to Career
a. Internships and Co-ops
b. Entry-level
c. Leadership Development Programs
d. Partnerships
2. Collaborate with learning institutions to create custom designed training /certificate
programs that strengthen the workforce and build shareholder value.
3. Conferences and career fairs
4. Established solid relationships with certain universities for recruiting new graduates. We
continue to explore new programs dedicated to cybersecurity degrees as the programs
mature.
5. Recruit STEM degree graduates from universities in specific areas including
cybersecurity into internal programs that rotate new hires through several cybersecurity
roles in the company over the course of a few years, prior to permanent assignment in a
specific role for the longer term. This gives new graduates a better picture over the
company’s cybersecurity efforts from many angles before deciding on a career path
within the company.
6. Fund and support many different programs and events that engage the workforce at
younger ages including Girls That Code, hack-a-thons and local programs designed to
foster interest in STEM careers generally, and cybersecurity careers specifically in high
school students.
5.3.4 Continuing education for workforce
By offering certifications in cybersecurity to existing employees through a partnership program
with a college, corporations are able to “retool” the existing workforce. One example program
offers a cybersecurity certificate to existing employees following completion of several
progressively built courses including:
1. The foundations of cybersecurity
2. Network security
3. Mobile security
4. Emerging threats and defenses
5. Ethical hacking
6. Policy analysis and implementation
Though the development of an internal education program, one industry participant was able to
offer many cybersecurity training courses and established a badging program to encourage
Page 24 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
employees to develop their skills. They also offer industry standard training and fund industry
certification testing through third parties.
1. For example, in 2016 they funded 78 people to take Certified Information Systems
Security Professional (CISSP) training and the corresponding certification exam through
a 3rd party.
2. They also funded 150 people to take one of three different GIAC training programs and
the corresponding Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) certification exam
through a 3rd party. The training classes they funded lead to the following certifications:
a. GIAC Information Security Fundamentals (GISF)
b. GIAC Security Essentials Certification (GSEC)
c. GIAC Certified Enterprise Defender (GCED)
5.3.5 Combining skilled practitioners to address challenging positions
Data Scientists with security knowledge can be among the more difficult positions to fill. As a
solution to this challenge, one company pairs a pure data scientist with a security analyst that
will compensate for lack of people who can do both. In order to better fill this need in the
future, the following programs were then designed to train and re-train employees in particular
fields to broaden their skill into another:
a. A certification in Data Science through an online education resource
b. Online Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics through a university
c. A hybrid Online Master of Science in Data Science through a partnership with a
university
d. Development of a nanodegree program in Data Analysis.
5.3.6 List of candidate best practices from Industry Findings
1. Foster an organizational culture that embraces cybersecurity throughout the organization,
starting with the tone from the top executives. Cybersecurity professionals are
passionate about the work they perform and need to feel connected with an organization
that recognizes and values the need for an in-house cybersecurity workforce. (e.g., Cyber
Savvy Program)
2. Engage with colleges and universities to support cybersecurity directed research (e.g., IIS
UConn program), and internships. Fostering academic relationships strengthens the
reputation of industry cybersecurity programs, provides valued intellectual capital and
thought leadership, and can be a source for resource/skill gaps.
3. Develop engaging internship roles with clearly defined expectations/deliverables that
provide value to the company and the individual. Ensure the intern has the opportunity to
explore several cybersecurity functions within IIS, in addition to their internship role.
Enabling the intern to appreciate the depth and breadth of the cybersecurity program will
assist with recruiting for future interns and permanent roles.
4. Establish well-defined career paths with supporting job requirements and key
competencies to support both technical and management roles. This element is critically
important for recruiting and retention.
Page 25 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
5. Ensure competitive pay aligned with experience. The shortage of cybersecurity
resources is driving increased salaries for highly experienced individuals. Aligning to
these external forces is critical for recruiting and retaining key roles. Periodic review of
pay scales against these market forces is critical for ongoing retention of loyal staff
members, whose salary positions tend to erode over time.
6. Foster personal development through conferences, external training, on-the-job or cross
training, job shadowing, innovation labs and stretch assignments. Encourage the staff to
leverage mentoring programs. Critical for success, ensure development programs are
more than adequately funded and supported by the cybersecurity leadership team.
Enabling development opportunities, including setting aside sufficient time for the staff
to avail themselves is also critically important.
7. Encourage cybersecurity staff to become active industry participants. Cybersecurity,
telecom, and cable consortiums provide opportunities for staff members to explore
interesting topics, shape public policy, collaborate with peers, work with leading edge
vendors, present a conferences and publish articles in trade journals.
8. Push for cybersecurity process automation to keep the staff focused on what’s
important. A strong cybersecurity culture and personal development won’t mean much if
the infosec team is constantly focused on mundane manual tasks. Embrace process
automation and managed services to free up the security team to focus on high-priority,
high-intelligence activities.
9. Recognize key accomplishments for the cybersecurity staff, reinforcing and recognizing
the value that each staff member brings to the organization. Encourage shameless self-
promotion both internally and externally. Promote participation in industry recognized
award programs, such as ISE and SC Awards for team accomplishments.
5.4 Academic Segment
In order to better inform the CSRIC V, the Working Group believes it is valuable to include a
discussion of the broader challenge facing academia with respect to cybersecurity education.
This section includes a brief discussion of how the University of Washington has begun to
approach the cybersecurity gap through development of an innovative curricular model to
holistically address the development of future cybersecurity professionals. Their holistic
approach endeavors to produce cybersecurity (in their context, Information Assurance)
graduates with the requisite problem solving skills and the short amount of time that a
University educational program offers.

Figure 5: The KBP Pedagogical Model: CIAC as a pedagogical system28
“The KBP [depicted in Figure 5] is composed of five model elements—students,
teachers, goals, content and didactic processes—the first two of which are intelligent
elements, the teacher and the student; the remaining three are infrastructure elements—
the goals, content, and didactic processes of the curriculum. All elements of the model
are dynamic, subject to varying rates of change and adaptation. All of the elements of the
model function as an interconnected whole. They operate within a larger dynamic
professional and social context that includes economic and political environments, as

5.4.1 GenCyber Summer Camp Program29
The GenCyber program provides summer cybersecurity camp experiences for students and
teachers at the K-12 level. The goals of the program are to help all students understand correct
and safe on-line behavior, increase diversity and interest in cybersecurity and careers in the
cybersecurity workforce of the Nation, and improve teaching methods for delivering
cybersecurity content in K-12 computer science curricula.
Our vision is for the GenCyber program to be part of the solution to the Nation's shortfall of
skilled cybersecurity professionals. Ensuring that enough young people are inspired to direct
their talents in this area is critical to the future of our country’s national and economic security
as we become even more reliant on cyber-based technology in every aspect of our daily lives.
To ensure a level playing field, GenCyber camps are open to all student and teacher participants
at no cost. Funding is provided jointly by the National Security Agency and the National
Science Foundation. The GenCyber Program description presented to the Working group by the
Chief of the National Information Assurance Education and Training Program (NIETP) is
included in Appendix 6.30 It also includes descriptive information on the National Centers for
Academic Excellence Program that follows.
5.4.2 National Centers of Academic Excellence Program31
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and The National Security Agency (NSA) jointly
sponsor the National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) program, designating specific 2-
and 4-year colleges and universities as CAEs in Cyber Defense (CD). Schools are designated
based on their robust degree programs and close alignment to specific cybersecurity-
related knowledge units (KUs), validated by top subject matter experts in the field.
Nearly 200 top colleges and universities across 44 states, the District of Columbia, and the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are designated CAEs for cyber-related degree programs. CAE
graduates help protect national security information systems, commercial networks, and critical
information infrastructure in the private and public sectors.
Depending on Federal Government funding, next steps planned include studies to identify CAE
needs for hands-on education and measurement of student proficiency. The approach will be to
have one group looking at metrics and how to gather/report student proficiency relative to
education while the other group will look at how to create a virtual environment where
schools/students can engage in hands-on learning. The objective is to make that environment
universally accessible by the CAE schools initially and then to further expand availability if
possible. This study will provide a follow-on opportunity for the CSRIC to participate in the
development and enhancement of the CAE program in a manner consistent with the skills and
roles needed by the Communications Industry.

5.4.3 ACM Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education32
The ACM Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education (JTF) was launched in September 2015
with the purpose of developing comprehensive curricular guidance in cybersecurity education
that will support future program development and associated educational efforts.
The JTF is a collaboration between major international computing societies: Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM), IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS), Association for
Information Systems Special Interest Group on Security (AIS SIGSEC), and International
Federation for Information Processing Technical Committee on Information Security Education
(IFIP WG 11.8). The JTF grew out of the foundational efforts of the Cyber Education Project
(CEP). After a year of community engagement and development work, the ACM JTF launched a
survey in September 2016 to solicit broad input on the proposed curricular thought model. This
survey was published in October 2016 and is included in Appendix 13, ACM JTF Survey on
Cybersecurity Education. General feedback on the thought model provided additional insight for
the development process. Summary comments include:
• Clarify the intended audience of the curricular volume
• Clarify the definitions and distinguish between the elements
• Provide additional information on the content of each of the categories
• Simplify the model
• Provide a logical placement for emerging topics
The curricular volume, CSEC 2017, is estimated to be published in December 2017.
5.4.4 University of Washington Center for Information Assurance and
Cybersecurity (CIAC) Apprenticeship Program
Cyber operations is a rapidly evolving and expanding field. Failures in cyber operations present
industry with operational disruption, financial liabilities, diminishment of brand, and other
risks. The University of Washington (UW) Center for Information Assurance and Cybersecurity
(CIAC) has discussed industry’s needs for professional training and professional development in
cybersecurity and is preparing to launch an affiliation with an industry member from the
communications sector to improve training programs to meet the industry’s immediate needs.
Under this affiliation, the Information Security team from industry will work closely with CIAC
to define and pilot training programs and develop the underlying resources that will provide
near-term benefits to cybersecurity professionals and students entering this field. The hallmarks
of the new programs are:
• Multidisciplinary training. Cyber operations require a technical foundation, but
communication skills, risk management, and team participation are equally
important. Cyber operations rely on business operations, policies, and systems; and
beyond incident response it entails strategic planning, operational planning, effective
32 http://www.csec2017.org/

Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
communications, and robust auditing. Through this affiliation, students will learn about
the real business environment around cyber operations.
• Conforming to federal standards. There are federal standards helping to define the
professional field of cybersecurity. Like the field itself, these standards are evolving,
and a quality training program must address both industry needs and align with the
current federal standards and guidelines.
• Apprenticeship. Students will participate in an apprenticeship program that integrates
progressive industry experience with academic course work.
• Cyber lab. High quality simulations of operational environments help fill the gap
between academic training and real incident response. Level 1 of this lab provides
individual assessment on foundational knowledge, which will be used to assess skills for
job candidates. Level 2 (simulated environments) and Level 3 (competitions) will
provide valuable resources for ongoing professional development.
By establishing an affiliation which will extend into subsequent years by mutual agreement of
both parties, CIAC anticipates evolving the relationship over five or more years. The details
below address specific activity for the inaugural year.
5.4.4.1 Apprenticeship program
Students opt into an integrated program of instruction and industry internship that together lasts
for at least one year. Through the apprenticeship program, a student receives academic training,
certification, and industry experience to accelerate their impact as cybersecurity professionals.
The academic program will be offered through the Information Security & Risk Management
(ISRM) certificate program. This is a well-established and successful certificate program. The
course content will be updated to reflect the new NIST/NIICE knowledge-unit requirements.
The National Security Administration (NSA) through its National Information Assurance
Education and Training Program will partner in developing this apprenticeship model. The
following table provides an overview of the apprenticeship program for 2017:

DRAFT Final Report
For the industry internships, the students may be able to enroll for capstone credits in their
respective departments. The capstone course may include poster presentations as part of a final
project.
Students will be selected based on a balance of technical foundations, interpersonal skills, team
participation, and collaborative problem-solving. Each student will have a quarter in which to
fulfill prerequisites, and CIAC will help direct students to free online courses and resources for
this. The students will participate in the apprenticeship program as a cohort, to strengthen their
team skills and professional networks. The cohort will also serve as a peer group to enhance the
students’ learning and to provide support around personal, academic, or professional challenges.
As part of the evaluation, CIAC will consider recruiting in Spring/Summer 2017 for the 2017-
2018 school year and having the courses run Fall 2017 – Winter 2018 – Spring 2018. If CIAC
decides to move the calendar up in subsequent years, the industry on-site internships would run
January to June (this first year the internships will run from March to September).
5.4.4.2 Industry Affiliate contributions
For the initial launch of the CIAC Internship Program, UW has identified the following methods
and level of contributions from Industry Affiliate:
• 4 FTE (8 x 0.5 FTE) internships with progressive responsibilities, to run from mid-
March 2017 through mid-September 2017.
• Leadership participation in selection of students, oversight and review of the program
from Affiliate’s perspective.
• Team participation in supervising interns and in helping facilitate cohort meetings.
• Tuition for ISRM certificate program for 8 students.
5.4.4.3 CIAC governance
CIAC is developing educational programs for cybersecurity professionals, at the intersection of
academic culture, federal standards, and industry needs. To do this well, we need consistent
input and feedback from all three sectors, and this input and feedback is more valuable when the
representatives from the three sectors are in one collective conversation. In this way, challenges
can be addressed and solutions worked out that are responsive to the needs of everyone
involved.
The Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs at UW Bothell and the Executive Director of CIAC
will convene an advisory council to advise and comment on CIAC’s ongoing progress and
plans. The industry affiliate will be invited to participate on this advisory council.
5.4.5 Broadening Advanced Technological Education Connections (BATEC)33
BATEC is a National Center of Excellence for Computing and Information Technologies. It is
headquartered at the University of Massachusetts in Boston and sponsored by the National
Science Foundation ATE Program. Academic partners are leading edge community colleges in
33 www.batec.org
Page 31 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
the cities of Boston (Massachusetts), Chicago (Illinois), Springfield (Ohio), Las Vegas
(Nevada), San Francisco (California) and Fort Lauderdale (Florida). The mission of BATEC is
to increase both the capacity and the robustness of career-focused pathways in the fields of
Computer Science, Information Technology, Computer Networking and Data Analysis. Their
primary focus is public post-secondary education (community college and university) in the
fields of Computer Science, Information Technology, Computer Networking and Data Analysis.
They also work to address workforce development issues at the high school, community college,
and university levels through the design and development of programs that build awareness and
increase interest in computing and information technology fields of study.
5.4.5.1 Outreach programs34
BATEC offers many programs for outreach to achieve their goals. These include sponsoring the
placement of students in technical internships designed to be the first step in their career
pathway, offering introductory courses at community-based organizations for non-traditional
learners, and convening regional stakeholders to discuss common goals, identify resources,
document programs and share information on the subject of career pathways. The following
examples represent the portfolio of their recent offerings:
• The Technology Internship Program (TIP) is a comprehensive model for placing
community college technology students into semester (or summer) long internships with
small businesses. In our experience, small business internship demand has been
concentrated in web design/social media, help desk technician, and database support. All
of the applications, flyers, letters, and surveys, we created for implementing this program
are available by request.
• We work in partnership with city-sponsored initiatives to place high school students into
paid summer internships. These students are recruited and selected based on their interest
in pursuing a career in Information Technology. The Boston-based version of this
program works with over 50 companies and places over 130 students annually.
• The Summer Bridge program, an offering of credit courses and non-credit workshops,
was enhanced and scaled at Mass Bay Community College. High school students
(juniors and seniors) and incoming freshmen are afforded the opportunity to take one of
two credit bearing courses, or participate in a set of awareness building workshops that
are technology based.
• The Bridge to Community College program caters to nontraditional learners, embedding
community college classes in community-based organizations alongside tutoring and
social services. Introductory classes in a technical field combined with a general
education component act as a ladder to the community college.
• Workforce and economic development are some of the greatest challenges facing urban
cities. An emerging strategy for Career and Technical Education is to offer high school
students opportunities for transferable credit in introductory courses in Computer
Science and Information Technology. BATEC frequently acts as a subject-matter
34 www.batec.org/outreach/
Page 32 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
consultant for such endeavors, providing strategic direction, supplying expertise, and
curriculum.
• This program provides an opportunity for university level students to participate in high
technology start-up culture. It provides mentoring, workshops and a curriculum of
courses designed to prepare students for a career in the start-up economy. Piloted at the
University of Massachusetts, more than 120 students have been placed in over 40 of the
best start-up companies in the Boston area.
• Many cities have disparate programs targeting workforce development issues. ICT
Pathways is a model for bringing together stakeholders from high schools, community-
based organizations, community colleges, 4-year institutions, non-profit organizations
and local industry to work on a common goal. BATEC developed a network of
systematic resources to support retention, degree completion and career readiness for
students and job seekers in computing fields.
• Students engage in a viral video challenge to best convey their passion for technology
and the benefits of a career involving computers through short videos. “LoveTech” stars
community college students and faculty.
5.4.5.2 Cybersecurity Workforce Development Report
While not singularly focused on cybersecurity, BATEC released a report in January of 2016 in
partnership with Burning Glass that “analyzes the dimensions of the career pathway (number of
jobs, average compensation, and geographic distribution of jobs) and the requirements of the
employment opportunity (job responsibilities, technical and soft skill proficiencies” with the aim
of accelerating “…the development of dynamic, innovative academic programs and a pipeline of
workforce talent that support the industry needs for trained professionals.”
The top ten findings from the cybersecurity workforce report35 are presented below:
1. The field of cybersecurity is pervasive. Cyber-related skills are finding their way into
every job in Information Technology, Digital Networking, and Computer Programming.
2. The cybersecurity job landscape is large and growing, and offers strong employment
opportunities across the economy. There were 238,158 online job postings, in 2014, for
cybersecurity job postings in the United States. This represents a 91% increase in the
four year period 2010 to 2014.
3. Cybersecurity job postings remain open longer (8% longer than IT jobs overall)
suggesting that these jobs are harder to fill than IT jobs in general.
4. Cybersecurity jobs pay well. The average advertised salary for these jobs is almost
$84,000 – well above the average for all IT roles.
5. Cybersecurity jobs break into seven key broad categories (listed in order of employer
demand): Engineers, Managers, Analysts, Specialists, Architects, Auditors, and
Consultants.
6. The strongest growth in job postings is for the entry level roles of Specialist, Analyst and
Auditor. These positions work in operations and defend information resources on a day-
by-day basis.
35 CyberSecurity: Defending our Information Assets, January 2016
Page 33 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
7. Workforce opportunities in cybersecurity exist for job seekers of all educational levels.
Candidates, with appropriate skills but not a bachelor’s degree, can enter the workforce
in the Specialist category where 37% of the positions do not require a four-year degree.
A career in cybersecurity does, however, require a commitment to continued education
as the majority of positions require a Bachelor’s Degree and many high paying positions
require a Master’s Degree.
8. The career pathway in cybersecurity has reasonable definition. The job categories of
Specialist and Analyst provide entry level opportunities for candidates with modest
skills. The job category of Engineer provides economic incentive for continued
educational achievement and skill development. The job categories of Manager,
Architect and/or Consultant are the highest paying opportunities and require advanced
training, experience, and/or certification.
9. There is a career transition opportunity for returning veterans. Many corporate
cybersecurity roles require similar competencies to those required in the military, and
require security clearances which veterans either have in their possession or have
experience qualifying for.
10. The workforce challenge can be best addressed when employers, educators, and
policymakers work together in close collaboration. A shared vision and mutual
understanding of the requisite skills, academic credentials and industry certifications
required of a qualified candidate can empower educators to properly prepare an entry
level workforce.
The full report is included in Attachment 7 and presents a data driven analysis of the
employment opportunities across the cybersecurity workforce. It documents workforce needs
and includes a mapping of academic skills into a specific set of job roles and career pathways.
5.4.6 George Washington University CyberBlue Program Proposal
We currently face massive cybersecurity workforce shortages worldwide, lacking people who
think critically, recognize patterns, efficiently analyze data, discard preconceptions, and focus
deeply. Many autistic adults possess these exact cognitive abilities, but employers are aware of
only their social disabilities, creating a workforce mismatch that exacerbates security threats and
perpetuates disenfranchisement of persons with social disabilities. Over 70 million people
worldwide are living with autism and the dramatic upswell of autistic adults will exceed 3
million in the U.S. alone by 2020. At the George Washington University (GW), researchers are
proposing an innovative approach: “CyberBlue”36—a bold, scalable solution that uses one social
challenge to solve another. The GW-led initiative is a collaboration between the I3P37 and GW’s
Autism and Neurological Disorders Institute. GW’s team of experts aims to prepare a new
generation of autistic adults to be “cyber warriors” and launch new workforce initiatives to
strengthen systems, transform lives, and change global thinking about populations with
disabilities.

5.4.7 List of candidate best practices from Academic Findings
1. The Federal Government (DHS and NSA partnership) next iteration study will provide a
follow-on opportunity for the CSRIC to participate in the development and enhancement
of the Centers for Academic Excellence (CAE) program in a manner consistent with the
skills and roles needed by the Communications Industry. Proposed Best Practice is to
engage in the next iteration of the CAE public-private partnership workforce
development program that integrates educators and government to address the gap and
include the specific needs of the communications industry.
2. There is not only a lack of a skilled cyber security Workforce, but even worse there is a
lack of subject matter experts that are available to provide training. Proposed Best
Practice is to engage industry representatives to provide subject matter experts to the
Academic community to provide skilled resources for teaching courses or augmenting
instruction with lectures specific to industry needs and experience.
3. Successful programs have been developed to encourage early development of the skills
necessary in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) such as
GenCyber, the BATEC Summer Bridge program, cybersecurity competitions and
internship programs that engage K-12 students. These programs would benefit and
expand with active Communications Industry involvement and support.
5.5 Public Safety
For over 40 years, the 911 infrastructure was changed little from its initial deployment in the
1960s. During that time, communications capabilities, information processing and advances in
data sharing have revolutionized the way we interact, capture information and apply it to our
everyday lives. In order to revolutionize the capabilities of the modern PSAP, the emergency
services community including both public and private sector, developed an Internet Protocol
standards based architecture dubbed Next Generation 911 (NG-911). This new technology is
bringing about significant operational and technological changes. As next-generation
applications, services and infrastructure are deployed, PSAPs will have to make sense of voice,
video, text, and digital data that are converging on them simultaneously. From a 911 call-taker’s
point of view, PSAP managers need to think about how such information is going to be received
and processed, and what type of interfaces will be used for this task. There is an increasing need
to understand that in the future, the transition from a private community to a connected PSAP
will result in a dramatic increase in system vulnerabilities to cyberattack. Public Safety
organizations such as NENA and APCO are actively involved in reaching out to the emergency
services community to foster better understanding of these new and emerging threats and to
encourage the adoption of a program of education to become better prepared.38
The distributed (or local) nature of PSAPs and their corresponding workforce results in a unique
geographical challenge for development of skilled workforce to support cybersecurity operations
in support of the Public Safety mission. The diversity of implementation options for NG-911
under consideration (Multi-State, State, Regional, Local) call attention to the fact that
implementation and sustainment of cybersecurity for the local jurisdiction will be more costly
and difficult to execute. Reported numbers vary, but according to NENA as of August 2016, the

Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
United States has 5,893 primary and secondary PSAPs in 3,135 counties. This presents a very
specific Public Safety challenge when it comes to locally staffing PSAPs to address
cybersecurity needs. The distribution of academic institutions qualified to provide training in
cybersecurity for the widely distributed Public Safety telecommunicator workforce is not
adequate to address the local need. So, in addition to understanding the specific requirements for
Public Safety cyber security Workforce development, there is a need to deliver this training
broadly in a consistent manner and subject to the rigors of academic excellence needed to ensure
consistent performance across the entire workforce.
The first step in workforce planning, Define and Identify, emphasizes the collection of
workforce data that defines the workforce and the identification of positions/roles within the
workforce with specific role based competencies and proficiency levels. This activity in turn
establishes the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that are the attributes required to perform
a job and are generally demonstrated through qualifying experience, education, or training.
As a prescriptive example to Define and Identify Workforce, the working group members
reviewed job titles, roles and skills to assess NICE Framework labor categories, scope of work,
and information technology skills most closely associated with each. While PSAPs generally do
not have a single consistent model for job titles, a generalized set of job titles were mapped to
labor categories with identification of required skills and recommended training based on the
NICE Workforce Framework. The results compiled by Working Group 1 - Cybersecurity under
the FCC Task Force on Optimal PSAP Architecture program39 are presented in the Table below
as a baseline example of application of the Workforce Framework to Public Safety.

Page 40 of 645.5.1 Candidate Best Practice for Public Safety
Based on our analysis of the data provided and the unique challenges facing Public Safety both
in terms of the geographic reach required and the nature of the training needed, the WG7
members propose consideration of a distance learning initiative for delivery of the cybersecurity
curriculum that can initially support basic cybersecurity hygiene and eventually expand into a
broader course list addressing awareness and basic/entry level skills in cybersecurity for small
and rural PSAPs. By offering this program in partnership with local schools, universities and/or
community colleges, this could become a “lightening rod” for expanding basic literacy in
cybersecurity and potentially lead to expansion of skills required for higher paying jobs/careers
where the opportunity currently does not exist. This could help develop new workforce sourcing
opportunities in the rust belt or rural areas to cross the digital divide.
5.6 Financial Sector
This summary of findings from the Financial Sector is based on the Cybersecurity Workforce
Alliance (CWA), which co-chairs the NICE Framework Working Group for Private Sector
(WGPS),40 and informed by the iQ4 Workforce Supply-Chain platform aimed at improving the
workforce development process through automation in cybersecurity. The CWA was formed in
January 2015 with the support of SIFMA (Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association), which represents hundreds of securities firms, banks and asset managers.
Founding members in addition to SIFMA included iQ4 and 12 Wall St and Healthcare CISOs,
Federal Reserve Bank NY and The John Jay School for Criminal Justice at City University NY.
By word of mouth and reputation, there are now over 320 individual members, 120 employers,
over 120 current CWA Alumni graduates (with 108 in the Fall 2016 Semester). The CWA has
developed and matured a scalable education-to-industry engagement and accelerated supply
chain model, which has proven to be very successful by accelerating the training of the student
and professional cybersecurity/risk workforce by 6-9 months, making them productive and less
risk to the employer with an approximate 40:1 ROI.41
The CWA has been working with the CSRIC V WG7 and to date completed the NICE
Framework adoption stage of our alliance, adding 161 new KSAs to support the Communication
Sector specific needs identified in the Interim Deliverable from Working Group 7 produced in
March 2016. The next phase will leverage this work to define a Role Profile version, more in
line with industry adoption of the NCWF. The CWA and JPMChase co-chair the NICE WGPS,
and together with member companies from WG7, are working to identify critical roles and
competencies that members can leverage in supporting infrastructure and compliance
requirements. Role profiles will begin with skills, then tasks and objectives supported by a
maturity assessment model, analytics, and development planning tools. The US Navy, JPMC
and others have contributed to the mapping of the taxonomy to Job Roles and to Professional
certificates. This helps map the right people to roles and ensure that money is not wasted on
professional development/certificates when the candidate’s competency is assessed as not
having the pre-requisite skills for a given level for a course. As the taxonomy and model can be
used for next generation outreach and internally for Workforce Supply Chain, it follows that
Communication Industry participants can achieve the following benefits from the work of the
CWA by supporting continued improvement:

5. Ensuring a “good-fit” hire is made (as a bad hire costs 6x of that of a good hire); and
6. Cutting the time and cost it takes to hire, on-board and train new next generation hires.
Notably, as iQ4 is a co-chair of the NICE Workforce workgroup and is a representing member
of the CSRIC WG 7, they are currently serving to sustain and communicate the taxonomy
delivery to all users, after NICE has approved any updates.
5.6.1 CWA recommended best practices for implementing the framework into an
organization
Each organization should have a workforce roles champion with the contextual knowledge of
the sector and the ability to adapt the taxonomy to the roles required by the sector or employer.
Leveraging an automated tool to manage the roles and taxonomy databases can greatly simplify
the process. Tools, such as the iQ4 platform, provide automated matching engines to find direct
and “near-to” candidate fits; to stand up project teams quicker or to identify and upskill people
for a more economic internal transfer than hiring externally which positively impacts retention.

to universities and the internal use cases. CWA’s Alumni are landing great jobs in employers
(FBI, NY DA ‘s Office, PwC, Capgemini, Bank NY Mellon Federal Reserve, Harvard Research,
Virtusa Corp., International Securities Exchange) that have never sourced from their schools
before. CWA goes beyond the traditional sourced schools to enable employers to cast a wider
net and level the playing field to scale the supply of great next generation hires.
Active engagements that members have driven to enhance availability of a skilled cybersecurity
workforce are described in the following sections and include:
• City Uni NY: Summer 2015, Fall 2015, Spring 2016, Fall 2016
• u-Albany SUNY: Fall 2015, Spring 2016, Fall 2016
• FS Support: The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks locations have been offered as
locations for CWA semester final presentation to audiences of employers.
• Cyber 101: Entry Level Awareness training module released Fall 2016
These programs are described in additional detail in the paragraphs below.
5.6.1.1 City Uni NY: Summer 2015, Fall 2015, Spring 2016, Fall 2016
iQ4 formed the Cybersecurity Workforce Alliance to accelerate student workforce readiness.
Together with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) and the Vice
Chancellor of the City University of New York (CUNY), we launched an initiative to resolve
student readiness, by extending the workforce into the classroom. During the first 2 quarters, the
CWA identified the four cornerstones to make this work including; technology, standards based
lexicon, industry engagement model and a business case to continue sustainability. The program
based on the NICE taxonomy was used to create Role Based profiles and represent the most epic
challenges facing country and world today. iQ4 and JPM Chase co-chair the NICE Framework
for Private Sector with a focus on adopting the framework, and build industry driven
technology, content and models to create a scalable and sustainable model that supports the
CISRIC WG7 initiative.
A 6-week pilot with two teams of students (total 17) was run in July and August mentored by
CWA industry members. Students were from Law, Forensics, Business, Criminology and IT -
none had any previous experience in Cyber or any work experience. At the final presentation at
Bank NY Mellon, students were assessed by mentors as “being equal to someone in employment
for 12-months”; in terms of poise, confidence, understanding of the NIST framework and which
roles pull together to respond to insider and other threats.
As a best practice, the final presentations are at an employer site in front of mentors, employers,
academics and interested parties from State Education and Dept. Labor. The employer site helps
inspire the students within an employer’s workplace environment and develop them through the
experience in presenting/communication in the real-world workplace in front of a diverse
audience, including a sometimes tough grilling from a few of the mentors. After the sessions,
students go to tables organized by the job role that they have played during the course, where
they are interviewed and counselled by prospective employers.

DRAFT Final Report
John Jay is now expanding the CWA curriculum and model to offer the CWA applied learning
across campus (445,000 students) including 15,000 in IT. They applied for and received a grant
top “scaffold” the program upstream to associated Community Colleges and Schools to
influence STEM based learning using Cyber at the core.
The pilot has now been extended to a 10-14-week production credited curriculum to align with
academic teaching. Each semester sees an expansion of the program.
5.6.1.2 u-Albany SUNY: Fall 2015, Spring 2016, Fall 2016
University at Albany, SUNY, adopted the plug-and-play CW model and has been instrumental
in helping streamline the engagement process to reduce the time mentors need to apply to the
program. Dr. James Stellar, the President, is an enthusiastic supporter of applied learning. He is
extending the CWA program from the Business school to across faculty/campus, including the
new College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity (CEHC), which
was formed from funding by NY State Governor Cuomo.
CWA Fall 2016 includes over 80 students in 9 teams on “The Threat Within” being mentored in
3 classes for 1-hour per week. To increase efficient scaling, 80 students work in 9 teams are
being mentored in 3 classes by 9 senior industry experts. We recommend 3 mentors per class, as
they can share the workload, offer specific/different subject matter expertise and cover for one
another when their work takes priority.
U-Albany is taking a State University system lead by collaborating and expanding the program
across other Universities.
5.6.1.3 Financial Services Support
The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks locations have been offered as locations for CWA
semester final presentation to audiences of employers.
Senior IT Risk Examiners from the Federal Reserve Bank NY were part of the CWA founding
membership because they identified the potential of a near systemic collapse of the banking
system if certain organizations were compromised. FRBNY hosted the combined CUNY and
SUNY team finals in Fall 2015 and Spring 2016. Based on the successful outcomes, the support
has grown to include all 12 FRB locations has focal points for hosting and supporting the CWA.
This association will help provide credentials for the CWA to recruit FS firms of all sizes.
5.6.1.4 Cyber 101: Entry Level Awareness training module released Fall 2016
“Awareness” was a word raised by all founding members. It carries a number of meanings but,
in summary, all members want:
• All new employees to enter the workplace with some level of cybersecurity “awareness”
- from risks to good personal/employee practices to mitigate the risk. Thus avoid the
Page 44 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
impacts from lack of knowledge later.
• Students to be aware of their brands and the career offering they have in Cyber and GRC.
• Awareness that all industry sectors offer great, well paid, careers that are likely to last a
lifetime
This is an extremely helpful 3-week self-paced lead into the program as it sets out the challenge
landscape and the NIST framework to respond to it, as well as the roles that the students will
elect to role-play in their teams through the balance of the course they are taking.
5.6.1.5 101 variants
1. A high-level, scalable general awareness program is under development with results
being measured/recoded for trackable evidence of measured completion.
2. Based on the CUNY and SUNY experience focused on perfecting the CWA model, it
was clear that a deeper 101 program was important as a precursor to entering the CWA
Epic Challenges. This was designed by CWA mentor/members as part of “Project
Scale” where CWA member voluntarily helped design the expansion plan, map roles
from the NICE taxonomy and plan for IoT, Mobility, Autonomous Vehicles and “The
Soft War” Anti-terrorism modules.
5.6.2 Cross sector workforce development industry association
With other sectors adopting the CWA approach, the members of the Communications Industry
do not have to invest heavily to get the same benefits. Importantly, Communications Sector
industries can therefore progressively benefit from a standardized cross sector association of
CWA Alliances, all pulling in the same standards-based direction.
iQ4 has made its platform tooling and engagement model and the automated NICE taxonomy
available to the Communications Sector members. By adopting the plug and play model and the
taxonomy, with CSRIC extensions in Specialties and KSAs, the industry members can take
immediate advantage of a proven model and create a communications industry specific program
that supports the cross sector transportability of skills. As in the Financial Services sector
specific model (FS-CWA), a cohort of lead members from industry is required as volunteers to
review and update evolving taxonomy.
5.6.3 Keeping the Communications Industry up to date with CWA Activities
1. Frank Cicio of iQ4/CWA is co-opted on the CSRIC V WG7 and can assist in
establishing direct and open communications with CWA.
2. Industry members can join the CWA as an observer on the platform.
3. The CWA holds a monthly update conference call on the third Wednesday of each
month. All interested parties are invited. Contact frank@iQ4.com
4. NICE runs monthly sessions for the Workforce workgroup with monthly webinars and
update reports http://csrc.nist.gov/nice/nicewg/index.html

5.6.4 Use of an Automation Tool to keep up to date with NICE Taxonomy
The CWA was formed to support workforce development through industry led initiatives
including: NICE Framework adoption; epic challenge projects that extend the workplace into the
classroom; and industry virtual mentorship models. iQ4’s Workforce Supply Chain platform,
was built to address the missing automation needed to identify workforce risk, optimize
resources, develop and track talent, skill progression and performance. By leveraging the iQ4
platform, the CWA has automated the NICE taxonomy in ways that support the NIST-CA
Framework. iQ4 makes the NICE-based 4-tier taxonomy (Job Roles, Specialty Areas,
Competencies and KSAs - Knowledge, Skill and Abilities), available as controlled Open Source
to CWA members. The FCC is currently a CWA member.
5.6.5 List of candidate best practices from Financial Sector Findings
1. CWA records the outcomes and tracks the CWA Alumni progress into jobs. Their
Profile/Passports remain on the iQ4 Workforce Supply Chain Platform to be
found/matched by employers seeking candidates by role/taxonomy and they are invited
to the exclusive invitation only CWA Alumni Group on LinkedIn.
2. To increase efficient scaling, 80 students work in 9 teams are being mentored in 3 classes
by 9 senior industry experts. We recommend 3 mentors per class, as they can share the
workload, offer specific/different subject matter expertise and cover for one another
when their work takes priority.
3. The final presentations are at an employer site in front of mentors, employers, academics
and interested parties from State Education and Dept. Labor. The employer site helps
inspire the students within an employer’s workplace environment and develop them
through the experience in presenting/communication in the real-world workplace in front
of a diverse audience, including a “sometimes tough” grilling from a few of the mentors.
After the sessions, students go to tables organized by the job role that they have played
during the course, where they are interviewed and counselled by prospective employers.
5.7 Federal Sector
5.7.1 DoD Leads Migration from Certificate Based Training to KSA Focused
Metrics and the NCWF
DoD 8570 was published in 2005 to address concerns associated with having unqualified
personnel performing critical cyber security functions. The directive required personnel that had
access to information systems and performed specific security functions to receive and certify on
specific training to show competency in the job field. This raised the standard of the DoD and
industry as well as military and civilian components followed the standard.
In 2015 DoD 8140 was published to reissue and renumber 8570 and to update and expand
policies and responsibilities for managing DoD cyberspace workforce. As part of this updated
guidance, emphasis has been placed on the establishment and effective measure of cybersecurity
Page 46 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
training programs. Cyber security work role requirements must be integrated into training,
courses, and curriculum.
Work role (knowledge, skills, and abilities), baseline qualifications, and training requirements
derived in 8140 will emphasize job skills and experience over rote certifications. 8140 also
provides alignment to the NIST Cybersecuirty Framework as shown below in mapping of job
roles to the framework function areas.
Figure 7 – 8570 Mapping to NIST Cybersecurity Framework
In addressing this shift, vendors and those that are supplying training to the DoD need to adjust
the method and mechanism of the training provided to meet 8140 guidance. To address this
shift a few best practices were presented:
• Hands on training in realistic simulated environments
• Performance based assessment in simulated live fire environments
• Methods to measure true knowledge skills and abilities of the individual
• Proficiency verification – tools for measuring student (KSAs)
As part of the Working Group information gathering, Erik Wallace of Comtech
Telecommunications Corporation provided the presentation included in Appendix 8 to inform
the members on the DoD timeline and process for cybersecurity training to include the transition
from a certification driven process to the current KSA metrics driven standard.
5.7.2 Research Paper – “Closing the Federal Talent Gap”
There is a nationwide shortage of highly qualified cybersecurity experts, and the federal
government in particular has fallen behind in the race for this talent—individuals who are
Page 47 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
essential to protecting our nation’s critical public and private information technology
infrastructure. Federal agencies were having a difficult time recruiting, hiring, retaining and
properly training skilled workers in the cybersecurity field. The government did not even know
the size and competencies of the workforce let alone what would be needed in the future, and it
had no plan to address this problem.
During the past five years, the federal government has taken some positive steps, but the same
basic problems have grown more acute as the threat has multiplied. In short, the government still
lacks the cyber workforce it needs and still does not have a comprehensive, enterprise-wide
strategy to recruit and retain that workforce.
Federal agencies are left to fend for themselves in the hypercompetitive market for top cyber
talent. Some agencies—like the NSA and FBI—fare better than others, partly because of their
mission and partly because they have more personnel flexibilities than their sister agencies. That
agency-centric, “have versus have-not” approach has resulted in a federal cyber workforce that
in 2015 is uneven at best, especially when compared with top-tier private sector organizations.
Our interconnected world requires a seamless team of cyber defenders to protect our networks.
Those defenders must be able to operate quickly and collaboratively in ways that cut across both
private and public organizations. The cyber talent crisis has persisted long enough. Our Nation is
at risk as the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks continue to grow, but the government
has failed to act with urgency.
Many of the personnel issues confronting the cybersecurity workforce are endemic in the federal
system that makes recruiting and retaining the best and brightest talent in any career field a
formidable challenge.
It has been argued that the best way to deal with this government-wide challenge is to reform the
entire civil service system through market sensitive, performance-based pay that accounts for
occupational differences; a new, modern job classification system; expectations and rewards for
excellence; more flexibility to hire talented candidates and hold them accountable; and a new
enterprise-focused leadership structure that engages its employees, all without comprising the
core principles that have always anchored our civil service.
While such a government-wide overhaul may take time, cybersecurity is one area that simply
cannot wait. The current federal personnel system is more than 60 years old, created decades
before the Internet was a reality. With our national and economic security at stake, the cyber
workforce is an ideal place to launch a comprehensive strategy that will address current and
future cybersecurity workforce needs.
5.7.3 Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy
Federal departments and agencies face increasingly sophisticated and persistent cyber threats
that pose strategic, economic, and security challenges to our Nation. These cyber threats
demonstrate the need to employ the Federal civilian cybersecurity workforce with the necessary
knowledge, skills, and abilities to use those tools to enhance the security of the Federal digital
infrastructure and improve the ability to detect and respond to cyber incidents when they occur.
However, there simply is not a sufficient supply of cybersecurity talent to meet the increasing
Page 48 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
demand of the Federal Government. It is projected that this shortfall will expand rapidly over the
coming years unless companies and the Federal Government act to expand the cybersecurity
workforce to meet the increasing demand for talent.
The Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy42 details government-wide actions to identify,
expand, recruit, develop, retain, and sustain a capable and competent workforce in key
functional areas to address complex and ever-evolving cyber threats. The Strategy anticipates
that the Government will see the return on its investment through enhancements to Federal
cybersecurity and the improved knowledge, skills, and abilities incoming cybersecurity talent
bring to the Federal workforce.
5.7.4 DHS Workforce Development Tookit43
To develop a more resilient and capable cyber nation, we must have a highly-skilled
cybersecurity workforce across industry and government. The Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) is committed to helping organizations build a comprehensive cybersecurity
professional capability. DHS has created tools and resources, including the National
Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, to help organizations understand and act on their
cybersecurity workforce needs.
DHS’s workforce development tools and resources help organizations answer questions such as:
• What is the current state of my employee's cyber capabilities?
• What gaps do we need to fill?
• What kinds of cybersecurity workers do we need to hire?
• How can I keep and grow my cybersecurity staff?
Effective cybersecurity workforce development helps organizations more efficiently and
effectively recruit qualified cybersecurity professionals, and to provide this critical workforce
with clear job descriptions and development opportunities. DHS has a resource to help
organizations get – and keep – the right cybersecurity staff: The Cybersecurity Workforce
Development Toolkit. The Toolkit will help you understand your organization’s cybersecurity
workforce and staffing needs, and includes things like templates to create your own
cybersecurity career paths, and resources to recruit and retain top cybersecurity talent.
A copy of the DHS Cybersecurity Workforce Development Toolkit is included in Appendix 4.
5.7.5 OPM CyberCorps Scholarship for Service Program44
CyberCorps (R): Scholarship For Service (SFS) is a unique program designed to increase and
strengthen the cadre of federal information assurance professionals that protect the government's
critical information infrastructure. This program provides scholarships that may fully fund the
typical costs incurred by full-time students while attending a participating institution, including

tuition and education and related fees. Additionally, participants receive stipends of $22,500 for
undergraduate students and $34,000 for graduate students. The scholarships are funded through
grants awarded by the National Science Foundation.
5.7.6 List of candidate best practices from Federal Government Findings
Cyber security workforce includes both technical and non-technical professionals but it is the
responsibility of all agency leadership, employees, contractors, private industry, and American
people. The following are the Key findings addressing the insufficient supply of cybersecurity
talent.
Identify Cybersecurity Workforce Needs
Cybersecurity workforce needs can be addressed through the Cybersecurity Workforce
Framework and through the education of key Federal agency stakeholders, such as Human
Resources (HR) and Chief Information Officer (CIO) staff, about and the benefits of the
Workforce Framework and associated tools. The framework provides for the expansion of
cybersecurity position descriptions and the alignment with cybersecurity vacancies. Work with
the private sector to explore trends and anticipate future workforce needs can be performed as a
part of Strategic Workforce Planning.
Expand the Cybersecurity Workforce through Education and Training
Expanding the cybersecurity workforce through Education and Training will need long-term
investments in nationwide cybersecurity education that are crucial to establishing a sustainable
cybersecurity workforce. By identifying , compiling, and disseminating foundational
cybersecurity guidelines for academic institutions across the nation, collaboration with academic
institutions can identify new or promote existing foundational curriculum that address skill gaps.
The review of the current state of cybersecurity curriculum with academic institutions can
collaboratively align cybersecurity education with specific work roles and career paths. The
development of cybersecurity curriculum guidelines would provide minimum learning
requirements in specific areas in partnership with academic organizations.
Providing resources to academic institutions should accelerate and expand cybersecurity
education across the Nation by working with educational organizations to establish incentives
for cybersecurity experts to serve as faculty. Additionally, measuring the success of supported
educational programs that provide competencies, and knowledge, skills, and abilities associated
with each category and Specialty Area in the Workforce Framework provides to incentivize
academic institutions to expand and enhance their cybersecurity education programs.
Recruit and Hire Highly-Skilled Cybersecurity Talent
The Federal government struggles to attract and retain cybersecurity talent, Federal agencies
must engage in strategic recruitment and awareness campaigns, and pursue individuals with
cyber talent who, historically, may not have sought out government careers. This can be
accomplished through enhancing recruitment efforts with dedicated human capital personnel and
finding ways to streamline hiring and security clearance processes for cybersecurity personnel
consistent with governing law and applicable standards. This also includes pay and leave
flexibility, direct hire authority for information security professionals and a strategy aimed at
recruiting diverse talent from among veterans, existing civil service employees, apprenticeship
program graduates, and traditional sources. As well as providing opportunities for private sector
Page 50 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
employees to participate in rotational assignments at Federal agencies, enabling professionals
who may be reluctant to commit to a career in Federal service for short periods of time to share
their skills with Federal employees while gaining Federal service experience.
Retain and Develop Highly-Skilled Cybersecurity Talent
In order to retain cybersecurity talent, agencies must foster an environment that provides
rewarding and hands-on training experiences; supplies useful and appropriate technology;
empowers employees; creates a positive and supportive workplace culture; and acknowledges
that some of the cybersecurity employees the Federal Government hopes to attract may only
wish to stay for a short period of service. Such non-traditional opportunities for training and
skills refreshment must be considered in order to retain cybersecurity talent.
Enterprise-wide workforce planning includes efforts to incorporate certifications and training
opportunities so that cybersecurity professionals remain knowledgeable about emerging trends
in their area(s) of responsibility, with these and other professional development opportunities
serving as retention strategies. Helping agencies develop career paths that leverage existing
programs and responsibilities to deliver on best practices of performance management, talent
development, and compensation flexibility increases the focus on retention for top performers.
These planning efforts include the development of:
• Orientation programs for new cybersecurity professionals.
• Cybersecurity career paths, rotational assignments, and mentoring and coaching
programs, to provide employees with opportunities to become subject matter experts in
their field or move into managerial roles and take on increased responsibilities.
• Tailored cybersecurity training for employees, senior managers, and executives who
work in related career fields outside of cybersecurity
• Competitions, certifications, and credentialing to improve the skills of existing
employees that may qualify them for potential pay increases or promotions based on
demonstrated improvements in technical abilities.
• A common training program for specific categories of cybersecurity professionals.
The Government Lacks a Master Cyber Workforce Strategy to Attract and Retain Top
Cyber Talent:
• Develop a comprehensive cybersecurity workforce strategy
Undertake a comprehensive, enterprise-wide examination of the cybersecurity
o
workforce to better understand current capabilities and to develop a strategy to
meet future needs. This strategy should contain clear steps to attract and retain
cybersecurity talent, and include metrics for evaluating its success and shortfalls.
• Create a new occupational job series for cybersecurity employees
Establish a separate occupational series for the cyber workforce, or even a
o
framework for an occupational group. The Cybersecurity Workforce Framework
should serve as the basis for defining the new occupation.
Page 51 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
Skilled Cyber Workers Are in High Demand and the Federal Government Struggles to
Compete:
• Expand cybersecurity internships and scholarships
Internship programs in the cybersecurity arena could be used as a way to assess
o
potential talent, agency officials then could convert top talent to full-time
positions following completion of the internship. Congress should allow
agencies to use Scholarship for Service authority to offer high-performing
students scholarships directly in order to build a pipeline of talent that they want.
• Create a cybersecurity reserve corps for college students
To encourage more students to consider government service, we propose a
o
civilian Cyber Reserve Training Corps, similar to the military’s ROTC and
modeled after the intelligence community’s program.
• Make academic cybersecurity certification more rigorous
To increase the number of skilled cyber workers is to invest in the CAE program.
o
Government Loses Top Candidates to a Slow and Ineffective Hiring Process:
• Expand direct-hire authority
Expand direct-hire authority to cover all the jobs described in the Cybersecurity
o
Workforce Framework, where cyber work is a considerable percentage of the
individual’s time. If one job series for the positions is covered by the
Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, it could then grant direct-hire authority to
the full series.
• Put all cyber positions in the excepted service
This will make it easier to hire the talent needs for all agencies. The
o
administrative authority exists to place jobs in the excepted service when it
determines that it is administratively difficult to evaluate candidates by traditional
means.
• Validate cybersecurity competitions and scenario-based testing to identify and
assess talent
Use competitions and challenges to identify talented individuals relating to such
o
cyber skills as ethical hacking, penetration testing, vulnerability assessment,
continuity of system operations, security in design, cyber forensics and offensive
and defensive operations. Working with competition sponsors and other game
developers, as a basis to immediately begin designing, developing and validating
a prototype game-based assessment battery that is linked directly to the
Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, and that can effectively and efficiently
evaluate candidates’ proficiency for cybersecurity jobs.
• Allow agencies to share best qualified candidate lists
Creating cross-agency lists will reduce the number of times a qualified applicant
o
has to apply for and undergo assessment for similar jobs, and it will save agencies
time and money in their search for cybersecurity employees. This would be
Page 52 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
particularly feasible if OPM validates a common skills-based assessment. Create
a national best-qualified applicant pool for major occupations or specialties.
• Reform the security clearance process
Ensure that the investigations are rigorous while being done in a timely manner to
o
ensure the government can hire the cybersecurity talent it needs. Begin the
lengthy security clearance process as early as possible.
• Develop recruitment expectations of managers
Agencies can hold program managers accountable for this expectation through
o
their performance plans. Agencies’ human resource offices should be made
available to support these managers.
Agency Cyber Training and Development Is Uneven:
• Create a cybersecurity training academy focused on both technical and leadership
skills
An academy will help ensure that the government’s cybersecurity professionals
o
meet the most rigorous technical standards. It also would allow cyber talent to
build relationships with each other that could enhance protection of our networks.
An academy would also provide significant economies of scale.
• Create a cyber reserve for experienced talent
A Cybersecurity Reserve Corps could include graduates of the training academy
o
who agree to assist agencies with specific projects over time. Since we know that
many of government’s top talent leave federal service for the private sector, we
need to create opportunities to re-engage them as needed.
A Cybersecurity Reserve Corps could be an organization that captures the
o
intellectual rigor and standards of conduct of the medical and legal professions;
and the ethos of the Public Health Service and the military reserves, as well as
their agility, continuous learning and ability to provide assistance in times of
need. Borrowing from the emergency management field, establishing
opportunities for individuals to train together and work together will improve
their ability to work together and leverage each other’s areas of expertise when
needed.
Government Compensation Isn’t Competitive, Especially for Experienced Talent:
• Conduct a pay study
Commission a biannual total compensation comparison between federal and
o
private-sector cybersecurity jobs to more precisely measure differences in pay
and benefits that may impact recruiting, hiring and retention. The comparison
should be built off of the cyber professions that have been identified in the
Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.
• Track cyber attrition
Develop and administer a common web-based exit survey to track and understand
o
the reasons behind cybersecurity attrition. An exit survey would further our
Page 53 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
understanding of why top talent is leaving across the government so so it can be
learned how better to retain it. Track the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey
data by occupation, which could point to warning signs before talent leaves
government.
• Develop a market-sensitive pay system for the cyber workforce
Based upon the compensation comparison, immediately begin the design and
o
development of a special occupational pay system for jobs covered by the
Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. Implement pay reforms with respect to its
mission-critical cybersecurity occupations. Establish “special occupational pay
systems” that supersede the limitations of the General Schedule.
5.8 State Government Findings
Each and every state has a need to recruit, retain, and train a workforce capable of reducing the
cybersecurity risks for all state maintained cyber infrastructure that underpins all aspects of state
government and the state services provided to its residents. A strong cybersecurity workforce is
needed to protect the information and communication technologies used by state employees to
perform their daily jobs as well as to protect the state run critical infrastructure.
Information and communication technologies are being added and networked together in more
and more places meaning that all organizations like states who have responsibility to reduce risk,
in this case cybersecurity risk, are constantly challenged to maintain a workforce capable of
reducing cybersecurity risk in an increasingly complex environment. Our entire Nation is
coming to grip with the cybersecurity challenges presented by the adoption of cyber-physical
systems, the need to protect sensitive data, and the privacy and security challenges added by the
data being derived from Internet-Of-Things devices that are becoming more pervasive. States
are competing to recruit and retain their cybersecurity workforce. The challenges faced by states
are generally the same as those faced by Federal and private sector organizations with
cybersecurity workforces. Most states have four year (4Y) and two year (2Y) schools who are
preparing students and producing graduates capable of entering into state government service in
cybersecurity positions. The NSA/DHS Centers of Academic Excellence program has been in
existence since 1998. There NSA/DHS Centers of Academic Excellence offers the following
designations:
• CAE-IAE 4Y- National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance
Education
• CAE-CDE 4Y Cyber Defense Education
• CAE/IAE 2Y Information Assurance 2-Year Education
• CAE-CDE 2Y Cyber Defense 2-Year Education
• CAE-IA-R Information Assurance Research
Designated schools offer programs that reduce vulnerability in our national information
infrastructure by promoting higher education and research in IA/CD and producing a growing
number of professionals with IA/CD expertise in various disciplines. Designation is valid for
five academic years, after which the school must successfully reapply in order to retain its CAE
designation.
Page 54 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
• Students attending CAE IA/CD-E and CAE IA/CD-R schools are eligible to apply
for scholarships and grants through the Department of Defense Information
Assurance Scholarship Program and the Federal Cyber Service Scholarship for
Service Program. Designation as a Center does not carry a commitment for funding
from NSA or DHS.
• CAE IA/CD institutions receive formal recognition from the U.S. Government as
well as opportunities for prestige and publicity for their role in securing our Nation's
information systems.
• Alphabetical listing by state of designated schools
https://www.iad.gov/nietp/reports/current_cae_designated_institutions.cfm
There are NSF grants focused on helping more 2Y schools receive the designation, and there is a
CAE community https://www.caecommunity.org/ where one can connect with other schools
who have already received the designation for guidance on how to prepare a non-CAE school to
obtain the designation.
As awareness of the cybersecurity workforce challenges have grown, more Governors, state
legislature, CIOs, CISOs, Attorney Generals are stepping up to address state cybersecurity
workforce issues.
This summary does not try to duplicate one reference point that organizations can use to explore
state capabilities, the Special Edition of the Colloquium for Information System Security
Education (CISSE) A Study of State Cybersecurity Capabilities for Local and Regional

develop strategies for strengthening cybersecurity practices as they relate to state IT networks,
health care, education, safety, energy, transportation, critical infrastructure, economic
development and workforce. At present, the resources offer DHS resources that support the
NICE Workforce Framework.
The National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO) has identified
improving cybersecurity as a pressing public sector challenge. Human Resources/Talent
Management is item 8 in their top 10 final ranking of state CIO priorities for 201646. The
prioritized list is provided in Attachment 9. Additionally, NASCIO has a cybersecurity
committee and has a number of resources on its webpage47, including a map on which you can
click on any state and be taken to state page focused on cybersecurity. No direct workforce
initiatives are identified on the NASCIO site.
All 50 states are represented in the MULTI-STATE INFORMATION SHARING &
ANALYSIS CENTER (MS-ISAC)48. The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center
(MS-ISAC) is a voluntary and collaborative effort based on a strong partnership with the Office
of Cybersecurity and Communications within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
(DHS). The MS-ISAC has been designated by DHS as the key resource for cyber threat
prevention, protection, response and recovery for the nation’s state, local, territorial and tribal
(SLTT) governments. The MS-ISAC has built and nurtured a trusted environment of
collaboration and cooperation that is improving the cyber posture of SLTT governments. State
Principal members are generally CISOs from each state. While not specifically involved with
cyber workforce development, the MS-ISAC negotiates discounts on behalf of all SLTT
governments, saving as much as 85% off the commercial price, providing cost-effective access
to the training that governments need most.
Attachment 10 provides a state by state summary listing of highlights in workforce development
initiatives.
6 Recommendations
The CSRIC V Working group 7 was tasked to examine and develop recommendations for the
CSRIC’s consideration regarding any actions that the FCC should take to improve the security
of the nation’s critical communications infrastructure through actions to enhance the
transparency, skill validation, and best practices relating to recruitment, training, retention, and
job mobility of personnel within the cybersecurity field. We evaluated many different segment
approaches to specific aspects of the challenges we face as an industry. The information
gathered and analysis conducted lead us to focus on recommendations that would positively
impact the global challenge that we face across both the private and public cybersecurity
workforce. Workforce Development is not about filling job openings, although that is a source
of metrics often used to represent the scale of the challenge. Instead, we chose to base our

Page 56 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
approach on the simple adage – a rising tide raises all boats. This led us to focus on the
following broad based recommendations that would expand the available pipeline of skilled
candidates for our industry as a whole.
6.1 The FCC Should Support a Process for the Communications
Industry to Cooperatively Support Updates to the NICE
Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF)
The NCWF builds upon decades of industry research into how to effectively manage the risks to
valuable organizational electronic and physical information. Through the years, the industry that
has been referred to as computer security, information security, and now cybersecurity has been
supported by dedicated workers supporting an evolving set of Work Roles, Tasks, and KSAs.
Cybersecurity tactics are ever-changing, always identifying new ways to gain information
advantage through technology. As organizations evolve the ways they perform cybersecurity
functions, so must the components of the NCWF continue to evolve. During the time period
while the Working Group was evaluating the fit of the NCWF as a reference resource for
Communication Sector specific requirements, DHS and NIST released an update in the form of
Draft NIST SP 800-181, the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. The data elements of
the NCWF version 2.0 from 2014 were reviewed and developed as a deliverable for this initial
phase of the Working Group 7 tasking. WG7, in a cooperative engagement with CWA,
submitted inputs through the NICE Working Group to the updated NCWF to include review of
roles and identification of common KSAs across industries that serve as the core for
development of curricular guidance. Ongoing Industry participation in the process of supporting
periodic review and update through a continuous cycle is a recommendation resulting from these
efforts. By continuing to identify and evolve the NCWF training requirements, this data is less
likely to get stale or become inapplicable to the dynamic needs of the Communication Segment.
The Working Group recommends to the CSRIC V that it should guide the FCC to encourage
Industry participation in the CWA to facilitate the sustainment of this dataset.
The plug-and-play nature of the CWA model enables a local, national and international role out
of the industry, which has already proven to deliver the requisite workforce readiness skills on a
massive scale. The CWA has opened operations in the United Kingdom and due to demand is
planning on opening in Europe, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, India and Hong Kong (and wherever
there is a viable cohort of education and industry stakeholders). The Communications Industry
sector members can join the CWA ‘boat’ to take immediate advantage of internationalization on
a rising tide. Thus, minimizing cost/effort while maximizing contribution, standardization and
benefits.
While the CWA was founded in the Financial Markets, the taxonomy is open source (on
spreadsheets) and is transportable across the private sectors. FCC can be both a collaborator and
a beneficiary. As a collaborator, the CSRIC V Working Group 7 has contributed 162 additional
rows to the NICE cybersecurity taxonomy and as a beneficiary now has access to1,230
taxonomy rows including essential workplace roles and professions. Common KSAs found in
all job roles can now be aligned with Knowledge Units taught by education, thus improving
education curriculum to industry requirement alignment. It is anticipated that the Utilities
Technology Council will also be adopting the CWA led taxonomy and NIST framework to
adopt the standard and not go-it-alone. All development outcomes get fed back to NICE for
validation and recycling and new NCWF releases. On behalf of the CWA, iQ4 has automated
Page 57 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
the NICE taxonomy, avoiding the burden of management by spreadsheets and initiated a project
to apply the Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) to all job families across the IT/Digital
disciplines. A CWA workgroup will then expand and validate the content which can then be
automated as well.
The CWA has developed a model where, via virtual-menternships™, the workplace is delivered
into the classroom for team-based, role-based, time-bound real world experiential learning
challenges where students are mentored by industry Cyber/Risk experts.
• The on-line curriculum is designed to develop workforce skills and readiness in entry-level
enables cyber/risk candidates to cut 3-months or more out of the time taken to on-board them
and spin up to productivity.
• The model enables employer to cast a wider net (locally, nationally and internationally) and
level the playing field to find hidden talent and meet diversity and veteran employment
opportunity goals.
• Universities engaged as CWA members are commencing to “scaffold” in Colleges and High
Schools (down to K9 in one case) to the CWA course they run for undergraduates.
6.2 Communications Industry can Benefit by Growing Awareness of
and Supporting Programs Encouraging K-12 Youth to Study
Cybersecurity
Successful programs have been developed to encourage early development of the skills
necessary in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) such as GenCyber, the
BATEC Summer Bridge program and other internship programs that engage K-12 students.
These programs would benefit and expand with active Communications Industry involvement
and support. General areas of support to include Seminars, presentations at schools, after school
workshops and even summer programs like cyber camps can all be used to spread awareness of
cybersecurity and encourage the next generation to both practice good cyber hygiene and
potentially consider a career in cybersecurity.
Industry members should also consider the value of participating in or supporting cybersecurity
competitions as a means to raise awareness about cybersecurity and to develop skills in students
who may become part of our workforce. The Competitions subgroup of the National Institute for
Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Working Group recognized a need for a deeper look into the
role that cybersecurity games play in developing tomorrow's workforce. A commissioned study
resulted in the report, “Cybersecurity Games: Building Tomorrow’s Workforce” which is
included as Appendix 14 to this report and quoted below:
“Competitions provide a valuable learning opportunity for participants, regardless of
skill level. ‘Cyber as a sport’ is a growing trend in high schools; the number of high
school teams that participated in the Air Force Association’s CyberPatriot doubled in a
two-year period from over 2,200 in 2014 to over 4,000 in 2016.9 Educators increasingly
recognize cyber competitions demonstrate and develop planning, leadership,
collaboration and communication skills and offer a compelling alternative for students of
all ages who are less likely to compete or excel at physical sports.
Finally, the safety, security and enjoyment aspects of competitions should not be
Page 58 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
overlooked. When practicing both offensive and defensive maneuvers in a typical
competition environment, players are encouraged to practice and hone cybersecurity
skills in a controlled, real-world environment where no harm can come to the
competitors. Moreover, cyber competitions are enjoyed as a forum for networking, team
building, and information sharing.”49
The Working Group membership further recognize the value of competitions that extend beyond
the K-12 student population to Colleges and even industry professionals as a method to increase
awareness of the opportunities in cybersecurity across a broader population.
6.3 The FCC Should Encourage Communications Industry
Development of Cooperative Work-Study Program Partnerships
Internship programs in the cybersecurity arena could be used as a way to assess potential talent,
agency officials then could convert top talent to full-time positions following completion of the
internship. Successful programs:
• Develop engaging internship roles with clearly defined expectations and deliverables that
provide value to the company and the individual
• Ensure the intern has the opportunity to explore several cybersecurity functions within IIS, in
addition to their internship role
• Enable the intern to appreciate the depth and breadth of the cybersecurity program
• Assist with recruiting for future interns and permanent roles
In addition to Internships, the use of Apprenticeships is a provide solution for recruiting,
training, and retaining world-class talent. Programs like ApprenticeshipUSA offer the
Communications Industry access tools that can be leveraged to establish, monitor, and grow a
successful ApprenticeShip program.50 Accordingly, WG7 recommends that Communications
Industry members consider participating in existing partnerships or establishing their own work-
study programs as a best practice to develop and hone cybersecurity skills in new or existing
staff specifically focused on the unique needs to the members of the Communications Industry
segment.
6.4 The FCC should engage with the Communications Industry to
Develop or Expand Scholarship for Service Programs in Industry
Industry should consider scholarship for service programs in which students are given
scholarships while in school that obligate the student to work for a certain period of service for a
private employer. The United States government CyberCorps®: Scholarship for Service (SFS)51
is a unique program designed to increase and strengthen the cadre of information assurance
professionals working in federal, state, local, and tribal entities protecting the government's
critical information infrastructure. This program provides scholarships that may fully fund the
typical costs incurred by full-time students while attending a participating institution, including
tuition and education and related fees. Additionally, participants receive stipends of $22,500 for
undergraduate students and $34,000 for graduate students. The scholarships are funded through
National Science Foundation grants awarded to a higher education faculty member who recruits

DRAFT Final Report
the students into the program. Recently, two year schools have been added to the program such
that students apply at two year schools apply for the SFS scholarship that will include
completion of a degree at a four year school.
6.5 The FCC Should Encourage Communications Industry
Cybersecurity Professionals to Help Train the Next Generation
The Academic Segment has identified a severe shortage of qualified instructors. As a result of
this shortage, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Academic Segment to address the
growing demands for training in cyber security practices. CSRIC WG7 believes that the
Communications Industry is well positioned to assist the Academic Segment by encouraging our
current professional staff with skills in cyber security to pursue adjunct faculty positions,
participate as guest speakers or even host seminars/webinars that will help to bring an industry
specific view of opportunities in the Communications Industry for cybersecurity specialist. By
helping to address the specific gap with qualified staff from the Communications Industry, the
Working Group believes that this will both increase the number of candidates that can receive
training and also influence the content to be more specific to the needs of the Communications
Industry.
6.6 The FCC Should Encourage the Communications Industry to
Participate in the Development of Curriculum Guidelines by the
Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education
The ACM Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education (JTF) was launched in September 2015
with the purpose of developing comprehensive curricular guidance in cybersecurity education
that will support future program development and associated educational efforts. The JTF is a
collaboration between major international computing societies: Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM), IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS), Association for Information Systems
Special Interest Group on Security (AIS SIGSEC), and International Federation for Information
Processing Technical Committee on Information Security Education (IFIP WG 11.8). The JTF
grew out of the foundational efforts of the Cyber Education Project (CEP).
The Communications Industry should be prepared to provide comments as the JTF surveys
industry and publishes material for comments. Additionally, in late 2016, NSA’s College of
Cyber solicited proposals from educational institutions who wish to educate and prepare
cybersecurity graduates to fill Federal government cybersecurity positions. The communications
industry should track which educational institutions receive funding and collaborate with those
institutions when opportunities arise.
6.7 FCC Should Partner with Communications Industry, Public
Safety, and Federal GenCyber to Develop a Cybersecurity
Distance Learning Program for Public Safety and Rural
Communities
Based on our analysis of the data provided and the unique challenges facing Public Safety both
in terms of the geographic reach required and the nature of the training needed, the WG7
members propose consideration of a distance learning initiative for delivery of the cybersecurity
curriculum that can initially support basic cybersecurity hygiene and eventually expand into a
broader course list addressing awareness and basic/entry level skills in cybersecurity for small
Page 60 of 64Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council
Working Group 7 – Cybersecurity Workforce Development
DRAFT Final Report
and rural PSAPs. By offering this program in partnership with local schools, universities and/or
community colleges, this could become a “lightening rod” for expanding basic literacy in
cybersecurity and potentially lead to expansion of skills required for higher paying jobs/careers
where the opportunity currently does not exist. This could help develop new workforce sourcing
opportunities in the rust belt or rural areas to cross the digital divide.
6.8 The Communications Industry Should Support Innovative
Cybersecurity Workforce Development Initiatives such as the
CyberBlue Program Support to Engage Populations with
Disabilities
We currently face massive cybersecurity workforce shortages worldwide, lacking people who
think critically, recognize patterns, efficiently analyze data, discard preconceptions, and focus
deeply. Many autistic adults possess these exact cognitive abilities, but employers are aware of
only their social disabilities, creating a workforce mismatch that exacerbates security threats and
perpetuates disenfranchisement of persons with social disabilities. Over 70 million people
worldwide are living with autism and the dramatic upswell of autistic adults will exceed 3
million in the U.S. alone by 2020. At the George Washington University (GW), researchers are
proposing an innovative approach: “CyberBlue”52—a bold, scalable solution that uses one social
challenge to solve another. The GW-led initiative is a collaboration between the I3P53 and GW’s
Autism and Neurological Disorders Institute. GW’s team of experts aims to prepare a new
generation of autistic adults to be “cyber warriors” and launch new workforce initiatives to
strengthen systems, transform lives, and change global thinking about populations with
disabilities.
6.9 Communications Industry Cybersecurity Experts Should Join the
National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Working
Group or One of its Subgroups
The NICE Working Group (NICEWG) has been established to provide a mechanism in which
public and private sector participants can develop concepts, design strategies, and pursue actions
that advance cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development. Subgroups have
been established to focus in areas that are reflected in the earlier recommendations of this report.
Below is a table that describes the NICE Working Group and the five subgroups. Each
subgroup and the overall working group meet once a month via conference call/webinars. The
subgroup members agree to voluntarily work on initiatives or the sharing of best practices that
further progress towards the NICE Strategic Goals and Objectives.54

7 Conclusions
This final report demonstrates the applicability of the National Cybersecurity Workforce
Framework to the Communication Sector specific cybersecurity skills requirements. The dataset
provided as an Appendix to this Final Report was also provided to the FCC as an electronic file
(Excel Spreadsheet) that can be released at the discretion of the FCC without restriction.
In developing our final report, Working Group 7 collaborated across academia, industry and
government to develop recommendations and identify best practices that can be leveraged to
enhance cybersecurity workforce planning. We also identified applications, templates, and other
tools that are available to the Communications Sector to continue to promote existing and future
cybersecurity workforce development activities. This final report includes specific
recommended actions that are available to our industry to expand and fill the cybersecurity
workforce pipeline.
As an industry, we are still in the early days of addressing the development of a skilled
cybersecurity workforce that can meet our needs. Future activities may include:
• Extending and integrating activities across the Communications Sector to raise
cybersecurity awareness;
• Identifying and supporting foundational research opportunities in areas including
cybersecurity awareness, training, and education, and security usability;
• Continuing to improve our understanding of sector specific cybersecurity workforce
needs; and
• Issuing guidelines, tools, and other resources to develop, customize and deliver
cybersecurity awareness, training, and education materials.
