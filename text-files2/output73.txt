1 Results in Brief
1.1 Emergency Alert System
The Emergency Alert System is the primary warning system that provides the President with the means to
address the nation during a national crisis. Over the years it has gone through several transformations but
until recently can best be described as an analog delivery system. On May 31, 2007, the FCC adopted a
Second Report & Order (R & O) to strengthen the development of next generation technology for the
Emergency Alert System (EAS)1. This R&O requires EAS participants to accept messages using
Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) digital delivery.
Subsequently, on November 18, 2010 the FCC adopted the Fourth Report & Order to establish the
deadline for EAS participants to start receiving CAP messages no later than June 30, 20122.
On January 10, 2012 the FCC released the Fifth Report and Order which further clarified the process to
receive and transmit CAP messages for the EAS and to streamline the Part 11 rules3. CSRIC Working
Group 9 was established to provide recommendations and best practice for the deployment of CAP and
to provide an overall progress report on the first months of CAP implementation.
1.2 Executive Summary
As the Emergency Alert System (EAS) community adds an additional layer – supplementing the legacy
broadcast based alerting relay platform with Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)-based platforms, there is a
need for common deployment plans and best practices to help assist with the transition. The Working
Group researched a number of architectural issue areas, and formulated several recommendations to
CSRIC for EAS participants intended to facilitate their CAP migration processes. More importantly, the
Working Group has identified a significant number of issues that we feel require additional examination.
1. The working group has a general consensus that the government should undertake testing and
if necessary further development of a CAP Emergency Action Notification EAN streaming audio
message capability.
2. The WG strongly advises that the existing EAS audio (radio) relay based on the Primary Entry
Point (PEP) system should remain in place as a required parallel system, and continue to
operate in order to provide a reliable, redundant pathway for Federal-level emergency
messaging through broadcast media, in the event of a national emergency.
3. The working group recommends that the FCC coordinate with the Integrated Public Alert and
Warning System, IPAWS, to ensure that proper Conformity Assessment support is provided, in
the event that a manufacturer requires a test or re-test of a product.
4. The working group recommends that compliance with both a future streaming requirement, as
well as the current IPAWS atom interface should be required for all CAP EAS devices.

2 Introduction
CSRIC was established as a federal advisory committee designed to provide recommendations to the
Commission regarding best practices and actions the Commission may take to ensure:
• Optimal operability
• Security
• Reliability
• Resiliency of communications systems
Including:
Telecommunications
o
Media
o
Public safety communications systems
o
Due to the large scope of the CSRIC mandate, the committee then divided into a set of Working Groups, each of
which was designed to address individual issue areas. In total, 11 different Working Groups were created,
including Working Group 9 on EAS CAP Implementation.
Working Group 9 officially started its work in December 2011 and was given until March 2012 to produce this First
Report. The focus for Working Group 9 is to:
• Review the Fifth R&O (released January 10, 2012) on CAP deployment
• Provide FCC recommendations for best practices to facilitate CAP implementation on national, state and
local levels
• Identify technological challenges.
The second report, presented in June 2012, reviewed audio format and authentication. In September 2012 the
group reported on case studies from state and local implementation as well as best practices for message
origination. Finally in March 2013 the working group will submit the final report on implementation.

3 Objective Scope and Methodology
3.1 Objective
In its January 2012 EAS Fifth Report and Order (EB Docket No. 04-296), the Commission sought to
continue the process to transform the Emergency Alert System (EAS) into a more technologically
advanced alerting system by revising Part 11 Emergency Alert System (rules) to specify the manner in
which EAS Participants must be able to receive alert messages formatted in the Common Alerting
Protocol (CAP) and streamlining Part 11 rules to enhance their effectiveness and provide clarity.
The Fifth Report and Order is the second of two orders that implement Part 11 rule changes stemming
from the Third Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (FNPRM). The previous order, Fourth Report and
Order, addresses the single issue of establishing a new deadline of June 30, 2012 for meeting the various
CAP-related requirements that the Fifth R&O codifies. The Working Group was asked to review the new
order to provide insight, implementation recommendations and status. In this Fifth R&O Report, the
Working Group shall also recommend actions the FCC could take to improve EAS as it incorporates the
new CAP protocol.
3.2 Scope
Per the Working Group 9 charter, the group found it essential to begin with an initial focus on the FCC
Part 11 Rules governing the EAS as it involves best practices to facilitate CAP implementation leading up
to and beyond the June 30, 2012 deadline. The committee will be working with real-time data and events
as they unfold during the roll out. Based on results of these events the group will gain valuable insight
and metrics that will be used for future planning and rulemaking.
3.3 Methodology
The Working Group 9 uses a collaborative, inclusive approach to its work. Given the array of expertise,
the WG-9 members brought to bear on this effort, it is critical to provide a multitude of forums and
mediums through which participants could express their opinions and help shape this Final Report. The
following section details the methodology through which WG-9 achieved this objective.
3.3.1 Sub-Group Structure
After its initial set of meetings, the Chair and Co-Chair of Working Group 9 decided to review the
structure of the Working Group and develop a plan that would allow for WG-9 to proceed with its
study in an organized fashion which leveraged the diverse backgrounds of the Group’s
membership.
As such, WG-9 broke into two Sub-Groups; WG-9-1 is focusing on National implementation and
best practices of CAP, WG 9-2 focusing on the progress of CAP implementation and best
practices at the state and local level. The two Sub-Groups have moved forward with independent
conference calls that focused almost exclusively on the portions of the CAP implementation most
applicable to their expertise.
Each Sub-Group had a Lead who developed an agenda and framed conversation and discussion
amongst the participants. On some of the more divisive issues, the Lead worked to bring
members closer to consensus and encouraged open dialogue designed to find common ground.
Page 7 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
3.3.2 Collaboration via Portal
In addition to the regular conference calls, an online collaboration portal was designed and
implemented for use by the WG-9 participants. The portal is accessible to all Working Group
members throughout the duration of their work on behalf of the CSRIC. Table 2 details some of
the most prominent capabilities featured on the Portal and how they were used by the members
of the Working Group 9.
Portal Capability Description of Use
Document Repository Collaboration space where members posted, reviewed, and edited
documents
Forum Open space where issues were discussed amongst members
Calendar Central location where all relevant meetings and events were
documented
Table 2
From its inception, the portal became a useful tool for the Working Group as they shared ideas,
resources, and collaborated on common documents, including this Final Report. Given the
disparate locations from which the WG-9 members originated, having an online collaboration tool
was instrumental to the successful completion of the Working Group’s final product.

4 Background
From the onset of WG-9’s work, close attention was paid to researching relevant topics, including the EAS, the
Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), the CAP, and the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS)
and other alerting methodologies. Several members of the 9 Working Group brought specialized expertise in one
or more of these areas and is also members of WG-2 that is focused on future developments in EAS systems.
4.1 Emergency Alert System (EAS)
EAS is the primary national warning system that provides the President with the means to address the
nation during a national crisis. State and local officials also use EAS to originate warning messages
about imminent or ongoing hazards in specific regions. Several Federal agencies share responsibility for
EAS at the national level:
• FCC
• FEMA
• National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS)
Functionally, EAS is a hierarchical alert message distribution system. Initiating an EAS message,
whether at the national, state, or local level, requires the message originator (e.g. FEMA, which initiates
EAS alerts at the national level on behalf of the President) to deliver specially-encoded messages to a
broadcast station-based transmission network that, in turn, delivers the messages to individual
broadcasters, cable operators, and other EAS Participants.
EAS Participants maintain special encoding and decoding equipment that can receive the message for
retransmission to other EAS Participants and to end users (broadcast listeners, cable and other service
subscribers).
4.1.1 Second Report and Order - Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
On May 31, 2007 the FCC adopted a Second Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (EB Docket 04-296, FCC-07-109A1) (Erratum, DA-07-4002A1) to strengthen the
EAS and to promote the development of fully digital next generation technologies and delivery
systems for EAS. The Second Report and Order requires EAS participants to accept messages
formatted using CAP, the groundwork for next generation EAS delivery systems, no later than
180 days after FEMA announces its adoption of standards in each case. CAP is intended to
ensure the efficient and rapid transmission of EAS alerts to the public in a variety of formats (e.g.
text, audio and video) and via different channels (e.g. broadcast, cable, satellite, and other
networks).
4.1.2 Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
On May 25, 2011, the FCC adopted the Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in which
they sought comment on a wide range of tentative conclusions and proposed revisions to the Part
11 rules that would more fully delineate and integrate into the Part 11 rules the CAP-related
mandates adopted in the Second Report and Order. The Commission received 30 comments and
12 reply comments in response to the Third FNPRM.
Page 9 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
4.1.3 Fourth Report and Order
Subsequently, on November 18, 2010, the FCC adopted the Fourth Report and Order in this
docket, in which they amended section §11.56 of the EAS rules to require EAS Participants to be
able to receive CAP formatted EAS alerts no later than June 30, 2012.
4.1.4 Fifth Report and Order
Finally, in the January 2012 FCC Fifth Report and Order on EAS (EB Docket No. 04-296), the
Commission sought to continue the process to transform the Emergency Alert System (EAS) into
a more technologically advanced alerting system by revising Part 11 Emergency Alert System
(rules) to specify the manner in which EAS Participants must be able to receive alert messages
formatted in the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) and to streamline Part 11 rules to enhance
their effectiveness and to provide clarity.

5.2 Findings CAP EAS Network Architectures and Platforms
As the Emergency Alert System (EAS) community adds an additional layer – supplementing the legacy
broadcast based alerting relay platform with Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)-based platforms, there is a
need for common deployment plans and best practices to help assist with the transition. The Working
Group researched a number of architectural issue areas and formulated several recommendations to
CSRIC for EAS participants intended to facilitate their CAP migration processes. Importantly, the
Working Group has identified a significant number of issues that we feel require additional examination.
Therefore, the following information is principally intended to act as a guidepost to areas that require mor
e in-depth study and policy discussion. It is important to stress that the following discussion is applicable
to any IP-based CAP system. The Working Group is not associating our findings and recommendations
with any single CAP system, whether Federal, state or local. The Working Group is, however, identifying
a range of question areas that bear additional examination and scrutiny for any such public safety capabili
ty.
During this discovery exercise it became apparent that while general Best Practices and Network Standar
ds exist in industry to provide guidance in the design, implementation and maintenance of any network th
at may be considered necessary to facilitate the carriage of CAP alert messages, it was unclear which be
st practices were adopted by CAP networks.
What also became evident was the lack of characterization of the CAP network operational requirements
that are needed to assign, associate or designate the appropriate Best Practices and/or Standards. Base
d on these basic conclusions, the following information is intended to note where additional studies are ne
eded in order to fully understand what Best Practices and Standards are need to ensure an overall reliabl
e network. The Key assumption that drives the following discussion is the “network is only as strong as its
weakest link”.
The Working Group’s examination of CAP Architectures focused primarily on known means of web-based
dissemination of CAP alerts for EAS activation. This focus was mainly driven by our understanding of the
reliance of both the FEMA IPAWS system and a growing number of states, local and territorial CAP syste
ms on web-based CAP dissemination. The Working Group is aware that various forms of satellite-based
CAP dissemination are in use in a significant number of alert systems, principally at the state level. We d
efer examination of satellite-based architectures for a future report.
Below, the next page shows both Federal (IPAWS) and state/local web-based CAP architectures. These
are representations are intended to be archetypical, and not necessarily representative of any single
extant CAP system.
Page 13 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
Page 14 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
5.2.1 Overall Network
Reliability – The Working Group initially examined the question of what reliability requirements
are being placed on this network, if any. For example is it to be considered a fully redundant and
hardened network, are “five nines” reliability requirements necessary, or reasonable? The
following table illustrates the requirements for each possible requirement.
Availability % Designation Downtime per year Downtime per month* Downtime per week
90.% one nine 36.5 days 72 hours 16.8 hours
99.% two nines 3.65 days 7.20 hours 1.68 hours
99.9% three nines 8.76 hours 43.8 minutes 10.1 minutes
99.99% four nines 52.56 minutes 4.32 minutes 1.01 minutes
99.999% five nines 5.26 minutes 25.9 seconds 6.05 seconds
i. The choice of the above requirement will drive almost all of the basic design
requirements through-out the entire network.
ii. The above requirement with also directly affect the cost of the overall
network.
iii. It should be remembered that “all” elements of the network (end-to-end)
must meet these requirements of the overall reliability will be impacted.
iv. Our initial suggestion is that achieving five nines of reliability and still using
the Internet as the primary transport source will have not a significant impact
on the overall network reliability.
v. At the same time, the actual delivery of information across the Internet
cannot be regarded a high reliability or mission critical network. The
Internet’s current architecture uses a ‘best efforts’ delivery paradigm rather
than a guaranteed end-to-end level of service. This factor was most often
cited by critical infrastructure organizations as being the most significant
reason why the Internet could not be relied upon for ‘lifeline’ applications.
5.2.2 Future of Internet Risks
Internet reliability risks are constantly evolving. Many fluctuations in the likelihood and
consequence of various threats are expected to occur in the next ten years.
A table of expected movements in likely risks (Like Trend) and consequences (Con. Trend) is
shown on the next page. (Green down=getting better, Red up=getting worse)

5.2.3 Reasons for Network unavailability
In a study of Enterprise networks the following items were discovered to be the primary cause for
network unavailability.
1. Lack of best practices for change control
2. Lack of best practices for monitoring of the relevant components
3. Lack of best practices for requirements and procurement
4. Lack of best practices for overall operations
5. Lack of best practices for avoidance of network failures
6. Lack of best practices for avoidance of internal application failures
7. Lack of best practices for avoidance of external services that fail
8. Lack of best practices for physical environment
9. Lack of best practices for network redundancy
10. Lack of best practices for technical solutions for backup
11. Lack of best practice process solution of backup
12. Lack of best practices for physical location
13. Lack of best practices for infrastructure redundancy
14. Lack of best practices for storage architecture redundancy
Security Considerations
1. As in assessing the reliability requirements, security has the same consideration that
should be remembered. The surety of the end-to-end network is as good as the
weakest link.
2. How should the network security requirements be classified? Is it considered a “life
line” service or is it just a “data transport”?
5.2.4 Network Element-Alerting Authorities
As part of the Working Groups discussions, we observed the need for a set of best practices to
guide both emergency managers and the systems development community in the process of
CAP EAS message origination. While additional effort may be needed here to assist both
emergency management and product developers, we assembled the following set of best
practices as a starting point.
Page 19 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
Before you begin, complete the following:
1. Complete the FEMA IPAWS Basic Course IS-247.a
2. Message origination tool must comply with CAP 1.2 protocol, IPAWS 1.0 profile
and ECIG implementation guide.
3. Have proper credentials and digital signatures for the CAP aggregator for which
you are originating.
4. Review your particular State’s FCC approved State Plan.
As we observed in currently requirements for Alerting Authorities there overall appears to be no
common physical network security requirements established. Similarly, there does not appear to
be any common criteria for data security.
1. The Working Group also find that there has been little consideration to of how to
implement a “multimedia” server that would be needed to host audio files and
other resource elements a Federal, state or local Alerting Authority may seek to
make available to CAP EAS devices.
The Working Group similar found there has been little in the way of guidance to date for any
potential requirements or specifications to support a multimedia or streaming server to support
real-time live audio. The Working Group’s observation was that this type of requirement would
reasonably have been inferred to be a matter of compliance with the Presidential Order that the
network be capable in carrying the EAN alert (Presidential Alert).
It is clear that both the FCC and many EAS participants expected the new CAP-based capability
to support EAN messaging. The FCC’s Fifth Report and Order on EAS states (paragraph 116)
that the Commission “amending section 11.21 (a) to make clear that the State EAS Plans specify
the monitoring assignments and the specific primary and backup path for SAME-formatted EANs
and that the monitoring requirements for CAP-formatted EANs are set forth in section 11.52.”
Section 11.52 (EAS code and Attention Signal Monitoring Requirements) requires EAS
Participants to monitor FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) for CAP
EAN messages.
1. This issue ripples thru the entire network; it not only affects the alerting
authorities, but the remaining elements of the network.
Security and reliability remain a concern as this origination point is neither reliable nor secure.
The point of point of origin acts as a single point of failure, providing a very low reliability function,
there by affecting the network’s overall reliability.
1. Consideration should be given to allowing an interactive link between the point of
origin and the end point (alert aggregator). Assuring that message delivery was
achieved.
2. Depending on the characterization of the overall network reliability should be
addressed. As it is now the reliability maybe less than 90% (one nine).
Page 20 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
5.2.5 Network Element - Alert Aggregation / Distribution
Considerations for alert aggregation.
1. The details concerning this network are very limited. It has been stated that an internal
effort of achieving five nines of reliability (99.999%) was being explored.
2. Even if five nines of reliability can be achieved within the alert aggregator that does not
equate to an end-to-end system reliability achievement.
3. All stake holder parties involved with each network element must work together in order
to achieve true end-to-end reliability.
4. Security is again a concern because so little is known as to the actual capabilities of the
current alert aggregator. Whether this aggregator is local, state or Federal in nature, our
recommendation is that “Best Practices and Standards must be both identified and
universally utilized throughout the network.
5.2.6 Network Element - Alert Disseminators
These points of monitoring end points are:
1. EAS Participants including broadcast television
2. Broadcast radio
3. Cable television
4. IPTV
5. Direct broadcast satellite services.
With this wide array of monitoring points, maintaining a reliable and secure connection requires
the FCC-mandated CAP devices need to be either an intelligent connection (connection aware)
or a incorporate a secure transport (for example, VPN).
Within broadcast TV and radio, the monitoring end-point for CAP is effectively the broadcast
facility. By comparison, cable and IPTV systems may push the CAP alert content to the set-top
box in the customer premise itself.
It has been discovered that the hardware being used by the alert disseminators needs to support
either internal or external security measures (firewall, etc.) in order to achieve overall network
security.
We identified that one CAP EAS equipment manufacturer has published recommendations and
best practices on securing the Alert Disseminator network element.4 These best practices
include the creation of a “defense in depth” strategy by EAS Participants that entails multiple
layers of defense to prevent intrusions and attacks against critical systems. Defense in depth
measures are intended to not only prevent security breaches, but also buy an organization time to
detect and respond to an attack, thereby reducing and mitigating the consequences of a breach.
We directly draw upon those published best practices with the below recommendations:
4 “CAP, EAS and IPAWS: Introducing a defense-in-depth Security Strategy for Cable and IPTV Operations”
(September 2011) Monroe Electronics.
Page 21 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
Defense-in-depth involves using a number of layers. There are a number of options that EAS
Participants, including the addition of a strong firewall and intrusion protection system in front of
the CAP EAS equipment, creation of a DMZ, and use of a reverse proxy server within a DMZ.
There are many additional options that should we have not discussed in the confines of this
paper, such as network address translation (NAT), and adding additional obscurity.
The firewall is a first layer of defense; the proxy may be the second; using NAT, a third; obscuring
the type of system adds another layer of defense. The Working Group concurs with the overall
recommendations and best practices of a defense-in-depth strategy to defend the networks and
infrastructure of EAS Participants, as identified in the EAS manufacturer's white paper:
1. Protect the local and wide area communications networks (e.g. from Denial
of Service Attacks).Provide confidentiality and integrity protection for data
transmitted over these networks (e.g. use encryption and traffic flow security
measures to resist passive monitoring)
2. Defend the Enclave Boundaries (e.g. deploy Firewalls and Intrusion
Detection to resist active network attacks)
3. Defend the Computing Environment (e.g. provide access controls on hosts
and servers to resist insider, close-in, and distribution attacks).
However, we find that the lack of specific guidance or recommendations on security issues from
government and alert dissemination sources to have been a significant area of oversight. The
Working Group feels that it is critical that additional best practices and guidance be furnished to
EAS Participants, from the FCC (or other agency), as well as from industry sources.
5.2.7 Network Element - EAS Clients
Both reliability and security are a concern to the EAS Participant, given that the edge device must
attach the Internet and interface to their network. Security is a primary concern and therefore
should be prioritized as such. At present there is minimal security implemented in the delivery
path the EAS Participant.
Reliability should not be over-looked either at present there is no effective method to insure that
an alert is received by the EAS Participant. At present the EAS participant must pull (request) the
message from the Alert Aggregator. If the request is interrupted the EAS Participant must wait
another polling cycle before trying again.
Page 22 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
5.3 Findings and Observations
a) The current design of the CAP architecture was meant to utilize as many legacy EAS
participant devices as possible. This may have precluded the optimal design criteria for
network reliability and security.
b) The WG has a general consensus that the government should undertake the ability to initiate
CAP EAN in order to properly address the regulatory requirements on EAS participants
established under the Fifth Report and Order.
c) The WG strongly advises that the legacy EAS system should remain in place as a required
parallel system, and continue to operate in order to provide a reliable, redundant pathway for
Federal-level emergency messaging through broadcast media, in the event of a national
emergency.
d) The WG agreed that there needs to be a generally known, published and identifiable
requirements and timeline for implementing a CAP EAN that all stakeholders can organize
around (including government, EAS Participants, EAS manufacturers).
e) The WG also noted all stakeholder need to be involved in the CAP EAN design process in
some form, and that the government should take proactive efforts to coordinate with
stakeholders. These stakeholders include:
6. EAS device manufacturers – to ensure compatibility with government design choices,
and the CAP EAS equipment that has previously been installed since June 30, 2012.
7. EAS participants – to ensure they are properly informed of bandwidth and
connectivity requirements to support a CAP EAN audio stream (compared with a
basic IPAWS CAP XML file).
8. Federal agencies – principally DHS FEMA, the FCC and the National Weather
Service, to ensure that all parties coordinate on the capabilities to be developed, and
the timeline under which they would be deployed.
f) The WG observed that there would likely be a need for related standards/profiles to be
updated (i.e. the ECIG Implementation Guide and potentially the IPAWS Profile).
g) Efforts must be undertaken to effectively synchronize the messaging between the radio-
based PEP and IP-based CAP dissemination systems, including facilitating detection of
message duplication.
h) The WG also observed that FCC will need to coordinate with EAS participants, to understand
any added requirements a CAP EAN capability will entail (such as any additional IP
bandwidth connectivity requirements, etc.).
Page 23 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
5.4 Findings (State and Local)
5.4.1 State and Local EAS CAP Implementation
State and local governments have made great strides in implementation of CAP alerting. The
Working Group reviewed four distinct case studies in report dated June 2012 of state and local
CAP architectures, representing a diversity of technical approaches, using different background
technologies. (See appendix)
There have also been a variety of approaches used for implementation. Some state and local
governments have taken a top down approach (Washington State) while others have taken more
of a grass roots approach (Michigan). (See appendix)
5.4.2 Distribution Network Architectures
There was also distinct difference in CAP EAS distribution network architectures – with some
systems relying on internet dissemination, others relying on satellite dissemination, and another
system using satellite and Internet in tandem.
5.4.3 Service Model Differences
There are also service model differences, one would encompass being “hosted by a third party”
or an in-house deployed network server model.
5.4.4 Additional Differences
We observed additional differences in approaches to authentication and security among these
case studies. While one system may rely on usage of the IPAWS digital signature credentialing
for their own message authentication, another may incorporate both end-to-end encryption and
authentication measures, while another may rely on simple posting of CAP messages on a
webpage or RSS feed. While all four case studies cite interoperability with the FEMA IPAWS
system, utilization of IPAWS by these different systems range from reference to the FEMA
system as a redundant backup path, to reliance on IPAWS as a primary means of dissemination.
5.4.5 Early Adoption
Finally, early adoption was a key challenge for many states. Many protocols including CAP itself
was in an infantile state and required further development for the implementers. Also funding and
support may be scarce and there may not be enough trained individuals to provide operations
and technical support.
Page 24 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
5.4.6 Looking Ahead
Many questions arise when looking ahead for state and local. There are currently new delivery
methods for broadcasters including:
1. ATSC Mobile
2. HD Radio
3. Radio Data System
4. RDS
5. Text of which nearly 80% of FM radio broadcasters support.
How do these new delivery opportunities for broadcasters work with legacy and CAP alerts?
With increase adaption of CAP will create an ability to provide emergency alerting access for
entities such as schools and universities, municipalities, local law enforcement which previously
did not exist.
There will need to be both awareness and outreach to the public on CAP/EAS so expectations
can be properly managed. In addition much needed training to get operating personnel up to
speed on new systems will need to occur in the future and best practices will need to be
established. This could create broader liability and burden on existing local budgets.
With regard to EAS messages these new entities will need to work closely with state and local
State Emergency Communication Committees (SECC) and Local Emergency Communication
Committees (LECC).

6 Recommendations
6.1 The Emergency Action Notification [EAN] and CAP
6.1.1 Expectations of a CAP EAN
47 CFR Part 11 contains rules and regulations addressing the nation’s Emergency Alert System
(EAS). The EAS provides the President with the capability to provide immediate communications
and information to the general public at the national, state and local area level during periods of
national emergency. This capability is typified in the Emergency Action Notification (EAN) event
code. The EAN alert is unique among all other EAS codes in several respects:
• The EAN provides the originator with audio messaging length of unlimited duration (all
other EAS event codes are limited to two minute duration).
• The EAN alert must be carried at any time, and cannot be “filtered” out by the EAS
participant.
The EAS also provides state and local governments and the National Weather Service with the
capability to provide immediate communications and information to the general public concerning
emergency situations posing a threat to life and property. Regardless, a primary role for the EAS
system is the dissemination of the Emergency Action Notification.
It is clear that both the FCC and many EAS participants expected the new CAP-based capability
to support EAN messaging. The FCC’s Fifth Report and Order on EAS states (paragraph 116)
that the Commission “amending section 11.21 (a) to make clear that the State EAS Plans specify
the monitoring assignments and the specific primary and backup path for SAME-formatted EANs
and that the monitoring requirements for CAP-formatted EANs are set forth in section 11.52.”
Section 11.52 (EAS code and Attention Signal Monitoring Requirements) requires EAS
Participants to monitor FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) for CAP
EAN messages.
The EAS CAP Implementation Guidelines, which were formally adopted by the FCC alongside
the IPAWS CAP profile and Common Alerting Protocol.
6.1.2 Constructing EAS Streaming Audio from CAP V1.2 IPAWS v1.0 Profile
Where a streaming audio message intended for EAS use accompanies the CAP message in a
CAP <resource> block, such as for an EAS EAN message, the EAS streaming audio message is
constructed as follows:
1. As required by the IPAWS profile, the CAP <resourceDesc> element value SHALL be
“EAS Broadcast Content.”
2. The audio SHALL use one of the following streaming methods:
a. MP3 streaming as either HTTP progressive-download streaming, or
b. HTTP streaming MP3 server.
Further, the ECIG guidelines also provide a hypothetical example of a CAP EAN message (see
Section 5.3, ECIG Guidelines). That example points to how the audio resource can have a very
important difference in a National Alert.
Page 26 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
“The EAN and EAT National alerts are designed to broadcast live (they can of course still be pre-
recorded audio) from the White House to the American public. A CAP alert can reference a
slightly delayed, progressively downloaded live audio stream carrying this alert message.
The audio stream SHOULD be able to start from the beginning in order that none of the important
message is lost. The example shows how an audio resource could be constructed to provide this
reference”
6.1.3 CAP EAN Streamed Audio Message for IPAWS OPEN
The IPAWS architectural design supporting a CAP-based EAN alert streamed audio message
has yet to be tested. Informal conversations with IPAWS staff have indicated that a CAP EAN
streamed audio message capability is supported.
However, to date, the government has not provided any additional specifications for a CAP-based
EAN, including audio stream requirements other than to state that the OPEN design is compatible
with the ECIG guidelines.
As noted in the ECIG recommendations, the unique nature of an EAN message would not rely on
text to speech capability, and would require usage of either downloaded audio file resource, or
access to a “live” IP audio stream. Both resources would ostensibly be sought by the CAP EAS
device from a third party server or media resource, defined within the CAP message.
The lack of a tested EAN streaming audio message capability over CAP appears to be highly
problematic from a technical, operational and regulatory perspective. From a technical and
operational perspective, all EAS Participants were to have procured, installed and have operating
their FCC-compliant CAP EAS equipment by or before 30 June 2012. To the working group’s
understanding, EAS Participants have to a great extent worked to comply with that regulatory
mandate.
However, this CAP EAS equipment was designed and furnished to the CAP and EAS
specifications that were available at that point in time. Therefore, tens of thousands of CAP EAS
units have already been deployed throughout the nation, and any changes in specifications to
accommodate a streaming CAP-based EAN would impact this previously installed equipment.
While most of this CAP EAS equipment appears to be software or firmware upgradeable, the
issuance of any new specification would appear to place the burden on the specification
developer (the government) to provide a specification that is compatible with any software and
hardware limitations in this previously-installed equipment.
It appears that much of the rationale for the adoption of CAP by the FCC, and the regulatory
requirement for EAS participants to implement upgraded CAP EAS capabilities had been based
upon the existence of a CAP EAN message in addition to a conventional radio-based EAS CAP
message. The conventional broadcast EAN (via the Primary Entry Point system) provides a
highly resilient capability for EAN dissemination. This is crucial particularly in light of
circumstances which might surround actual usage of a national Emergency Action Notification.
However, the regulatory requirements for a CAP EAN (including the issue that CAP EAS was in
part predicated on the existence of a CAP EAN), infers that the omission of a CAP-based EAN
capability operating in parallel with the broadcast EAS-based EAN is a situation that needs to be
rectified in the very near term.
Page 27 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
6.1.4 Recommendation
1. The working group has a general consensus that the government should undertake
testing and if necessary further development of a CAP EAN streaming audio message
capability. We feel that such testing of a CAP EAN streaming audio message capability
proceed with all deliberate speed, in order to properly address the regulatory
requirements on EAS participants established under the Fifth Report and Order.
2. The WG strongly advises that the existing EAS audio (radio) relay based on the Primary
Entry Point (PEP) system should remain in place as a required parallel system, and
continue to operate in order to provide a reliable, redundant pathway for Federal-level
emergency messaging through broadcast media, in the event of a national emergency.
3. The WG agreed that there needs to be a generally known, published and identifiable
requirements and timeline for implementing a CAP EAN that all stakeholders can
organize around (including government, EAS Participants, EAS manufacturers).
4. The WG also noted all stakeholder need to be involved in the CAP EAN design process
in some form, and that the government should take proactive efforts to coordinate with
stakeholders. These stakeholders include:
i. EAS manufacturers – to ensure compatibility with government design choices,
and the CAP EAS equipment that has previously been installed since June 30,
2012.
ii. EAS participants – to ensure they are properly informed of bandwidth and
connectivity requirements to support a CAP EAN audio stream (compared with
a basic IPAWS CAP XML file).
iii. Federal agencies – principally DHS FEMA, the FCC and the National Weather
Service, to ensure that all parties coordinate on the capabilities to be
developed, and the timeline under which they would be deployed.
5. The WG observed that there would likely be a need for related standards/profiles to be
updated (i.e. the ECIG Implementation Guide and potentially the IPAWS Profile.
6. Efforts must be undertaken to effectively synchronize the messaging between the radio-
based PEP and IP-based CAP dissemination systems, including facilitating detection of
message duplication.
7. The WG also observed that FCC will need to coordinate with EAS participants, to
understand any added requirements a CAP EAN capability will entail (such as any
additional IP bandwidth connectivity requirements, etc.).

6.2 FCC Equipment Certification Issues
6.2.1 Potential Impact of Future Spec Changes on Existing FCC-Certified CAP EAS
Equipment
As CAP requirements evolve in the future, and as CAP EAS equipment manufacturers offer
improvements and enhancements to their products, the working group discussed the potential for
such a change to impact the FCC certification requirements surrounding such equipment, as well
as the potential need for re-testing under related programs, such as the IPAWS Conformity
Assessment Program. (The permissive change rules in Section 2.1043 describe the modifications
that may be made to an RF device without filing for a new equipment authorization; define the
three different types of permissive changes; and identify when a permissive change (PC) filing
with the Commission is required).
Part of the difficulty in clearly identifying what types of changes would require a permissive
change filling – or even re-certification – may stem from the issue that CAP EAS equipment are
not strictly RF devices (per se), though they are required to follow the same certification
processes of RF equipment.
The understanding of the working group is that when a government-certified device is modified,
all proposed changes must be considered to determine the type of change filing required. For
example, a software/firmware change to add support for streaming media capabilities (for CAP
EAN message) could very conceivably require authorization by a “permissive change” filing.
Because of the CAP EAS equipment certification requirements set forth by the FCC, equipment
of this type was required to furnish a Suppliers Declaration of Conformity (processed though the
IPAWS Conformity Testing Program), or similar Test Report.
Further, a change in CAP, IPAWS or ECIG specifications would appropriately seem to require
some form of re-testing under the IPAWS Conformity Assessment Program (as the program itself
asserted that any significant changes to the products after initial testing would require
resubmission to the testing process – though it appears to be left to the manufacturer to
determine what a significant change might be).
6.2.2 Issues Related to FCC Certification Process
Because of FCC guidance on certifying CAP EAS equipment appears primarily focused on the
initial certification of CAP compliance, the working group felt that the FCC should provide
additional guidance to the manufacturing community as to what types of changes may (or may
not) trigger a permissive change filing, a CAP conformity re-testing, and/or re-certification.
6.2.3 Issues Related to IPAWS Conformity Assessment Program
A related issue is that of how the FCC CAP EAS certification process and IPAWS Conformity
Assessment process interrelate. FCC CAP EAS certification relies in large part upon the
existence of a Suppliers Declaration of Conformity (as processed through the IPAWS CA testing
process). However, that Declaration of Conformity references specific software versions and
software-hardware combinations.
Page 29 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
What types of changes to software are permissible without requiring either an IPAWS conformity
retest or permissive change filing? What material changes would necessitate a retest or filing? If
a manufacturer even changes its software version (as specifically referenced in the SDoC and
Test Report), does it technically risk its FCC CAP EAS certification?
6.2.4 Issues Related to Future Testing
Finally, testing of CAP EAS equipment’s ability to physically access the IPAWS server was not
part of the original conformance tests. Such verification was also not part of the Class II
permissive change filing required by the Fifth Report & Order. Compliance with a transport
specification (such as the IPAWS RSS ATOM feed) has so far not been a part of either formal
Part 11 certification testing or the IPAWS Conformity Assessments. This may be a major
oversight in the equipment certification regime, one that may present additional problems should
additional transport and signaling requirements be added in the future.
6.2.5 CSRIC WG 9 Recommendations
1. The working group recommends that the FCC provide additional clarification and
guidance for the manufacturing community as to what product (and specifically
software) modifications may require a permissive change filing, conformity retest,
recertification, or no action required on the part of the manufacturer.
2. The working group recommends that the FCC coordinate with IPAWS to ensure that
the P-TAC Center continue providing CAP 1.2 USA IPAWS Profile 1.0 message
conformance testing with no-cost to the test or creating the report until the technology
is mature or another suitable testing unit is available.
3. The working group recommends that a check for conformance to the IPAWS-OPEN
transport interface (currently Atom) be added to the P-TAC test, and that a check for
conformance to the EAN streaming format be added once it is defined by FEMA.

6.3 EAS Duplicate Message Handling
6.3.1 Summary
• Discuss ongoing need for EAS
• Discuss causes of the problem
• Mention that CAP makes it worse
• Introduce concept of message id
• Discuss how to add message id to existing EAS protocol that is minimally invasive and
transparent to legacy devices
6.3.2 Finding
The nationwide Emergency Alert System (EAS) provides an effective and efficient method of
public alert message dissemination by leveraging a large network of radio, television, cable and
satellite television operators to achieve a robust and redundant method of conveying messages
to the listening and viewing public. Moreover, while sometimes referred to as “legacy EAS” its
broadcast roots remain the most effective communication method when other land-based or
wired communication infrastructures may have collapsed.
In addition the number of broadcast users is unrestricted and unrestrained offering the most
economical means to reach a mass audience – regardless of audience size.
To help assure message delivery EAS participants monitor at least two, and in some cases,
more, sources of FSK audio EAS messages. Messages are originated or relayed by one or more
of these monitored sources, thereby EAS participants may receive the same message multiple
times. As such, the detection of duplicate messages is an essential part of the EAS system. By
properly detecting and handling duplicate EAS messages a broadcast station or cable operator is
prevented from sending the same message multiple times.
An EAS device stores recently received messages and compares each newly received message
to the stored copies. A byte-by-byte comparison is done for each message. The message
elements compared include the three-byte originator code, the three-byte event code, list of
locations codes, the start time, and the duration5. Messages that match are duplicates, and all
but the first received version are ignored.
This duplicate detection method works as intended, weeding out expected duplicate EAS
messages if multiple stations relay each alert. However, it falls short, when the same audio
portion of the message (audio payload) is included in multiple, non-duplicate, EAS messages.
While this may sound obvious the resultant audio payload repetition is the problem because, if
any one or more of the message comparison elements are different, the message is NOT
considered the same emergency alert – although it may contain the same audio message. Since
the EAS device sees different data elements, it can transmit multiple copies of what appears to
the public as the same information.
This unfortunate aspect of EAS has always been present, but is rarely seen mainly due to
geographical boundaries. Moreover, since retransmission of most EAS message(s) is voluntary,
extra interruptions for the same information leads to audience fatigue (a kind of “cry wolf”
syndrome), wasted airtime, and unhappy station owners.
5
The call sign of each relay point is not included in the comparison.
Page 31 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
Duplicate messages are mainly caused by two cases:
1 The National Weather Service (NWS) transmits information regarding a large storm
over multiple NOAA transmitters, using a different, but overlapping, list of location
codes on each transmitter.
2 Two different civil authorities issue a message, typically a required monthly test, with an
overlapping set of location codes, on different transmitters.
For example, assume a large storm system causes the NWS to issue an alert over multiple
NOAA transmitters. Each transmitter sends the message to the location codes in its coverage
area. For example, NOAA transmitter number one sends the message to counties A, B, and C.
NOAA transmitter number two sends the message to counties C, D, and E. The problem is the
two transmitters send two messages covering county C. Since they have different location lists
the messages are not considered duplicate EAS messages, therefore a station in county C could
relay both messages even though the audio payload is identical.
In the past, most stations have been protected against this source of message duplication
because natural RF barriers kept the messages from multiple origination points from being widely
distributed forming a “geographic shield”. Also, receiving stations rarely monitor two NOAA
transmitters, or an EAS relay point that would have relayed both messages.
In some parts of the country, however, the problem can, and does, occur as in the civil case,
alerts to boundary regions, typically in large counties or along state borders, civil authorities on
either side of the region will sometimes use overlapping location lists. However, with EAS
messages disseminated to all EAS Participants via the FEMA's IPAWS CAP feed the geographic
shield is removed. Every station can “hear” both the original CAP alert and the version
transmitted by their local NOAA transmitter. If the NOAA transmitter sends a subset of the full
location list in the CAP message to EAS, unintentional EAS duplicates have been
generated. Both versions could be aired by broadcast stations and cable head-ends.
This is a general problem - any time a single CAP message can generate more than one EAS
message, undetectable duplicates in the EAS domain have been created.
6.3.3 Recommendation
What is needed is a method for originators to tag EAS messages with additional data to allow
newer or upgradable equipment a means to uniquely identify the source message and provide
better duplicate message handling while simultaneously not creating problems for existing
equipment.
CAP, with its larger set of data elements and greater bandwidth can easily solve the problem, but
legacy EAS has much lower bandwidth and a very small set of data elements; moreover it cannot
break existing equipment, or require substantial replacement.
Page 32 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
Three problem Cases
1. The same source of information may be used to generate multiple CAP messages –
possibly with different sent times.
2. The same CAP message is used to generate multiple EAS messages (e.g., the NWS
case where an event covers more than 31 locations or more than 1 NOAA transmitter
coverage area with different location lists).
3. Two different originators are sending the same information as an EAS message, either
to different location lists, and/or with a different origination time stamp.
There is no clean way to take the existing EAS spec and disambiguate two alerts with the same
originator, time, and event, duration, but overlapping lists of location codes. We can guess, and
maybe get it right much of the time, but that's no way to run an essentially automated system.
One solution path is to add something to the spec that will provide a higher-level alert id, so that
an EAS message with the same time, event, and originator, but a different set of location codes,
but the same alert id, would be tagged as a duplicate. If the alert id is strong enough, possible to
even loosen the constraint that the time stamp match and duration exactly - solving another NWS
problem.
The intent for EAS is not to do a globally unique string like the CAP combination of sent, sender,
and identifier elements - this way is too long. Even a 128 bit GUID is longer than needed. A
number long enough to disambiguate the alerts issued that hour could suffice, 10 or 11 bits
should suffice.
These can be encoded into two extra bytes. There are many ways to add this additional
information, including;
1) Add a few bytes to the end of the ZCZC string, after the LLLLLL-. This should not
confuse legacy devices as they stop listening after the last '-', it won't sound different to
the ear, and should not confuse any other EAS device (like Radio Shack S.A.M.E
receivers). It also delivers the alert id before any other switching action would occur in
new EAS devices that are putting the alert on the air while it is still being received. It
would require a change to NWS consoles (that part that generates the headers).
2) Add a trio of short headers after the attn tone. Might confuse some legacy devices that
simply listen for any valid bytes to start a receive process. Could use different sync
bytes to avoid that. It will sound different to the ear. Would require a change to NWS
consoles.
3) Send the alert id as a location code. Pick an unused state code that would mean alert
id, use the CCC part as the alert ID. This would not require a change to the generation
of the ZCZC string at the NWS, just the addition of an otherwise bogus location
code. Reduces total available for real locations to 30.
4) Add additional FSK data to the audio payload. These short “braps” would allow
additional message ID information to be encoded as part of the specific message itself.
By using a different preamble the data is ignored by legacy devices and is always
passed without a problem.
Page 33 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
The message will sound differently to an astute listener, but not so much as to be
annoying due to the short nature of the “brap” and could be considered as part of the
attention tones, and would require changes to the NWS audio message generation, but
no changes to the actual EAS generator.
Following this method does not require modification of the current Part 11 coding
structure and could be quickly adopted as an addendum to the current decoding
practice by all EAS vendors. Also, using this method provides a more extensible means
to encode any additional data that may be considered important in the future. While
current thinking is the addition of two-bytes for a unique message ID is good, there may
be a future need for more data and this method provides a much easier path to future
expansion.
All of these require some action by NWS to provide the alert id, and an alert id parameter would
need to be added to the CAP message for 1), 2) and 4). Any of these this would allow a much
better method to determine which alerts are duplicates, even if the locations, and possible the
time/duration, differ. It cannot by the EAS/CAP devices alone since additional data input is
needed.
Any solution will need to be tested to; A) validate EAS duplicate messages are properly filtered
and, B) ensure legacy EAS devices and legacy radio receivers, including those used as inputs to
EAS devices and in consumer devices, are not adversely impacted by the solution. NOAA’s
National Weather Service (NWS) encourages consumers purchase receivers that display the
Public Alert logo indicating that it meets certain performance criteria including SAME decoding.
The NWS and others worked with the Consumer Electronic Association (CEA) to develop the
Receiver Performance Specification for Public Alert Receivers (CEA-2009-B (ANSI)), a voluntary
standard that defines minimum performance criteria for consumer electronic products designed to
receive SAME alert signals. NWS Directive System 10-1712, NOAA Weather Radio (NWR)
Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME), describes the format and use of NWR SAME from
which EAS SAME was derived.

6.4 Usability of CAP Message Text for Direct-to- Broadcast Use
6.4.1 Description of the Issue
As stated in the OASIS CAP standard:
“CAP allows a consistent warning message to be disseminated simultaneously over many
different warning systems, thus increasing warning effectiveness while simplifying the warning
task”6
The WG takes note, however, that different warning systems have different technical limitations
and different audiences for the information. When using CAP to generate EAS messages, the
CAP data is presented directly to a broad general public, audience. The contents of the
description and instruction fields are used to:
1. Provide the text used for video crawls and page by page displays for TV and Cable.
2. Provide text used for radio-based text systems, such as the text capabilities of HD radio
and RDS.
3. Provide the input for text to speech generators, either centrally located at a reply point, or
in the end point CAP/EAS devices.
In all of these cases, there is no human processing of the data once it leaves the originator.
Particularly in radio and cable; most radio stations and cable head-ends are unattended some of
each day, and some stations and cable head-ends are unattended most of each day. There is no
human the loop.
The following discussion is primarily based on the NWS use of CAP for EAS, because they have
been, and will likely continue to be, the originator of the largest number of EAS-bound messages.
The general observations and recommendations apply to all CAP messages intended for
broadcast via EAS, not just NWS messages.
The WG is concerned that the text of CAP messages currently provided by the NWS may not
suitable for direct use by the general public via the broadcast medium. NWS messages have
been successfully used for many years by many people and automated processes, however,
these users have always needed to make an effort to obtain the information, and are likely to be
self-selected to know what they are looking for, and by experience, better understand what they
get. Once NWS goes live on CAP/EAS, a new and different community of users will be involved,
who won’t be expecting the information and won’t be as prepared to make allowances and
assumptions about what they are getting.
In particular, we note the content of the messages includes abbreviations, time in a different
standard format, email addresses, telephone numbers, web page addresses, use of upper case
only, limited use of punctuation, and lengthy lists of locations.
Some messages are short, but may be hard to read as a video crawl, for example:
AT 1237 PM CST...NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR INDICATED
A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM CAPABLE OF PRODUCING A TORNADO. THIS
6 Common Alerting Protocol Version 1.2, OASIS Emergency Management Technical Committee, July , 2010,

SHELTER AND PROTECT YOURSELF FROM FLYING DEBRIS.
Without training, Text to Speech engines may interpret the text “AT 1237 PM CST” as a voice
output of “at one thousand two hundred thirty seven”. Human readers or a video crawl will have
trouble with all capital letters and the use of the “…” strings.
Some messages are far from usable for EAS broadcast. Although most EAS Operational Plans
do not advocate broadcast of flood warnings (FLW), this recent flood warning highlights the
issues in some messages intended for broadcast…

The ECIG guidelines would concatenate the description and instruction field.
The WG is aware that these messages are only being sent to the test server, but it is unclear
what, if any, changes will be made to the format and content of these messages before they go
live. The NWS continues work on business rules, SAME message replication methods and
programming code to create CAP EAS messages at a central facility for the IPAWS production
platform.
Page 36 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
6.4.2 Recommendations
1. We recommend that the NWS publish guidance that can be used for text to speech, to
the extent that they do not (substantially) conflict with existing standards and practices
already adopted within TTS engines.
2. We recommend that a set of acceptance criteria be developed, with the input of the
broadcast/cable community, and that these criteria be met before NWS messages are
made available on the production IPAWS OPEN system.
3. We recommend that the NWS and FEMA consider that the general CAP description and
instruction fields do not allow the NWS to maintain its existing formats used by legacy
data consumers while also being useful for direct to the public automated broadcast.
Therefore an additional broadcast data field, such as the EASText field recommended by
ECIG, but not accepted by FEMA, should be reconsidered.

7 Best Practices
7.1 Best Practice for Message Origination
As part of the Working Groups discussions, we observed the need for a set of best practices to guide
both emergency managers and the systems development community in the process of CAP EAS
message origination. While additional effort may be needed here to assist both emergency management
and product developers, we assembled the following set of best practices as a starting point.
Before you begin, complete the following:
1. Complete the FEMA IPAWS Basic Course IS-247.a
2. Message origination tool must comply with CAP 1.2 protocol, IPAWS 1.0 profile and ECIG
implementation guide.
3. Have proper credentials and digital signatures for the CAP aggregator for which you are
originating.
4. Review your particular State’s FCC approved State Plan.
CAUTION: CAP is a very useful tool to originate and disseminate emergency information over
a variety of platforms. CAP is very versatile, but in order for CAP messages to be processed
by the Emergency Alert System on radio, television, cable, and other EAS Participants, there
are fields in a CAP message that are mandatory for EAS processing, even if they are optional
for CAP.
7.2 CAP Message Preparation
One of the purposes of this document is to assist in preparation of CAP messages that will be ultimately
broadcast on radio, television, cable and other media. The CAP origination tool that you have should
assist you in this process. Most references in this document are to the ECIG Recommendation for CAP
EAS Implementation Guide which may be found on the ECIG website.
Note: Before any CAP message is processed by an aggregator, it must conform to OASIS CAP v1.2. The
message should also conform to the current FEMA CAP Profile, which may be found at www.fema.gov/.
7.3 EAS and CAP Audio
Audio can be a critical component of an EAS message. CAP provides at least two basic methods for
audio to be transported and inserted in a resultant EAS message.
• An audio file can be inserted as a resource block, i.e. a uniform reference identifier (URI) location
for an audio file, and more specifically a uniform resource locator (URL), or
• The audio can be converted with Text to Speech from the description and instruction elements of
the info block, in accord with the ECIG CAP-EAS Implementation Guidelines as formally adopted
by the Commission.
Page 38 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
Although Text to Speech is an optional by current FCC Part 11 rules, the originator must realize that
without one of these two methods, no audio will be present in the resultant EAS message. The only
audible sound the listener will hear will be the EAS header codes, the Attention Signal, and the End-of-
Message signal. Note that IPAWS currently depends on Text-to-Speech conversion.
Note: IPAWS currently depends on Text-to-Speech conversion. CAP Message Checklist
See EAS CAP Industry Group (ECIG) Recommendations for a CAP EAS Implementation Guide,
Version 1.0. Section 6.7
Web: http://eas-cap.org/ECIG-CAP-to-EAS_Implementation_Guide-V1-0.pdf
7.4 Best Practice for “Text to Speech”
A notification can be up to 1,800 characters and spaces in length, due to limitations on broadcast and
cable video displays. Various CAP message origination tools may allow message originators to enter text
that would be incorporated in the <description> and/or <instruction> elements of a CAP message. This
text would be rendered into synthetic speech by enabled CAP EAS devices, when such a message is
received (assuming a voice audio file was not present).
7.5 Message Originators
Message Originators should bear in mind that the content they input for text-to-speech would also be
viewed on screen via TV and cable systems. For this reason, phonetic renderings of text should be
avoided. To handle certain words, lexicons may need to be adjusted in CAP EAS device over time. In
addition, message originators should avoid excessive use of acronyms or jargon.
7.6 Alert Messages
Alert messages should optimally be succinct and to-the-point. If an alert message contains many words
and characters, originators should make use of punctuation such as periods and commas. This can better
pace the synthetic speech rendering of the sentences and helps the message content flow evenly and
properly. It can also prevent run-on sentences and incorrect intonation, which may confuse the recipient
and prevent him/her from understanding the content of the message.
7.7 Entry of Address or Extensions
As a general convention, entry of addresses or extensions with a large number of digits may necessitate
use of a space between each number.
For example, 32457 Safety Road should be entered in as 3 2 4 5 7 Safety Road.
7.8 Reference Guidelines
Refer to the stylistic guidelines indicated in FEMA’s IS-247 training course
(Lesson 2: Appropriate, Effective, and Accessible Alert and Warning Messages), as well as the style
guide recommendations listed in the EAS Style Guide Appendix.
7.9 Best Practice for SSL
CAP/EAS devices are, for the most part, unattended, embedded processor type systems. User
maintenance interactions need to be limited. Some user installations are remote and do not have inbound
Internet access for security reasons.
Page 39 of 46CSRIC III WG-IX
7.9.1 Common Root Certificates
CAP/EAS devices will have a set of common Root CA certificates that are updated slowly. They
may not be up to date with intermediate certificates. To avoid the necessity of loading
intermediate certificates, in the larger world of desktops, it has become a common practice for a
web server to send the server certificate as well as the various chained intermediate certificates.
Similarly, in the specialized environment of CAP/EAS device, sending the chain will allow the
CAP/EAS device to verify the chain of trust with only information from the SSL connection alone,
as long the device has the applicable Root CA certificate.
If a CAP server wants to use HTTPS/SSL access and support the widest range of CAP/EAS
devices, it must send all of the chained certificates (not including the Root CA) for SSL
connections.
A CAP/EAS device must provide a means for its users to update the store of Root CA certificates,
either by a firmware update, or a special certificate update.
CAP server owners should be aware that a change to the Root CA for its certificate chain,
especially when a new CA is used, might cause CAP/EAS devices to not be able to connect to
their server until the device manufactures can issue an update.
In addition, self-signed certificates may not work with all CAP/EAS devices, and should be
avoided.

Appendix - EAS Style Guide
The EAS Style Guide is intended to assist CAP originators in formulating the optional fields of a CAP message
that will be used for text-to-speech conversion, and display by character generators and various graphic
platforms.
EAS Messages All EAS messages are public; therefore, no information of a restricted or
private nature should be included.
EAS Text All EAS text should support, not contradict information that may be
contained in an encapsulated audio message that is a part of the CAP
message.
FCC Mandatory EAS Text Information derived from the FCC Mandatory EAS text, (i.e., originator,
event type, location, expiration) will already have been displayed, so it is not
necessary to repeat all of the information contained in the FCC Mandatory
EAS text EXCEPT for information of peculiar interest to the hearing impaired
community.
EAS Phrasing The EAS text must be fairly formal in its phrasing, but should not make over-
use of highly technical or discipline specific jargon. EAS text should be for a
target audience of third grade vocabulary and syntax.
Expression Expression should be clear and concise.
Message Details Details should be specific but must be limited to 1800 characters in order to
fit within the constraints of a two-minute audio message. Important details
should be repeated, but not lengthy.
Additional Message Details EAS text may be used to amplify or provide additional details about an
emergency situation but should not be overly repetitive.
Description of Emergency The first thing to convey is a brief description of the emergency; the second
thing to describe is the action that the listener/viewer needs to take
immediately; the third thing to describe is a pointer for additional details.
EAS Language The EAS is designed to “wake up” listeners/viewer to an emergency
condition, not provide a journalistic detail of events.

AFSK Audio frequency-shift keying (AFSK) is a modulation technique by which digital
data is represented by changes in the frequency (pitch) of an audio tone, yielding
an encoded signal suitable for transmission via radio or telephone. Normally, the
transmitted audio alternates between two tones: one, the "mark", represents a
binary one; the other, the "space", represents a binary zero.

(IPAWS-OPEN) to collect CAP alerts issued by authorized public officials and
distribute them to EAS Participants via an EAS CAP feed. The EAS CAP feed
will be available via the Internet; therefore EAS Participants will require an
Internet connection to poll IPAWS-OPEN. In addition, EAS Participants may poll
state CAP servers or other CAP-based networks via the Internet where
appropriate.

(tornado, flood, severe thunderstorm), the areas affected (up to 31 counties or
states), the expected duration of the event (in minutes), the date and time it was
issued (in UTC), and an identification of the originating station. (See SAME for a
