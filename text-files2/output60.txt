1 Results in Brief
1.1 Executive Summary
Working Group 10 of the Communications, Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council
(CSRIC) is focused on addressing Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) Powering.
“With the rapid proliferation of VoIP technologies as substitutes for legacy telecommunications
services, end-users are now utilizing a service that lacks the lifeline they were once accustomed
to. Instead of being powered from the resilient back-up power infrastructure in the serving
central office, the user’s home device is powered by a local battery when line power is lost, as
often happens during emergencies. Different communications providers have different policies
as it relates to powering these devices. This Working Group will recommend best practices for
providing back-up power to VoIP customer premises equipment, including best practices for
consumer notification.”1
CSRIC Working Group 10 structured itself into two vertical areas to address CPE best practices
and consumer notification.
2 Introduction
The CSRIC was established as a Federal Advisory Committee designed to provide
recommendations to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding best practices
and actions the Commission can take to ensure optimal security, reliability, and interoperability
of communications systems, including telecommunications, media and public safety
communications systems. CSRIC created ten working groups, each with its own area of
responsibility. Working Group 10 was charged with examining CPE powering best practices
and consumer notification. Working Group 10A was charged with taking a fresh look at CPE
powering consumer notification.
Consumers are increasingly seeking out and converting to VoIP technologies. In order to
prepare the consumer for the VoIP conversion, telecommunication service providers, industry
organizations, and the FCC should provide guidance to the consumer on how to prepare for a
loss in commercial power.

June, 2014
Final Report
The analysis included:
 Elimination of obsolete or irrelevant Recommendations and Best Practices
 Creation of references to materials and websites
 Development of new Recommendations and Best Practices
New Recommendations and Best Practices were vetted among Working Group 10 at meetings
and through email. When the sub-group had completed its analysis, the completed document
was forwarded to the Working Group Committee Leads. The Committee Leads assessed the
document and made recommendations for moving or removing items. After an agreement via
conference call and email, the final CSRIC Consumer Notification Recommendations and Best
Practices document was completed. It is attached as an appendix to this document.
4 Background
Prior to the rapid proliferation of VoIP technologies as substitutes for legacy
telecommunications services, consumers were relying on cordless handsets. Consumers should
have been made aware of the limitations of cordless handsets. Cordless handsets normally do
not have back-up battery units and will not work during a commercial power outage. Consumers
should know the difference between a wired handset and a cordless handset.
Consumers are increasingly selecting VoIP technology as their primary telecommunications
technology. VoIP technology is not powered by the back-up power infrastructure that served the
legacy central office. The consumer’s home device is powered by a local battery when
commercial power is lost. Different communications providers have different policies as it
relates to powering these devices.
It is important for the consumer to be informed of and understand the technology they are using,
the design of the battery back-up, and ways to conserve power during a commercial power
outage. It is also important for consumers to understand the capability of their communications
device to make a 911 call during a prolonged outage.
5 Analysis, Findings and Recommendations
5.1 Analysis and Findings
The working group agreed to explore consumer notification issues by reviewing public utility
commission complaints and responses, public utility press releases, and outage response and
restoration practices. The group members own experiences provided a starting point from which
the group further identified consumer notification efforts.

Final Report
5.2 Recommendations
CSRIC Working Group 10A recommends the attached set of Consumer and Service Provider
Recommendations to the FCC for consideration of adopting the best practices for general use by
consumers, industry, the FCC, and state and local government.
6 Conclusions
The CSRIC Working Group 10A spent more than six months researching, analyzing, and
evaluating Consumer Recommendations and Notification Best Practices. During this time
members participated in dozens of conference calls, identified gaps, and researched new
Recommendations and Best Practices, plus dedicated countless hours editing and revising the
final report.
In conclusion, members feel this Final Report is a fair and accurate representation of their
collective view-points and perspectives and hopes this will help to improve Consumer
Notification through these Best Practices.

2The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council – Consumer Recommendations
1. Introduction
All consumers face commercial power interruptions. These interruptions may be from natural or
man-made disasters and could last minutes, hours, days, or weeks depending on the severity of
the interruption. Consumers that rely on VoIP technology must understand the product they
have purchased, the range of battery back-up options commercially available, and the need to
conserve back-up battery power. Consumers should also understand that no network has 100%
survivability.
One challenge all consumers face is how to properly prepare for the loss of commercial power.
A goal of this document is to discuss strategies to aid in the creation of a methodology for
dealing with commercial power interruptions so that the design and use of back-up battery power
is understood. It would be impossible to foresee every possibility and therefore develop a
formula that covers all events. The discussion, then, should be around the general strategy for
managing back-up battery power during commercial power outages. Consumers should gain an
understanding of commercial power outage history in their area. This general approach for a
response to a commercial power outage can be best seen in the following:
Step 1: Develop a Communications Plan
Step 2: Acting During Commercial Power Outage
Step 3: Post-Outage Analysis
2. Step 1: Develop a Communications Plan
2.1. Identification and Preparation
Before a consumer can plan for a commercial power outage, they have to understand the
Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) they are using. In order to prepare for a commercial
outage, it is incumbent upon the consumer to know if their equipment has battery back-up power,
if they need to purchase additional battery back-up, how to purchase battery back-up, and the
lifespan of any purchased battery back-up power. Consumers need to have a plan to deal with
the inevitable possibility of a commercial power outage.
Preparation is one of the most important parts for consumers. Proper planning by the consumer
will provide the framework on which they can rely during a commercial power outage.
Consumers can prepare by obtaining key information concerning their CPE through specifically
designated storm preparation information or routine CPE information listed on their provider’s
website.
Consumers should understand that all rechargeable back-up batteries have finite lifetimes.
Purchasing and charging a back-up battery is not a one-time action. The back-up battery has to
be continually monitored for battery degradation. Consumers should create a back-up battery
maintenance and testing schedule in much the same way they do with their home smoke
3The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council – Consumer Recommendations
detectors.
Consumers should create a disaster response kit that they can use for commercial power outages.
Consumers should include plans for back-up battery power in the same way they have a plan for
food, water, replacement power (such as generators, charged cellphones), and fuel during a
disaster.
Consumers should understand the difference between talk time and standby time as it relates to
the depletion of back-up battery. Talk time (using the phone) will deplete the battery faster than
when the phone is in standby mode (not being used). In order to prolong the back-up battery life
during a commercial power outage, consumers should limit the amount of talk time.
2.2. Identification checklist for consumer:
1. Identify VoIP service provider.
2. Identify internet service provider.
3. Determine number and types of CPE in use for VoIP and internet.
a. Notes: The VoIP and internet service provider may or may not be the same
company.
4. Determine if back-up battery power is included with VoIP and internet CPE.
5. If back-up battery power is included, determine length of time of battery back-up power,
ways to conserve power, and if the back-up battery unit shuts down automatically before
the battery is fully depleted.
a. Examples:
i. Some units may not have a back-up battery unit and will not work without
electricity.
ii. Some VoIP back-up battery units will shut down an hour before the
battery is fully depleted. At that point, the consumer activates the reserve
power feature.
b. These are generic examples. Consumers should fully understand and document
the details for their specific equipment including how to determine battery status,
battery testing, and battery lifespan. This information can be provided by their
service providers at installation or obtained by consumers on a provider’s website.
6. Consumers should have a full understanding of the back-up battery, emergency usage,
and instructions for activating emergency usage, if available. The consumer should be
provided this information at the time of installation and retain it in their personal records.
7. Consumers should print and keep a copy of back-up battery details, emergency use
details, and instructions in their disaster kit.
8. If back-up battery power is not included, consumers should determine if they want to
purchase back-up battery power, what type to purchase, how much to purchase, and ways
to conserve power.
9. Determine how often the back-up battery(s) needs to be charged and how long it takes to
fully charge the back-up battery.
10. Determine how often back-up battery needs to be tested.
11. Determine how often back-up battery needs to be replaced and correct local, state, and
federal regulations for battery disposal procedures.
4The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council – Consumer Recommendations
12. Conduct trial run of back-up battery test, connection, and use.
2.3. Back-Up Battery Plan Template
1. Name of Electric company and company contact information (phone number, website
address, social media addresses).
2. Name of VoIP service provider and provider contact information (phone number, website
address, social media addresses).
2.1. Type of VoIP CPE including any provider information that addresses 911
connectivity.
3. Name of internet service provider and provider contact information (phone number,
website address, social media addresses).
3.1. Type of in internet CPE
3.2. Note: If the internet service provider is different than the VoIP service provider,
consumers need to understand the CPE of both providers and plan for additional
battery back-up for the internet modem.
4. Number of back-up battery hours installed, including any reserve power feature.
5. Number of additional back-up battery hours purchased.
6. If more than one back-up battery was purchased, date of last back-up battery charge.
7. Date of last back-up battery test.
8. Replacement date for back-up battery end of life.
3. Step 2: Acting During Commercial Power Outage
During a commercial power outage, consumers should determine when to switch to back-up
battery power. Consumers need to be aware that back-up battery power is a finite resource and
should be managed in the same way that food, water, and fuel are managed during disasters.
Consumers should understand that during a disaster, the VoIP network may be out of service, the
internet network may be out of service, and/or commercial power may be out of service. If the
VoIP or internet network is out of service, the consumer should save their back-up battery power
until both the VoIP and internet networks are back in service. Using back-up battery to power
CPE while the VoIP network or the internet network is out of service will only run down the
back-up battery.
4. Step 3: Post-outage analysis
After a commercial power outage, consumers should analyze the effectiveness of the back-up
battery methods they chose. Consumers should determine what, if any, additional back-up
battery resources should be added. Consumers should understand that the life expectancy of the
back-up battery decreases the more often the back-up battery is used.

All consumers face commercial power interruptions. These interruptions may be from natural or
man-made disasters and could last minutes, hours, days, or weeks depending on the severity of
the interruption. Consumers that rely on VoIP technology must understand the product they
have purchased, the range of battery back-up options commercially available, the need to
conserve back-up battery power, and how to check the back-up battery user guide for a status
indicator.
Before a consumer can plan for a commercial power outage, they have to understand the VoIP
Consumer Premise Equipment (CPE) they are using. In order to prepare for a commercial

Recommendations
1. VoIP Service Provider Notification Recommendations
The consumers of all VoIP service providers will face commercial power interruptions. These
interruptions may be from natural or man-made disasters and could last minutes, hours, days, or
weeks depending on the severity of the interruption.
VoIP service providers, as part of consumer education efforts, should provide a full explanation
of emergency use capabilities, battery back-up units, and how to access detailed information
about battery back-up units through its Company website, in its installation/confirmation of
service materials, and/or as part of a technician’s explanation of the service at the customer’s
premise. VoIP service providers should ensure information is available to all consumers
including persons with disabilities so that consumers are able to fully understand their CPE in
order to maintain critical services.
If VoIP service providers are proactively notifying consumers prior to an anticipated extreme
weather event (outside of normal emergency notification messages), the VoIP service provider
should include detailed information about emergency use capabilities, battery back-up units, or
how to access detailed information about battery back-up units. This consumer outreach can be
achieved through specifically designated storm preparation information, through routinely listed
information on the provider’s website, or other means to ensure reaching all consumers.
As VoIP service providers introduce new technologies and services, they should provide a full
explanation of emergency use capabilities, battery back-up units, and how to access detailed
information about battery back-up units through its Company website, in its
installation/confirmation of service materials, and/or as part of a technicians’ explanation of the
service at the customer’s premise.
VoIP service providers should review and update their communications plans annually.
