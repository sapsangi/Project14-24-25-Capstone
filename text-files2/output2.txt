ECD develops guidance on emergency communications grant programs, oversees the development and implementation of the National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP), establishes criteria for Statewide Communications Interoperability Plans (SCIPs), and develops policy strategies and policy recommendations for the use of land mobile radio (LMR), broadband and other emergency communications technologies by the public safety community. ECD also conducts assessments of the national security and emergency preparedness communications capabilities of federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial public safety agencies. National Emergency Communications Plan The NECP is the nation’s strategic plan to strengthen and enhance emergency communications capabilities. The NECP establishes a shared vision for emergency communications and assists those who plan for, coordinate, invest in, and use operable and interoperable communications for response and recovery operations. This includes traditional emergency responder disciplines and other partners from the whole community that share information during incidents and planned events. NECP Resources Implementing the NECP Webinar Series Emergency Communications Grants Policies and Programs ECD supports the coordination of grant guidance across the federal government through development of the SAFECOM Guidance on Emergency Communications Grants and support of the Emergency Communications Preparedness Center Grants Focus Group and SAFECOM/NCSWIC Funding and Sustainment Committee. Interoperable communications encompass a wide range of activities—purchasing new equipment, hosting governance meetings, and conducting training and exercises—that require significant funding. ECD serves as the program office for the Rural Emergency Medical Communications Demonstration Project.
