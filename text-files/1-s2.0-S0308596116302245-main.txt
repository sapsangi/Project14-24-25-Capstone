Policy agendaABSTRACT
This paper investigates the evolution of the telecommunications policy agenda by means of text
mining forty years –from 1976 to 2016 –of papers in the journal Telecommunications Policy . Text
mining techniques help identify the key topics, the dominant combinations of concepts and themain areas of research within this multidisciplinary –technical, economic, social, policy –dis-
cipline. In addition they depict an evolution of the policy agenda more nuanced than the con-
ventional public service, pre-competition and post-liberalisation stages typical oftelecommunications. Also, in combination with bibliometric information, the results display the
relationships between areas of research and methodologies, countries and authors ’background, all
together providing a deeper understanding of the past, present and future avenues for research intelecommunications policy.
1. Introduction
Unlike most academic journals, Telecommunications Policy has two salient features: (1) it was founded with a clear and de ﬁnite aim
that has not changed over the years, and (2) its title accurately re ﬂects this aim. Lawrence H. Day, ﬁrstGeneral Editor ofTele-
communications Policy , wrote on the ﬁrst Editorial comment published on December 1976 ( Day, 1976 ), that the journal will present a
continuing discussion on telecommunications futures and policy options […]in a manner that is most useful to decision makers and policy analysts
in government and industry , whilst acknowledging that a considerable amount of the material published in the journal is expected to come from
academic and national and international policy-research organisations .
The way in which the sought dialogue between academia and stakeholders has developed is twofold. First, decision makers from
here and there have undoubtedly taken advantage of the progresses and ideas published in the journal. Unhappily, the extent and
manner in which this has happened is impossible to elucidate in the framework of this paper. Conversely, policy agendas have oriented,
or even constrained, research agendas and, consequently, the subjects covered in the articles published in the journal.
This on-going link between hot policy and regulatory issues on the one hand, and publications on the other, serves a speci ﬁc purpose.
When reached a certain level of maturity, every discipline looks back to analyse what has been its own evolution. Usually, this requires a
considerable effort of gathering and organising facts and documents, often scattered among a wide array of sources. In the case of

All rights reserved.Telecommunications Policy 41 (2017) 853 –877telecommunications policy –as a discipline –, the existence of the privileged outlet that is Telecommunications Policy –as a journal –brings
a substantial simpli ﬁcation of this task. Without obviously denying that many interesting works can be found elsewhere, Tele-
communications Policy has held –and holds –the lead position as the reference in the sector. What has happened in telecom-related
markets has had a re ﬂection on the pages of the journal; what has been discussed in the articles that have deserved publication has
frequently arrived to the of ﬁces of regulatory authorities and decision makers.
With this in mind, this article intends to make a review of the evolution of the agenda of the telecommunications sector –this is,
which are the most relevant items in this agenda and how they have evolved over time –, looking at it through the glasses of the articles
published in Telecommunications Policy . For that, a number of techniques from multivariate (big) data analysis speci ﬁcally aimed at text
mining have been employed. The aim when making use of these methods is twofold: these are the most adequate tools to identify
prominent items in a set of text documents such as journal papers, while, from the perspective of authors, their usage provides an
illustration on the possibilities of textual analysis in the domain of ICT research, an increasingly popular methodology across many
industries and research ﬁelds but seldom applied in the ICT domain. In addition to the text mining analysis, but always departing from it,
bibliometric information has been added to explore the links between main dimensions of research –main topics in the policy agenda –
and other variables such as methodological approach or geographical distribution.
The article is structured as follows: after this introduction, the next section brie ﬂy discusses the links between academic publications
and policy-making to put in context the ﬁndings of this paper. Next, the section on methodology explains the collection of data, the pre-
processing, the text mining techniques and the software employed. The ensuing section presents and discusses the results with a par-
ticular focus on cluster analysis. Last, the conclusions section closes the article.
2. The role of academic journals outside the academic world
The usefulness of scholarly journals is always measured in academic terms. Journal rankings and ratings serve as criteria for
evaluating journals performance. Without denying the importance of those indicators, they do not re ﬂect the wider impact that they may
have. Scienti ﬁc research has no sense by itself but understood as an effort to help society progress.
How to assess an impact that transcends academic journals ’foremost playing ﬁeldis a pending challenge –an extraordinarily
daunting challenge, indeed. For those journals in the technological ﬁelds, their signi ﬁcance could be measured by tracing the transfer of
knowledge derived from academic articles to marketable products. For instance, a ranking system that considers the number of citations
in patents as a proxy for measuring the technological value of journals has been proposed ( Liaw, Chan, Fan, &Chiang, 2014 ). For other
kinds of journals, and particularly for policy journals, it is hardly to be expected that such a similar ranking would be available.
However, this does not mean that there is no re ﬂection on how to best use –in real-world conditions –the knowledge enclosed in
scholarly works with policy implications. Almost as old as Telecommunications Policy are two contributions that even today continue to
underpin any further work. The “two-communities theory ”(Caplan, 1979 ), which has largely dominated the ensuing debate, claims that
the problem of under/non-utilization of research in the policy process lies on the fact that policy makers and academics form two
separate and poorly connected communities that operate under different rules, speak different languages, and are motivated by different
rewards systems. With a more positive approach, the “enlightenment function of social research ”(Weiss, 1977 ) states that decision
makers tend to use research indirectly, as “a source of ideas, information, and orientation to the world ( …) although the process is not
easily discernible, over time it may have profound effects on policy ”.
Over the last 40 years, further contributions have ﬁne-tuned but not replaced these theories. There is a number of sensible middle
way approaches that have nuanced the more extreme positions. As a summary, it can be stated that there is not a simple dichotomy
between use and non-use of research by decision makers; rather, the relationship occurs along a spectrum of interaction, with some
public servants engaging more closely with academic research than others ( Newman, Cherney, &Head, 2016 ).
In spite of all the endeavours towards gaining a deeper understanding of how this interaction takes place, the overall evidence is
somehow discouraging: “apart from some biographical accounts and case studies, surprisingly little is known at a more general level
about how policy-makers do actually engage with academic research and expertise ”(Talbot &Talbot, 2015 ). The conclusion, therefore,
is that, in the particular case of Telecommunications Policy , it has in ﬂuenced, no doubt, telecommunications policy, though in ways that it
is impossible to determine or measure.
But equally evident is that telecommunications policy has in ﬂuenced Telecommunications Policy . This reverse link between policy
activity and academic research has never been explored before. Although may not always be as appealing as the direct relationship is, it
is instrumental in raising some other issues, the most outstanding of these being the analysis of the historical evolution of a particular
ﬁeld.
This is the case for this journal and this area of knowledge. The ﬁling in 1974 by the United States Department of Justice of an
antitrust lawsuit against AT &T can be considered the milestone that marks the start of the modern era of telecommunications policy.
Telecommunications Policy witnessed the settlement of this long process, as well as any other landmark event that had happened since
then. In its pages, current affairs at the time have been dissected, analysed, discussed and challenged; issues that were going to play a key
role even in the long term have been foreseen before reaching the market; authors have drawn up proposals and offered recom-
mendations. Academic or practitioner, anyone who had had anything to say has sent his/her work in the ﬁrst place to Tele-
communications Policy . To untangle the lines of the past of Telecommunications Policy is to understand the history and agenda of
telecommunications policy.J.L. G /C19omez-Barroso et al. Telecommunications Policy 41 (2017) 853 –877
8543. Methodology
An active area of research for more than two decades now, text mining –or text analytics –is a broad umbrella term describing a range
of technologies for analysing and processing semi-structured and unstructured text data. In a manner analogous to data mining, text
mining seeks to extract useful information from data sources through the identi ﬁcation and exploration of interesting regularities,
patterns, trends or associations. In the case of text mining, however, the data sources are natural language document collections, and
interesting patterns are found not among formalized database records but in the unstructured textual data in the documents in these
collections ( Feldman &Sanger, 2007 ). Inspired by data mining, text mining relies on pre-processing routines, pattern-discovery algo-
rithms, pattern classi ﬁcation and presentation-layer elements such as visualization tools ( Weiss, Indurkhya, Zhang, &Damerau, 2005 ).
Text mining can comprise a number of interrelated objectives: search and information retrieval, document clustering, document
classi ﬁcation, information extraction, natural language processing and concept extraction. Among them, this article focuses on clus-
tering –ﬁnding papers related to each other –, classi ﬁcation –which are the basis for arranging similar papers in a speci ﬁc category –, and
concept extraction –the telecom agenda.
3.1. Text gathering
This paper analyses the information published in the journal Telecommunications Policy since its initial number published in
December 1976 until the last available issue at the time of drafting the present work (June 2016). There are 272 issues in the lot,
comprising a total number of 2,216 papers. From these only 2,121 have been examined, leaving out 76 editorials and 19 notes that have
not enough information for data analysis. This is, using text mining terminology, the “corpus ”of documents for analysis.
The average page length of papers is 11.8 (median 12 and mode 11) with a standard deviation of 5.95. Exhibit 1 shows the annual
distribution of papers where four main periods can be distinguished: (i) a relatively ﬂat number of papers from 1976 to 1991; (ii) an
increase in the count of papers from 1992 to 1998; (iii) again a relatively ﬂat and reduced ﬁgure from 1999 to 2007; (iv) an increasing
trend in the number of papers from 2008 to 2016 with an absolute peak in 2014.
For each paper, title, abstract, keywords, background af ﬁliation and country of authors, and number of citations were collected. Full
text was not considered for two main reasons: it is assumed that the abstract is a good representation of the main contents of the paper,
and full text examination would have taken too much time and resources not providing a different illustration on how these data analysis
techniques can be used in the ICT research domain.
3.2. Text pre-processing
Before conducting the analysis, the paper followed the usual work ﬂow for text mining. First, all the words are converted to lower
case; then, non-letter characters as well as common English stop-words are deleted. After this initial stage, the corpus of text is ready to
be tokenized and passed on to the next stage, which is called stemming. The basic stemming process consists of reducing and/or
grouping words (such as the plural form of nouns) usually by deleting characters until a common root is found. These tasks have been
made with the Porter stemmer in its newest version (Snowball).
Next step in the pre-processing is merging the three different text ﬁelds: title, abstract and keywords. Although there are authors who
prefer to avoid keywords ( Delen&Crossland, 2008 ), or even titles ( Miner et al., 2012 ), with the argument of the possibility of intro-
ducing bias because they may be the terms the authors would like to associate their document to and not the real descriptors of the
article, this article has preferred to equally weight and combine the three text ﬁelds assuming that most authors –with the help of a high-
quality review process such as Telecommunications Policy ’s–will describe correctly the article in both their title and keywords, and that
this combination will be a better weighting of key terms that other possible approaches.1

1According to Ramampiaro and Li (2011) , boosting title, abstract or speci ﬁc sentences or terms can improve the quality of text mining results. In particular, they
suggest weighting the title ﬁeld twice as much as the abstract. There are more sophisticated approaches that weight sentences by the number of keywords, and title
words they contain, or even the position of the paragraph containing the sentence in a segment, and the position of the sentence in the containing parag raph ( Tseng,
2007 ).J.L. G /C19omez-Barroso et al. Telecommunications Policy 41 (2017) 853 –877
855The overall result is 6,348 root terms, reduced to 4,333 after pruning out verbs, adjectives and adverbs.
3.3. Data analysis
Theﬁrst step in the text mining work ﬂow is building the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf). This is a statistic to
measure the relevance of a word in a document from a corpus. It increases with the frequency of apparition of a word in the document
but it is corrected by the frequency of the word in the whole corpus, thus allowing for the fact that some words are more frequent in
general but not necessarily so signi ﬁcant.
Next, the paper has opted for an exploratory factor analysis with the objective of ﬁnding underlying patterns and relationships
between concepts in the text, and as a ﬁrst attempt to condense the information available in the corpus of papers in a smaller set of key
factors. The result of this part of the analysis is a set of words highly interrelated, known as factors, components or dimensions, which are
assumed to represent conceptual relationships. In the case of text mining, singular value decomposition (SVD) is the recommended
practical technique to extract these conceptual relationships due to the sparse nature of the matrix of documents vs. terms ( Miner et al.,
2012 ). SVD is commonly used in statistical natural language processing to identify “latent dimensions of meaning ”that organize the
documents in the corpus. The information grouped this way contains all the original information but in less variables. Thus, it is a form
of feature extraction, eliminating the usual redundancies in a text. Technically SVD transforms a high-dimensional matrix ( “space ”)o f
documents by terms into a much lower dimensional space of dimensions de ﬁned as linear combinations of row or column values, which
extract the most important information from the original matrix.
SVD is a usual ﬁrst step in the direction of identifying clusters of terms, that is, words that usually go together, which is precisely the
next stage in the text mining process followed in this article. Through cluster analysis, terms are grouped into sets or categories so that
words belonging to the same cluster are more similar/related to one another than they are to terms in other clusters ( Hair, Black, Babin,
&Anderson, 2010 ). Cluster analysis is used with two main objectives: the formation of a taxonomy of papers –an empirical based
classi ﬁcation of terms –, and the discovery of relationships between the terms that are not possible at individual word level. It is
important to note that while SVD shares the second objective, the ﬁrst is speci ﬁc of cluster analysis, thus allowing to include each paper
in one particular thematic cluster.
Measuring term similarity is the fundamental element of cluster analysis within text mining. Although it is widely acknowledged that
the cosine distance performs better than the Euclidean distance for text data ( Pons-Porrata, Berlanga-Llavori, &Ruiz-Shulcloper, 2007 ),
the latter was selected as measure of similarity since both are equivalent for text vectors of normalized length –which is the case as only
title, abstract and keywords are used. Once the measure of similarity is speci ﬁed, the next step is the classi ﬁcation of the corpus into
different categories. There are several clustering algorithms that provide this function. The paper has used k-means as clustering
algorithm since the size of the data set avoids the use of hierarchical methods. This algorithm works by portioning the data into a user-
speciﬁed number of clusters and then iteratively reassigning terms to cluster until the distance between terms within a cluster is
minimized and distance between clusters is maximized ( Hair et al., 2010 ). To compensate for the aprioristic user-speci ﬁcation of the
number of clusters a full range of them has been explored together with some measures on the optimum number of clusters, in particular
the x-means algorithm ( Pelleg&Moore, 2000 ) and the Davies-Bouldin index ( Kov/C19acs, Leg /C19any,&Babos, 2005 ). The x-means algorithm is
an extension of the classic k-means algorithm that ﬁnds automatically the optimal number of clusters; it proceeds recursively by running
k-means for a given k and deciding whether to split or not each of the k clusters according to Bayesian information criterion. The Davies-
Bouldin index measures the average of similarity between each possible cluster and its most similar one. As the clusters have to becompact and separated, the lower Davies –Bouldin index means better cluster con ﬁguration.

8573.4. Complementary techniques
To complete the pure text mining procedure explained above, the paper conducts a number of additional analyses.
Theﬁrst of them consists of studying the research methodology used in the paper. For this we have downloaded the full text2of 300
papers –about 14% of the total number of papers for analysis –and manually classify them as qualitative or quantitative. We have used this
to train a support vector machine (SVM) learner algorithm ( Chih-Chung &Chih-Jen, 2011 ) that was able to correctly assign 77% of papers.
The second complementary analysis uses bibliometric techniques after compiling the af ﬁliation information of authors. Unlike
typical bibliometric studies, which are based in simple statistical analysis of bibliometric parameters, –viz., number of publications,
citations, types of article, authors af ﬁliation, etc; for a review in Information Science, see Nagarkar and Kumbhar (2015) –, bibliometric
information is added to the results of the text mining analysis in order to give these results a wider scope.
3.5. Software
Rapidminer was chosen as the software to carry out most of the analysis because of its ease of use yet powerful and modular
approach. Rapidminer is written in Java and uses XML con ﬁguration ﬁles that are easy to exchange and parse. It has a very intuitive
graphical interface and its learning curve allows someone not used to programming languages to extract valuable information almost
immediately. Besides, it can be extended and connected to more advanced languages or platforms like R or Python. It is also free
software in its “community ”edition. Rapidminer was complemented with other statistical, scienti ﬁc and visualization software, such as
Gephi, Octave, PAWS and Statistica.Table 1

8584. Results and discussion
4.1. Preliminary analysis
The most basic analysis is word relative frequency. Filtering out verbs and other non-relevant terms and consolidating similar terms
with the help of the stemmer, Exhibit 2 shows which are the most frequent words in article titles, abstracts and keywords. As expected,
“telecommunications ”is the most frequent word appearing in more than half of the papers and “policy ”ranks number 3, with “services ”
placed in between. The ranking of other relevant topics is “development ”at no. 4, “regulation ”at no. 5, “market ”at no. 9, and
“competition ”at no. 10. They are followed by “access ”at no. 19, “govern ”at no. 22, “social ”at no. 28, and “universal ”at no. 44. On the
technology side, “telephony ”is placed at no. 12 proving the weight of historical relevance, “mobile ”at no. 15, “internet ”at no. 18,
“broadband ”at no. 23, “spectrum ”at no. 30, “standards ”at no. 31, “satellite ”at no. 32, “television ”at no. 33, and “cable ”at no. 42.
From a regional perspective, “Europe ”appears at no. 24, “USA”at no. 43 and China at no. 51.
The same analysis has been conducted in periods of ﬁve years, see Exhibit 11 in the Annex . The most interesting differences with the
overall picture are highlighted in the following:
In 1976 –1980, “computer ”was no. 7 while “social ”was no. 10.
In 1981 –1985 “social ”is yet down at no. 24, but “development ”was no. 2, and legacy technologies acquired a bigger role from the
previous period: “satellite ”at no. 8, “telephony ”at no. 9, “television ”at no. 11, “computer ”at no. 14, and “cable ”at no. 18.
The evolution of the domain is fast and in 1986 –1990 these technologies were losing some positions –but still in the top 20 –with
“telephony ”at no. 14 and “satellite ”at no. 15. Interestingly in this period there is also “competition ”at no. 16, “Europe ”at no. 17, “UK”
at no. 18 and “USA”at no. 20 signalling the shake-up of markets about to come.
In 1991 –1995 this change is more mature and “competition ”is at no. 4, “regulation ”at no. 7 and “market ”at no. 8, whileTable 3

859“telephony ”is still at no. 9.
In 1996 –2000 this is even more pronounced with “regulation ”at no. 4, “competition ”at no. 5 and “market ”at no. 6, while at the
same time “telephony ”is again no. 9; “internet ”appears for the ﬁrst time at no. 15.
In 2001 –2005 “regulation ”and“competition ”are in the top-10, “internet ”has gone up to no. 9, “mobile ”appears for the ﬁrst time in
the top 10 at no. 6 as well as “spectrum ”at no. 14, while “telephony ”is still no. 12 and “development ”is no. 15; also “access ”appears for
theﬁrst time at no. 16.
In 2006 –2010 “mobile ”is no. 3 and “broadband ”enters at no. 10.
Finally in 2011 –2016 we still have “mobile ”at no. 3, “broadband ”at no. 9 and “spectrum ”at no. 20, also “market ”,“regulation ”and
“internet ”make for the top 10, and last but not least “China ”turns up at no. 21.
4.2. Exploratory factor analysis
Applying the SVD technique to the corpus, the ﬁrst practical question is how many dimensions –linear combination of terms –to
retain. A visual criterion called the scree test ﬁnds the dimension from where the smooth decrease of singular values appears to level off
to the right of the plot. According to this criterion the paper retains eight dimensions for analysis, in line with practical recommendations
for text mining to keep between ﬁve and 20 dimensions ( Miner et al., 2012 ).
In order to interpret the dimensions and assign some meaning to them, the authors have followed a process consisting of reviewing
the scatterplot of terms against the dimensions, as seen in Exhibit 3 . This is a mostly subjective procedure and as such subject to some
discussion but still useful and frequently employed ( Miner et al., 2012 ). Using this method, ﬁrst dimension varies from what can be
called “market ”–as terms such as service, competition and regulation stand out –to“social ”–where there is rural, government, local and
universal. The second component looks mostly as different “technologies ”from mobile through telephony and broadband –closer to
market –to cable and television. The third component varies from broadband and internet through radio and mobile to spectrum,
therefore could be interpreted as “ﬁxed to mobile ”. The fourth is somewhat more dif ﬁcult to interpret but in authors ’view can be
assumed as issues related –and unrelated –with “standardization ”–where China is particularly relevant. Following a similar logic,
dimension no. 5 can be associated with “spectrum ”issues and dimension no. 6 linked to items where “television / media ”is (un)rel-
evant. Finally, the 7th dimension confronts “universal / rural / telephony / service ”to the rest of concepts, with China and stand-
ardization again relevant, and dimension no. 8 displays “internet ”vs.“satellite ”and related concepts.
These scatterplots provide also useful insights into terms that usually go together. They are a blueprint of clusters of words that are
located close together in the space de ﬁned by the SVD-derived latent dimensions of meaning. Thus, clusters of terms in relatively close
proximity may suggest that the respective terms are associated with similar meaning and underlying dimensions. Main examples of
interest are: “mobile –broadband ”,“internet –price –access ”,“service –network ”,“competition –market –country ”,“tele-
communication –policy –development –regulation ”, “ict–china –standard ”, “investment –local –infrastructure ”, and
“allocation –licence –radio –spectrum –auction ”.
Next the paper examined SVD in each period of ﬁve years. This was just conducted for the ﬁrst four components for simplicity and
only the most interesting results in the view of authors are highlighted. The results are summarized in Table 1 . Looking at the ﬁrst–and
main in terms of explanatory power –dimension, the themes have moved from a pre-convergent dichotomy between telecoms and
computing, initially to television and then to (de)regulation introducing at sequential stages competition, market and access, with two
separate times –2001 to 2005 and 2011 to 2016 –where mobile has been dominant. Interestingly the second dimension has been mostly
related with technology, subsequently advancing from satellite to cable, then to internet and ﬁnally into broadband. The third com-
ponent has also brought topics with a relevant evolution over time: universal service, rural access, and spectrum. Shared between the
third and the fourth dimension, the role of international conferences is underlined in 1981 –1985 and 1986 –1990. Finally the fourth
dimension insists at key periods in the differences between different types of services –1976 to 1980 and 2001 to 2005 –and different
geographic areas –1986 to 1990, 1991 to 1995 –, lately highlighting standardization and broadband.

The next step in the analysis is classifying the corpus into different categories or clusters. Since k-means requires knowing the
number of clusters in advance, and as explained in the methodology section, the paper has followed an ordered approach to elucidate the
appropriate number of clusters. First the x-means algorithm with cosine distance provides a recommended number of four clusters. The
Davies-Bouldin index with Euclidean distance has several minimums at four, seven, eleven, thirteen and eighteen clusters. Using these
ﬁgures on the number of clusters as a departing point, the paper examines the results of the cluster analysis from ﬁve to twelve number of
clusters to select –from authors ’perspective –the most meaningful combinations as explained in the following. This supervised approach
is rather usual in non-hierarchical cluster analysis.3
When the number of clusters selected is ﬁve, authors ’summary interpretation of the themes of the clusters is: “telephony (both ﬁxed
and mobile) ”,“broadband, television, rural, access ”,“standards ”,“spectrum ”and“regulation / competition ”. Moving on to six clusters
adds a new theme on “international telecom ”and separates “broadband, investment, access ”from “television, development ”that now
go together with “standards ”. Here “universal, rural ”belongs to the cluster on “regulation / competition ”. Advancing to seven clusters
brings themes on “development / information society ”and pinpoints “rural ”. In this clustering “regulation ”blends with “television ”.
Eight clusters analysis separates “television ”from “regulation / competition ”and joins “internet ”and “information society ”. Nine
clusters raise a speci ﬁc theme for papers on “European regulation ”and complements “international ”with “development, itu, confer-
ences ”. Ten clusters analysis brings up particular themes on “Asia - China market ”and“satellite ”and a rather general area on “tele-
communications, internet, services ”. Eleven clusters is precisely a combination of all of the themes above, with the addition of separating
“ﬁxed telephony ”from “mobile ”for the ﬁrst time. Finally, twelve clusters analysis extends to a theme on “liberalisation, global trade ”
but at the expense of reintroducing the rather general area on “telecommunications, internet, services ”.
Considering all the above, the eleven-cluster looks as a pertinent summary of the cluster analysis, and therefore, this is the chosen
number of clusters. Table 2 gives a descriptive title to every cluster, and shows the 20 more relevant words in every box. Tables 6 –12in
theAnnex do the same for the other options ( ﬁve to twelve clusters).
The themes that de ﬁne the eleven clusters are all strong candidates for a taxonomy of Telecommunications Policy papers. Exhibit 4
shows the distribution of the Telecommunications Policy papers across this eleven-cluster taxonomy.

3According to Hair et al. (2010) , cluster solutions ultimately require external validation. It is also suggested that the researcher uses several optimization rules for the
number of clusters and look for a consensus cluster solution. It is recommended, for the ﬁnal analysis, to compute a number of different cluster solutions and decide
among them using practical judgement.J.L. G /C19omez-Barroso et al. Telecommunications Policy 41 (2017) 853 –877

862As seen in Exhibit 4 , the category related with “information, policy, technology, development, telecom ”(C8 in Table 2 )h a st h e
highest number of papers, well above the rest. Therefore, a speci ﬁc (sub)cluster analysis on it was carried out. Table 3 presents the
results of the cluster analysis for “info society / development ”. The Davies-Bouldin index suggest three (sub)clusters for this cat-
egory. The ﬁrst subcluster refers to “information, internet, media, social ”(321 papers), the second can be labelled more appro-
priately as “policy, regulation, development ”(528 papers) and the third relates mostly with “regional / rural development ”(76
papers).
Next stage in the analysis is the evolution of the total 13 clusters (10 clusters þ3 subclusters) during the 40-year life span of Tele-
communications Policy .Exhibit 5 displays this evolution, grouped in 5-years periods for simplicity. The graph exposes that some of the
clusters have had a remarkable change along the 1976 –2016 period, in particular: “ﬁxed telephony ”had a maximum in the period
around the liberalisation of telecoms in 1996 –2000; the cluster on “information, internet ”slowly gains weight across the total period
while the contrary happens with the relationship between “policy, regulation, development ”; interestingly “regional / rural develop-
ment ”although more relevant in the ﬁrst period of ﬁve years 1976 –1980, since then has maintained a similar relative relevance in the
total number of papers; the cluster on “standards ”had an early signi ﬁcance during 1981 –1985, in the period where industry was looking
to initial standards such as GSM and then has regained importance in the last three periods since 2001; “spectrum ”is an interesting case
as it comes and goes with peaks in 2001 –2005 and 2011 –2016 in concordance with very active periods for auctions; “satellite ”and

863“conferences / itu ”were key components of Telecommunications Policy papers in the early periods, specially during 1981 –1985, but since
about 2000 they have almost disappeared; “mobile ”appeared in the early 1990s gaining momentum since then with a very high share of
papers in the period 2006 –2010; issues around the triangle “investment, regulation, competition ”have been increasingly central since
the start of the liberalisation stage in the early 1990s; “Asia”as a cluster on particular regulatory schemes has been approximately
constant across the period with a maximum in 1996 –2000; ﬁnally “television ”and“broadband ”have followed opposite paths with the
former decreasing from 2000, precisely when the latter arrived with relevance.
4.4. Complementary analysis
In connection with the previous analysis, the paper carries out a number of complementary investigations. The ﬁrst of them refers to
the type of research methodology used in each of the papers. Two very simple types have been chosen: qualitative vs. quantitative.
Exhibit 6 displays the yearly evolution of both methodologies in the 1976 –2016 period. It is evident the evolution from an ample
majority of qualitative papers in the ﬁrst half of the period, through a phase of slight predominance of quantitative papers to a recent and
approximate balance between the two types.
Next it is the relationship between methodologies and clusters. Exhibit 7 portrays the two methodologies with regard to the 13-
cluster analysis for the whole period 1976 –2016. There are strong relationships between this taxonomy of papers and methodologies
with three main groups: those where qualitative is dominant ( “television ”,“Asia”,“conferences / itu ”,“satellite ”,“standards ”,
“information, internet ”and “policy, regulation, development ”); those where quantitative methodologies lead ( “broadband ”and
“mobile ”); and those where there is a relative balance ( “investment, regulation, competition ”,“spectrum ”,“regional / rural develop-
ment ”and“ﬁxed telephony ”). The paper hypothesizes that there are speci ﬁc connections between methodologies and clusters, but that

865there is also a considerable in ﬂuence of time in the sense of those clusters with an earlier relevance are more prone to use qualitative
techniques while, on the contrary, quantitative methodologies are strongly linked to more “modern ”clusters.
The second complementary analysis looks into the relationship with geographical areas. Authors ’afﬁliation4was used to know the
major countries contributing to Telecommunications Policy research. Table 4 displays the results in terms of published articles and
received citations. As for calculating the number of citations, Scopus database has been used.5Table 4 shows that the USA ranks ﬁrst and
has contributed almost 35 per cent (i.e. 755) of the total 2,190 publications for which af ﬁliation is disclosed; similarly, almost 39 per
cent (7,606) of the total (19,692) citations are received by papers published from USA. In terms of regions, Europe leads with 42 per cent
(i.e. 926 of the total) but with also almost 39 per cent (7,585) of the total citations. It is as well interesting to ﬁnd that in the top ten
countries producing Telecommunications Policy papers, there are two countries from Asia (China and South Korea) with Japan at no. 11.Table 7

5Scopus information “CitedBy ”has been used. It should be noted that ﬁgures previous to 1996 are inaccurate. Citations have been gradually incorporated to
databases, though it is yet an un ﬁnished business. See https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-has-added-5-million-pre-1996-articles-and-over-93-million-references-
and-we-re-not-even [half-way] (November 2015)J.L. G /C19omez-Barroso et al. Telecommunications Policy 41 (2017) 853 –877
866Together, Asian countries have contributed 14.5 per cent of the total literature (318 papers) and they have received about 16 per cent of
the total citations (3,093).
Papers published from USA have received an average of 10.07 citations per paper. Analysis of citations received by papers published
in the top ten countries shows that papers from USA, Korea and Netherlands have received an average of ten or more citations per paper,
although it is the nine papers from Mexico those that receive more citations (27.78 in average).
In a second step, collaborations among countries were checked. Exhibit 8 shows the international collaborations in the Tele-
communications Policy papers.6Darker internal circles indicate collaboration leaders and width of line the strength of collaboration. USA
has the highest collaborations with other countries at 82, followed by the UK at 66, Germany and China at 37, Netherlands at 25, Italy at
24 and then, in the external circle, Spain, Canada, Japan and France at 15 collaborations.
In a third step the relationship between regions and clusters is examined. Exhibit 9 shows papers ’region –Europe, USA/Canada,
LatAm, Asia, Africa, Paci ﬁc–with regard to the 13-cluster analysis for the whole period 1976 –2016. The region USA/Canada isTable 9

867dominant in connection with “ﬁxed telephony ”,“information, internet ”, and most notoriously in the “satellite ”cluster. Europe leads in
“mobile ”,“regional / rural ”and notably in “regulation, competition, investment ”. There is an approximate balance between these two
geographical areas in the clusters related with “broadband ”,“international / itu ”,“policy, regulation, development ”,“spectrum ”,
“standards ”and“television ”. Asia has a remarkable position in –obviously –the“Asia”cluster, but also in “mobile ”,“regional / rural ”,
“spectrum ”,“standards ”and“television ”. Paciﬁc region is noteworthy in “broadband ”,“ﬁxed telephony ”,“regional / rural ”,“regulation
/ competition ”,“spectrum ”and “television ”. In the case of LatAm important clusters are “spectrum ”and “mobile ”followed by
“broadband ”,“ﬁxed telephony ”and“regional / rural ”. Finally, Africa focus lies in “regional / rural ”.
The last of the complementary analysis uses citations to look into how the knowledge enclosed in Telecommunications Policy has been
used –at least within the academic world –and how the relevance of the different clusters in terms of their –at least academic –inﬂuence
has changed over time. To introduce the status of citations, Table 13 in the Annex displays the most cited papers in Telecommunications
Policy in each decade within the period 1976 –2016.
Theﬁrst decade, up to 1985 is dominated by papers discussing the diffusion and relevance of (then) new technologies and services
such as teleconferencing and teletext, together with papers on development and social implications. There is also an early study into
competition in telecommunications.
The second decade, 1986 –95, has been in ﬂuential mostly through papers on the relationship between telecommunications and
economic growth, although there are also relevant papers on the use of information, spectrum auctions and universal service.
The third decade, 1996 –2005, exhibits the maximum absolute value on citations and shifts from supply into demand with
authoritative works on customer satisfaction, mobile phone usage, and Internet connectivity. It is also the decade where mobile and data
–Internet –comes into the forefront along with examinations of an increasingly complex industry that moves from simple value chains
into value networks.
The last decade, 2006 –2016, is probably early to be scrutinized globally in terms of citations but hints at papers in 2006 –2010
dealing with the triangle investment –regulation –competition, as well as mobile services –and applications –, and broadband –and
mobile –rural development.
Ensuing this brief analysis of the status of Telecommunications Policy citations, Exhibit 10 shows the number of citations per cluster in
absolute value and relative to the number of papers in the cluster. “Mobile ”cluster leads both classi ﬁcation, followed by “information,
internet ”and“policy, regulation, development ”in absolute ﬁgures, but by “broadband ”and“standards ”in relative terms.
Next, the evolution of these citations in each of the four decades in the 1976 –2016 period appears in Exhibit 11 . In terms of decades,
works on “policy, regulation, development ”lead the ﬁrst and second decade. Third and fourth decades are commanded by “mobile ”,
with emerging “broadband ”in the latter. From clusters ’perspective, outmoded themes seems to be “satellite ”(which concentrates its
citations in the ﬁrst two decades), “international / itu ”(mainly cited in the second decade), or “television ”. The third and fourth decades
sees a blooming of citations in all themes. The clusters whose impact is most recent, i.e., those who have received the higher share of
citations during the last ten years, are “regulation / competition ”,“regional / rural ”and notoriously “broadband ”.“Standards ”and
“mobile ”have a similar number of citations in the third and fourth decade.
Always classi ﬁed by decades, Table 13 , in the Annex , shows the Telecommunications Policy articles that have received more citations
along the years. Conversely, Table 14 , also in the Annex , shows the documents (articles, books, book chapters, even policy documents)

872agenda from 1976 to 2016 and their evolution in this period as summarized below.
In addition, the results tell about the Telecommunications Policy journal. In fact, from this simple analysis, it is ascertained that
Telecommunications Policy is a well-con ﬁgured journal with regard to its foundational aims, able to combine economy –markets –, law
–regulation –, social theories –policy –and technology in a unique multidisciplinary approach. No keyword from any of these areas seems
to preside over the others and most of them are subordinated to telecommunications. Looking speci ﬁcally into dimensions it seems there
is a broad picture with a basic separation of market and social approaches to distinguish between papers and then technology is merged
to complete each Telecommunications Policy paper investigation into a particular issue.
Regarding the telecommunications policy agenda, and according to the ﬁndings in the paper, it has been dominated by a shortlist of
about ten to ﬁfteen themes that shape overlapping but meaningful subdomains within the extensive area of telecommunications. The
ﬁrst column in Table 5 enumerates the thirteen themes selected in this paper for analysis while the second and third columns compile
keywords and dimensions respectively. The fourth column highlights the most relevant periods for the particular theme, indicating alsoTable 15

inﬂuential geographical area. The seventh column classi ﬁes the themes has high, medium and low number of citations. The eight and
last column uses the Table 16 in the Annex with a compilation of milestones in telecommunications policy to establish whether the
theme was anticipating the policy decision –proactive –or rather discussing its effects and implications –reactive.7
As explained in Section 2 , this compilation of themes helps to explore the reverse link between policy activity and academic research,
and it is instrumental in the analysis of the historical evolution of telecommunications policy.
Conventionally, see G/C19omez-Barroso and Feij /C19oo (2010) for a detailed account from a public-private perspective, there have been three
main stages for telecommunications policy:Table 16

875i) The “monopolistic stage ”, from the beginning of network deployment up to the various crises of the seventies, where tele-
communications were basically a “public matter ”.
ii) The “liberalisation stage ”, from the early 1980s up to the turn of the century, where telecommunications became a matter for
private operators, led by a long-running and “guided ”re-regulation process.
iii) The “information society stage ”, from the early 2000s until now, characterized by mostly open markets, speeding-up of the
technological advances, transnational companies and institutions, economic and geopolitical instability and, especially, a change
of economic paradigm: from an industrial age to an information age.
The analysis in this paper, in authors ’view, allows proposing a more nuanced evolution of the stages for telecommunications policy,
adding characteristic and notes that complete the above agenda. Precisely, the paper suggests the following (sub)stages8:
i.b)9“Late monopolistic stage ”, up to about 1980, where the academic community is concerned with two types of issues that the
conventional approach can not address properly: the social changes that the use of new informational and communication services
and computers could bring, and the limitations of existing policy and regulation for development and underserved areas.
ii.a) “Early liberalisation stage ”, up to about 1985, where it was considered that international conferences, such as ITU, were
appropriate fora to discuss the telecommunications policy agenda and where technologies such as satellite served as instances of
early liberalisation and the fall of pre-existing barriers in the telecommunications ﬁeld. At the same time television in connection
with new services, but also with conferences, satellite and new services was an initial example of convergence and the mutual
inﬂuence between media and telecommunications.
ii.b) “Mid liberalisation stage ”, up to about 1995, where both the topics from previous stages were considered still relevant, but also
emerged new topics around the effects of liberalisation on traditional services such as telephony; the difference across world regions
started to gain weight in the agenda.
ii.c) “Late liberalisation stage ”, up to about 2000, where regional differences in the approach to liberalisation and the effects of
liberalisation on conventional services such as telephony take central stage accompanied by a renewed interest in –now digital –
television and the implications of Internet deployment and usage.
iii.a) “Early information society stage ”, up to about 2005, where expectations were laid in spectrum auctions, the promises of new
generations of mobile communications, conventional broadband and the effects of standardization in the industry, all with a major
supply-side perspective.
iii.b) “Mid information society stage ”, up to about 2010, where the very dominant themes are the triangle regulation –investment –
competition, mobile and broadband.
iii.c) “Late information society stage ”, up to present, where the focus is on regional / rural development and standardization, in
combination with –supported from –mobile, broadband, spectrum, regulation –investment –competition and Internet themes, and
where the themes on demand, usage and consumers are increasingly central.
All in all, the analysis presented in this paper is an evident simpli ﬁcation of the complex reality portrayed in 40 years of papers of
Telecommunications Policy . However unpretentious, it sheds some light on both the main themes in the last 40 years of tele-
communications policy and how they have evolved from 1976 to the present. And, maybe more relevant, the analysis draws a vibrant
ﬁeld for research, multidisciplinary and encompassing by nature, able to adapt –and even anticipate –the changing policy priorities and
hopefully in ﬂuence them for more informed and better decisions, still the valid foundational aim of the area.
