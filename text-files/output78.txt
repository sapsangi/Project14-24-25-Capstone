1 Executive Summary
Working Group 8 of the Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council
(CSRIC) addressed the area of Internet Service Provider (ISP) Network Protection, with a focus
on addressing “bots” and “botnets”, which are serious and growing problems for end-users and
ISP networks. Botnets are formed by maliciously infecting end-user computers and other
devices with bot (from the word “robot”) software through a variety of means, and
surreptitiously controlling the devices remotely to transmit onto the Internet spam and other
attacks (targeting both end-users and the network itself).
The Working Group examined potentially relevant existing Best Practices (BPs), and in
consultation with industry and other experts in the field, identified additional Best Practices to
address this growing problem.
The Working Group identified 24 Best Practices to address protection for end-users as well as
the network. The Best Practices, set out in Appendix A, are organized into the logical steps
required to address botnets. The first step is Prevention (12 BPs), followed by Detection (5
BPs), Notification (2 BPs), and then Mitigation (3 BPs). In addition, 2 BPs on Privacy
Considerations were identified to address the handling of customer information in botnet
response. The BPs identified are primarily for use by ISPs that provide service to consumer
end-users on residential broadband networks but may apply to other end-users and networks as
well.
Industry participants are encouraged to have their respective subject matter experts review these
Best Practices for applicability. It is critical to note that Best Practices in general are not
applicable in every situation because of multiple factors, and such a caveat applies to the work
product of the Working Group. Therefore, the Best Practices set out below are intended to be
voluntary in nature for ISPs, and may not apply in all contexts (and thus for a host of reasons
should not be made mandatory). With this understanding, the Working Group recommends that
the Best Practices be implemented by ISPs, where applicable, in order to address the growing
botnet problem in consumer end-user devices and ISP networks.
2 Introduction
The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (“CSRIC) is a Federal
Advisory Committee that provides input and recommendations to the Federal Communications
Commission (“FCC”) regarding the security, reliability and resiliency of communications
systems, including telecommunications, media and public safety communications systems. On
March 19, 2009, the FCC, pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, renewed the charter
for the CSRIC for a period of two years, through March 18, 2011. The FCC commenced its first
set of CSRIC meetings in December, 2009.
CSRIC created ten working groups, each with its own area of responsibility. As a result,
Working Group 8 was charged with producing a report regarding ISP Network Protection
Practices with a focus on botnets, a significant and growing problem in ISP cybersecurity.
Working Group 8 began bi-weekly discussions on March 8, 2010. The group members
represent a wide range of expertise in network protection and consumer use of computers. (See
Page 4 of 31The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group [8]
November, 2011
Draft Report
Section 2.2.) In addition to the bi-weekly calls, the group met face to face twice in Washington,
DC. The Working Group’s scope of effort is described in Section 3.
After efforts to scope the problem, the Working Group turned to other industry experts to
evaluate the current situation with respect to network protection and infected computers. The
Working Group heard from representatives of Neustar, the Spamhaus Project, Damballa,
Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG) and the National Cyber Security Alliance.
The information garnered from these experts formed the basis for many of the Best Practices
identified by the Working Group.
The Working Group further refined its scope in order to address the botnet problem effectively.
As the Working Group identified areas to address, it recognized that the most pressing area of
the botnet problem lies in consumer-focused residential broadband networks. Although botnets
are also a concern with business-focused networks and service, the business arrangements in that
context are far more diverse than in the residential consumer market, and there is already more
activity in the business context in response to botnets. Our focus for this Report is thus on
identifying Best Practices for ISPs that provide services to consumers on residential broadband
networks.
Notwithstanding this focus, many of the Best Practices identified here would also be valuable
practices to apply in non-consumer, non-residential network contexts. The Working Group
recommends that, at a later date, the FCC consider whether additional best practice work would
be valuable in these areas.
The Best Practices suggested in this Report reflect the consensus of Working Group 8 as to
measures that ISPs should voluntarily undertake to address the botnet problem on residential
broadband networks. The Working Group specifically did not undertake to make any
recommendations of any measures for which it should be mandated that service providers
implement. In light of the complexity and diversity of individual networks, and the fast-
changing nature of the botnet security threats, individual networks should be able to respond to
security threats in the manner most appropriate for their own network.
The Best Practices should not be viewed as an exhaustive list of all steps that ISPs could take to
address botnets and compromised computers. Indeed, many service providers take additional
steps in response to the botnet problem, and many are often assessing what new or additional
techniques should be considered – beyond the foundational measures suggested below.
As noted, the Best Practices identified below reflect the consensus of Working Group 8, arrived
at through a collaborative process of discussion and refinement. The background and overview
of the botnet problem and the Working Group’s process and discussions were prepared primarily
by the Working Group co-chairs in consultation with the Working Group members, but may not
reflect in all details the consensus of all members of the group.

3 Objective, Scope, and Methodology
3.1 Objective
This document addresses the objective and deliverables outlined in the charter for Working
Group 8, as defined by the full CSRIC:
Working Group 8 has investigated current practices that ISPs use to protect their
networks from harms caused by the logical connection of computer equipment, as well
as desired practices and associated implementation obstacles2. These efforts address
techniques for dynamically identifying computer equipment that is engaging in a
malicious cyber attack, notifying the user, and remediating the problem. The Working
Group has developed recommendations for CSRIC’s consideration for best practices and
actions the FCC could take that may help overcome implementation obstacles.
The Working Group focused its efforts on the relationship between ISPs and end users in the
residential broadband context. The Working Group worked to understand the problem of
botnet–compromised, end-user devices and identify Best Practices for ISPs that are effective in
addressing end-user device compromise.
3.2 Scope
This section details the problem statement, working group description and deliverables outlined
in the CSRIC charter for Working Group 8:
Problem Statement: Security flaws in the hardware and/or software used by
consumers coupled with poor or non-existent system administration practices by end-users have
resulted in an epidemic of compromised computers, many of which can be remotely controlled
as a part of what are frequently called ‘botnets’. Once compromised, the owners of these
computers are put at risk as their personal information and communications can be monitored,
1 Robert Thornberry of Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, and Paul Diamond of Qwest served as the lead editors of the Best
Practices themselves, and the Working Group Co-chairs appreciate the significant time, effort, and patience that this
entailed. The Working Group Co-chairs would also like to thank Katherine O’Hara of Verizon for her invaluable
efforts in helping this Group operate efficiently, and in the preparation of this Report.

As used here “computer equipment” includes a wide variety of personal equipment (e.g., servers, PCs, smart
phones, home routers, etc.) as well as household devices with embedded IP network connectivity. “logical
connection” refers to end-user data communications protocol signaling and transmission. Harms result from the
ability to degrade the communications infrastructure though malicious protocol exchanges and information
transmission.

and their computing power and Internet access can be exploited by those controlling the botnet.
Armies of these compromised computers can also be used together to disseminate spam, store
and transfer illegal content, and to attack the servers of government and private entities
with massive, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
Working Group Description: This Working Group will investigate current practices that ISPs
use to protect their networks from harms caused by the logical connection of computer
equipment as well as desired practices and associated implementation obstacles. The work
should address techniques for dynamically identifying computer equipment that is engaging in a
malicious cyber attack, notifying the user, and remediating the problem. The working Group
will develop proposed recommendations for CSRIC's consideration for best practices and
actions the FCC could take that may help overcome implementation obstacles.
Deliverables:
1. Capture Best Practices that address ISP end-user device botnet compromise and
mitigate the potential network impact on ISPs.
2. Investigate and assess the impact on privacy concerns related to botnet
compromises and recommend best practices addressing these issues.
3. Develop a reference list that provides additional information related to these
issues.
4. Recommend further work to address the botnet issues.
3.3 Methodology
3.3.1 Methodology Overview3
Working Group 8 began its investigation by conducting research into the state of botnets, the
extent of compromised devices and the effects on end-users and the network. The Working
Group evaluated existing Best Practices for relevance and incorporated those that were
determined to be effective and implementable. New Best Practices were created as needed,
based on the information provided to the Working Group from industry experts (including
members of the Working Group itself).
The Best Practices identified by the Working Group target ISPs that provide services to
consumers on residential broadband networks. Many of the Best Practices suggested here,
however, would also be valuable practices to follow in non-consumer, non-residential contexts.
The Working Group recommends that, at a later date, the FCC consider whether additional best
practice work is would be valuable in these areas.
3.3.1.1 Research
The Working Group research included consultation with industry experts. The Working Group
invited representatives from Neustar, the Spamhaus Project, Damballa, Messaging Anti-Abuse
Working Group and the National Cyber Security Alliance to present their findings,
recommendations and insights into botnet prevention, detection, notification and mitigation.
3
The Working Group heard from Mr. Karl F. Rauscher, NRIC Steering Committee Member and Best Practice
Contributor, on using NRIC Best Practices as a model for developing CSRIC WG 8 Best Practices.
Page 8 of 31The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group [8]
November, 2011
Draft Report
In addition to hearing from industry experts, the Working Group tapped expertise from within.
For example, representatives from Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email (CAUCE)
provided insight into Best Practices. The Working Group also reviewed on-going research and
documents developed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to expand the group’s
understanding of the scope and breadth of botnets affecting end-users.
Based on the research conducted by Working Group 8, the following is a summary of findings
from expert presentations and consultations:
• Botnet compromise of end-user devices is a significant problem that affects all ISPs -
large and small.
• Botnet malware is rapidly proliferating into end-user devices.
• A rapid increase in botnet infections and technological sophistication appears to have
been driven by the funding of botnet technology by sophisticated criminal elements.
• Botnet malware technology, infections, and the resulting impacts resulting from
them are moving faster than ISP industry methods and technologies have, to date,
been able to respond.
• Botnets are a complex issue involving both end-user and network issues.
• ISP efforts to address botnets must include cooperation and information sharing
among ISPs in order to fully address the problem.
• There are existing Best Practices (including some IETF RFCs) that address certain
aspects of botnets (e.g., concerning responses to spam), but no comprehensive
approach has been identified or widely implemented in United States networks.
• Botnet detection methods raise issues of end-user privacy which need to be
considered when developing approaches to the botnet problem.
• The problem of botnets in end-user devices can be substantially improved by
implementation of the Best Practices identified by the Working Group, as applicable,
by ISPs serving consumers on residential broadband networks.
3.3.1.2 Next Steps
The initial work of Working Group 8 sets a foundation for ISPs to address bots in end-user
devices on residential broadband networks, helping to reduce the impact of botnet attacks on the
network. Because of the immense scope of the issue, we have just scratched the surface.
Possible next steps in dealing with bots and botnets could be to widen the scope of this work to
include attack vectors which exploit network vulnerabilities to propagate bots and provide for
obfuscation of botnet Command and Control channels. Although we touched on this area with
our initial work in DNS, dynamic space, and spam, this work could be expanded to include
improved protection from social engineering vulnerabilities, the infection of public web sites
with bot-related Trojans and other malware, and further work on the network detection and
isolation of bot Command and Control traffic. Work in some of these areas may fall outside te
scope of CSRIC or the reach of the FCC, but could be pursued in other voluntary industry and
multi-stakeholder fora.
As mentioned in the Recommendations section, these Best Practices should be reviewed
frequently and updated to reflect the latest technology and methods in dealing with botnets. In
addition, the Working Group recommends that, at a later date, the FCC consider whether
additional best practice work would be valuable in network-focused areas beyond the residential
broadband networks that formed the focus of this Report.

3.3.1.3 Creation of New Best Practices
In the work to create new ISP Best practices, we reviewed current NRIC Best Practices to
identify any existing Best Practices that applied to our charter and to determine if these Best
Practices needed modification or updating. Although we found two that referred to bots, they
were focused on network issues that were out of our scope for this Working Group.
As new Best Practices were identified and created, the Working Group categorized the Best
Practices in terms of the logical steps required to address botnets. The Best Practice categories
identified by the Working Group include Prevention, Detection, and Notification of end-users,
Mitigation, and Privacy Considerations in detecting bots and notifying end-users. The Best
Practices are set out in Appendix A.
3.3.1.3.1 Prevention Best Practices
The twelve Prevention Best Practices are aimed at preventing botnet infections in end-user
devices and major impacts to ISP networks. For end-users, the main focus is on how ISPs can
help residential broadband end-users prevent bot malware infections from occurring in their
devices and networks. This is accomplished by identifying Best Practices for end-user
awareness and education of the importance of good Internet hygiene, e.g., keeping operating
systems and applications up to date, being aware of social engineering scams, etc., and the use
of anti-virus software to aid in malware and bot detection. ISP personnel need to keep abreast
of the latest botnet technology and malware in order to effectively address botnet issues.
Network prevention Best Practices address bot exploits of the Domain Name System, dynamic
address space, and the prevention of bot-originated spam (which helps to spread bots and other
malware and create network congestion.)
3.3.1.3.2 Detection Best Practices
The five Detection Best Practices are aimed at providing effective ISP bot detection capabilities
and sharing information among ISPs. Because of the increasing sophistication of botnets and the
rapidly changing technologies being utilized in botnets, maintaining effective detection methods
and sharing of information are critical to addressing botnet deployments. Also, the need for
utilizing non-interfering detection methods and timely execution are also addressed.
3.3.1.3.3 Notification Best Practices
Once a bot infection is detected, the end-user needs to be notified so that mitigation action can
be taken. The two Notification Best Practices are aimed at maintaining effective notification
methods and ensuring that critical service information is conveyed to end-users who likely have
a bot infection on their device or network. We suggest that a good balance be struck between
the certainty of the detection and the speed of notification.
3.3.1.3.4 Mitigation Best Practices
Three Mitigation Best Practices are aimed at mitigating bots on end-user devices and the
protection of end-users and the network from botnet attacks. Mitigation Best Practices address
the need for the ISP to notify end-users by providing information on how to address a likely bot
infection. Best Practices are also identified for ISP cooperation in the face of critical cyber
incidents that can be caused by a botnet attack, as well as the potential need for the temporary
Page 10 of 31The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group [8]
November, 2011
Draft Report
isolation of actively attacking bots to reduce the possibility of adverse end-user or network
impact (recognizing that such action should only be used as a “last resort” or in other critical
circumstances, and that any use should be sensitive to the needs of the affected users).
3.3.1.3.5 Privacy Considerations Best Practices
Some of the Prevention, Detection, Notification, and Mitigation Best Practices raise the
recurring issue of protecting end-user information. To address these concerns, the Working
Group developed two Best Practices focused on end-user privacy issues. The first deals with
respecting consumers’ privacy with regard to exposed customer information in addressing bot
infections and attacks and the second suggests a multi-pronged strategy in designing technical
measures that protect the privacy of customer information.
4 Analysis, Findings and Recommendations
4.1 Analysis
The Working Group defined Best Practices in terms of the logical steps required to address
botnets. Prevention Best Practices are those aimed at preventing botnet infections and the
impact on ISP networks. Detection Best Practices are aimed at ISP detection of botnet
infections and attacks. Notification Best Practices are targeted at notifying end-users of possible
botnet infections. Mitigation Best Practices are aimed at mitigating end-user device botnet
infections and the network impact.
4.2 Findings
Our investigation into botnet infections and attacks revealed a real and growing threat to both
ISP end-users and ISP networks. We determined that botnets represent a rapidly shifting
malware landscape of infection, command and control, and attack capability fueled primarily by
the desire for economic gains by those who develop and deploy these botnets – often
sophisticated criminals. We found that weaknesses in end-user devices as well as a lack of
understanding and thus protective reactions by end-users themselves were largely responsible
for the massive infections caused by sophisticated malware infection vectors.
Once infected with malware, botnets are formed when bot malware is activated on the infected
device. The bot then establishes a connection with the botnet “command and control” system
and then typically goes dormant to reduce the risk of detection while it awaits attack orders from
the botnet owner. The level of sophistication has grown to the point where bots can often be
updated with new versions of bot malware to add new attack capabilities and obfuscation
techniques.
The botnet is comprised of all the infected bots under a common command and control. The bot
malware itself is sometimes polymorphic, defying signature base detection at the device level.
Use of sophisticated command and control mechanisms, including the use of peer-to-peer
technology, make bot and botnet detection challenging. Command and control mechanisms
exploit weaknesses in the ISP and Internet infrastructure, e.g., DNS, to avoid detection of
command and control traffic and to creatively provide infection vectors to spread the bot
malware.
Once the end-user device becomes part of a botnet, threats exist to both the end-user and the ISP
network. End-user personal information, such as identity, bank accounts, and credit card
Page 11 of 31The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group [8]
November, 2011
Draft Report
information, can be compromised; the ISP network can be exposed to denial of service attacks,
spam, and other network related attacks.
To address these problems, the botnet lifecycle needs to be disrupted and mitigation of device
bot malware needs to be addressed. The initial focus of this group was to look at end-user and
end-user device issues, and some key network weaknesses that support botnet proliferation and
exacerbate the impact of botnets.
Our findings suggest that the problem of botnets can be substantially mitigated by
implementation, as applicable, of the suggested Best Practices in the residential broadband
context. By looking at botnets from the perspective of Prevention, Detection, Notification, and
Mitigation, a comprehensive program can be established which should have a significant impact
on botnets and their impact on end-users and ISP networks. Most botnet control strategies we
examined have some, but not all, elements of the Best Practices.
These findings support the original belief of the Working Group that botnet technology and
deployment have, to date, moved faster than ISP industry methods to address them. One
common theme within the findings is that cooperation with the end-user and other ISPs is
critical in effectively dealing with this issue. There are no silver bullets that can completely
eradicate this problem. Rather a partnership with end-users and other ISPs is required to address
botnets in a comprehensive way.
4.3 Recommendations
The Working Group findings suggest that the rapid growth of botnets in end-user devices has
been faster than the ability to effectively address the problem, hence significant work beyond the
implementation of Best Practices is strongly encouraged. The following recommendations
resulted from the research and Best Practice work of the Group:
• Because of the rapid growth of botnets and the rapidly changing technology, botnet
Best Practices for ISPs should be revisited at least every two years.
• Standard methods for sharing information with end users and among ISPs should be
better defined. This work could be led by the Alliance for Telecommunications
Industry Solutions (ATIS) (http://www.atis.org/) and the U.S. Commerce
Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
(http://www.nist.gov/index.html)
• Protection (and discarding) of customer information that may be collected by ISPs
while addressing botnets is an important issue that warrants continued attention.
• ISP implementation of the botnet Best Practices should be benchmarked to get a
better idea how ISPs are dealing with the botnet problem.
• Additional possible policy actions are:
• The creation, perhaps with government funding, of an anti-botnet website
available to end users to assist in the removal of botnet malware from
their device, similar to the anti-botnet centers created in Germany (see
http://botfrei.de) and Japan (see, https://www.ccc.go.jp/en_ccc/);
• The creation of a CyberSecurity public information campaign that
includes botnet awareness;
• The creation of a Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT)
Information and Resource Center, available to ISPs and end users,
devoted to botnet detection, mitigation, etc.; and
Page 12 of 31The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group [8]
November, 2011
Draft Report
• Improvements in technology for network detection of botnet command
and control and exploitation of traffic could be encouraged through
research at NIST and research grants from Department of Homeland
Security.
5 Conclusions
Working Group 8 identified 24 Best Practices to address bot-infected, end-user devices and the
impact of botnets on end-users and ISP networks. These BPs form a foundation for addressing
this growing problem and are for consideration by ISPs that provide service to consumers on
residential broadband networks. Potential future work identified by the Working Group
includes regularly reviewing these BPs to keep them up-to-date and to potentially expand the
scope of future Best Practice work to identify Best Practices aimed at addressing the spread of
bot malware through the network and detecting and disrupting botnet command and control
traffic.
The new Best Practices are organized in areas of Prevention (12 BPs), Detection (5 BPs),
Notification (2 BPs), and Mitigation (3 BPs). In addition, 2 BPs were identified in the area of
Privacy Considerations concerning customer information in the context of addressing botnets.
Industry participants are strongly encouraged to have their respective subject matter experts
review these Best Practices for applicability. It is critical to note that Best Practices are not
applicable in every situation because of multiple factors. Therefore, these Best Practices are
intended to be voluntary for the ISPs, and that mandating a particular set of practices could
contribute to suboptimal network operation and reliability, or result in other negative
consequences.
With this understanding, Working Group 8 recommends that the Best Practices set out in
Appendix A be implemented, as applicable, by ISPs in order to address the growing botnet
problem in consumer end-user devices and ISP networks.

CSRIC WG 8 BEST PRACTICES
Page 14 of 31The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group [8]

Draft Report
Introduction to Best Practices
Best Practices are statements that describe the industry’s guidance to itself for the best approach
to addressing a concern. They result from unparalleled industry cooperation that engages vast
expertise and considerable resources. The primary objective of Best Practices is to provide
guidance from assembled industry expertise and experience. The implementation of Best
Practices is intended to be voluntary. Decisions of whether or not to implement a specific Best
Practice are intended to be left with the responsible organization (e.g., Service Provider,
Network Operator, or Equipment Supplier). In addition, the applicability of each Best Practice
for a given circumstance depends on many factors that need to be evaluated by individuals with
appropriate experience and expertise in the same area addressed by the Best Practice.
The Best Practices recommended by CSRIC Working Group 8 are intended to give guidance.
Decisions of whether or not to implement a specific Best Practice are intended to be left with the
responsible organization (e.g., Service Provider, Network Operator, or Equipment Supplier).
Mandated implementation of these Best Practices is not consistent with their intent. The
appropriate application of these Best Practices can only be done by individuals with sufficient
knowledge of company specific network infrastructure architecture to understand their
implications. Although the Best Practices are written to be easily understood, their meaning is
often not apparent to those lacking this prerequisite knowledge and experience. Appropriate
application requires understanding of the Best Practice impact on systems, processes,
organizations, networks, subscribers, business operations, complex cost issues and other
considerations. With these important considerations regarding intended use, the industry
stakeholders are concerned that government authorities may inappropriately impose these as
regulations or court orders. Because these Best Practices have been developed as a result of
broad industry cooperation that engages vast expertise and considerable voluntary resources,
such misuse of these Best Practices may jeopardize the industry’s willingness to work together
to provide such guidance in the future.4

6.1.2 BP Number: Prevention 2
ISP Provision of Educational Resources for Computer Hygiene / Safe Computing:
ISPs should provide or support third-party tutorial, educational, and self-help resources for their
customers to educate them on the importance of and help them practice safe computing. ISPs’
users should know to protect end user devices and networks from unauthorized access through
various methods, including, but not limited to:
• Use legitimate security software that protects against viruses and spywares;
• Ensure that any software downloads or purchases are from a legitimate source;
• Use firewalls;
• Configure computer to download critical updates to both the operating system and
installed applications automatically;
• Scan computer regularly for spyware and other potentially unwanted software;
• Keep all applications, application plug-ins, and operating system software current and
updated and use their security features;
• Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments;
• Be careful when downloading programs and viewing Web pages;
• Use instant messaging wisely;
• Use social networking sites safely;

6.1.4 BP Number: Prevention 4
Protect DNS Servers:
ISPs should protect their DNS servers from DNS spoofing attacks and take steps to ensure that
compromised customer systems cannot emit spoofed traffic (and thereby participate in DNS
amplification attacks). Defensive measures include:
(a) managing DNS traffic consistent with industry accepted procedures;
(b) where feasible, limiting access to recursive DNS resolvers to authorized users;
(c) blocking spoofed DNS query traffic at the border of their networks, and
(d) routinely validating the technical configuration of DNS servers by, for example,
utilizing available testing tools that verify proper DNS server technical configuration.
BP Reference/Comments:
Widely accepted DNS traffic management procedures are discussed in the following document:

6.1.5 BP Number: Prevention 5
Utilize DNSSEC:
ISPs should use Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to protect the
DNS. ISPs should consider, at a minimum, the following:
• sign and regularly test the validity of their own DNS zones,
• routinely validate the DNSSEC signatures of other zones;
• employ automated methods to routinely test DNSSEC-signed zones for
DNSSEC signature validity.

6.1.6 BP Number: Prevention 6
Encourage Use of Authenticated SMTP/Restrict Outbound Connections to Port 25:
ISPs should encourage users to submit email via authenticated SMTP on port 587, requiring
Transport Layer Security (TLS) or other appropriate methods to protect the username and
password. In addition, ISPs should restrict or otherwise control inbound and outbound
connections from the network to port 25 (SMTP) of any other network, either uniformly or on a
case by case basis, e.g., to authorized email servers.

6.1.8 BP Number: Prevention 8
Immediately Reject Undeliverable Email:
ISPs should configure their gateway mail servers to immediately reject undeliverable email,
rather than accepting it and generating non-delivery notices (NDNs) later, in order to avoid
sending NDNs to forged addresses.
BP Reference/Comments:
By rejecting undeliverable email, the gateway mail will inform the sending mail server, which
can apply local policy regarding whether or not to notify the message sender of the non-delivery
of the original message.

ISPs should make IPv4 dynamic address space under their control easily identifiable by reverse
DNS pattern, preferably by a right-anchor string with a suffix pattern chosen so that one may say
that all reverse DNS records ending in *.some.text.example.com are those that identify dynamic
space.

DETECTION BEST PRACTICES
6.1.13 BP Number: Detection 1
Communicate Implementation of Situational Awareness and Protective Measures with
Other ISPs:
ISPs should make reasonable efforts to communicate with other operators and security software
providers, by sending and/or receiving abuse reports via manual or automated methods. These
efforts could include information such as implementation of "protective measures" such as
reporting abuse (e.g., spam) via feedback loops (FBLs) using standard message formats such as
Abuse Reporting Format (ARF). Where feasible, ISPs should engage in efforts with other
industry participants and other members of the internet ecosystem toward the goal of
implementing more robust, standardized information sharing in the area of botnet detection
between private sector providers.

6.1.14 BP Number: Detection 2
Maintain Methods to Detect Bot/Malware Infection:
ISPs should maintain methods to detect likely malware infection of customer equipment.
Detection methods will vary widely due to a range of factors. Detection methods, tools, and
processes may include but are not limited to: external feedback, observation of network
conditions and traffic such as bandwidth and/or traffic pattern analysis, signatures, behavior
techniques, and forensic monitoring of customers on a more detailed level.

Draft Report
6.1.15 BP Number: Detection 3
Use Tiered Bot Detection Approach:
ISPs should use a tiered approach to botnet detection that first applies behavioral characteristics
of user traffic (cast a wide net), and then applies more granular techniques (e.g., signature
detection) to traffic flagged as a potential problem.
BP Reference/Comments:
This technique should help minimize the exposure of customer information in detecting bots by
not collecting detailed information until it is reasonable to believe the customer is infected.
Looking at user traffic using a “wide net” approach can include external feedback as well as
other internal approaches.
Note that the Best Practices in this grouping are primarily aimed at ISPs that provide service to
consumer end-users on residential broadband networks, but may be applicable to other users and
networks as well.
6.1.16 BP Number: Detection 4
Do Not Block Legitimate Traffic:
ISPs should ensure that detection methods do not block legitimate traffic in the course of
conducting botnet detection, and should instead employ detection methods which seek to be
non-disruptive and transparent to their customers and their customers’ applications.
BP Reference/Comments:
Note that the Best Practices in this grouping are primarily aimed at ISPs that provide service to
consumer end-users on residential broadband networks, but may be applicable to other users and
networks as well.
6.1.17 BP Number: Detection 5
Bot Detection and the Corresponding Notification Should Be Timely:
ISPs should ensure that bot detection and the corresponding notification to end users be timely,
since such security problems are time-sensitive. If complex analysis is required and multiple
confirmations are needed to confirm a bot is indeed present, then it is possible that the malware
may cause some damage, to either the infected host or remotely targeted system (beyond the
damage of the initial infection) before it can be stopped. Thus, an ISP must balance a desire to
definitively confirm a malware infection, which may take an extended period of time, with the
ability to predict the strong likelihood of a malware infection in a very short period of time.
This 'definitive-vs.-likely' challenge is difficult and, when in doubt, ISPs should err on the side
of caution by communicating a likely malware infection while taking reasonable steps to avoid
false notifications.

Draft Report
NOTIFICATION BEST PRACTICES
6.1.18 BP Number: Notification 1
Notification to End Users:
ISPs should develop and maintain critical notification methods to communicate with their
customers that their computer and/or network has likely been infected with malware. This
should include a range of options in order to accommodate a diverse group of customers and
network technologies. Once an ISP has detected a likely end user security problem, steps should
be undertaken to inform the Internet user that they may have a security problem. An ISP should
decide the most appropriate method or methods for providing notification to their customers or
internet users, and should use additional methods if the chosen method is not effective. The
range of notification options may vary by the severity and/or criticality of the problem.
Examples of different notification methods may include but are not limited to: email, telephone
call, postal mail, instant messaging (IM), short messaging service (SMS), and web browser
notification.
BP Reference/Comments:
An ISP decision on the most appropriate method or methods for providing notification to one or
more of their customers or Internet users depends upon a range of factors, from the technical
capabilities of the ISP, to the technical attributes of the ISP's network, cost considerations,
available server resources, available organizational resources, the number of likely infected
hosts detected at any given time, and the severity of any possible threats, among many other
factors. The use of multiple simultaneous notification methods is reasonable for an ISP but may
be difficult for a fake anti-virus purveyor.
Mitigation BP 3 provides information on how to address the malware infection.
Note that the Best Practices in this grouping are primarily aimed at ISPs that provide services to
consumer end-users on residential broadband networks, but may be applicable to other users and
networks as well.
6.1.19 BP Number: Notification 2
Notification Information to End Users:
ISPs should ensure that botnet notifications to subscribers convey critical service information
rather than convey advertising of new services or other offers.
BP Reference/Comments:
This best practice is to help ensure that the notification message is not confused with other
communications the customer may receive from the provider and help underscore the
seriousness of the situation.
Note that the Best Practices in this grouping are primarily aimed at ISPs that provide services to
consumer end-users on residential broadband networks, but may be applicable to other users and
networks as well.

MITIGATION BEST PRACTICES
6.1.20 BP Number: Mitigation 1
Industry Cooperation During Significant Cyber Incidents:
ISPs should maintain an awareness of cyber security threat levels and, when feasible, cooperate
with other organizations during significant cyber incidents, helping to gather and analyze
information to characterize the attack, offer mitigation techniques, and take action to deter or
defend against cyber attacks as authorized by applicable law and policy.
BP Reference/Comments:
National Cyber Incident Response Plan - The National Cyber Risk AlertLevel (NCRAL) is
currently envisioned as a 4-level system in order to facilitate synchronization with several other
alert level systems, such as the IT-ISAC, SANS and those from security vendors. Significant
Cyber Incidents are generally labeled as Severe (level 1) and Substantial (level 2).
Note that the Best Practices in this grouping are primarily aimed at ISPs that provide service to
consumer end-users on residential broadband networks, but may be applicable to other users and
networks as well.
6.1.21 BP Number: Mitigation 2
Temporarily Quarantine Bot Infected Devices:
ISPs may temporarily quarantine a subscriber account or device if a compromised device is
detected on the subscribers’ network and the network device is actively transmitting malicious
traffic. Such quarantining should normally occur only after multiple attempts to notify the
customer of the problem (using varied methods) have not yielded resolution. In the event of a
severe attack or where an infected host poses a significant present danger to the healthy
operation of the network, then immediate quarantine may be appropriate. In any quarantine
situation and depending on the severity of the attack or danger, the ISP should seek to be
responsive to the needs of the customer to regain access to the network. Where feasible, the ISP
may quarantine the attack or malicious traffic and leave the rest unaffected.
BP Reference/Comments:
The temporary delay of web pages for the purpose of providing web browser notification, as
suggested above in the Notification Best Practices (see section 6.1.18 above), does not constitute
a 'quarantine' as used in this Best Practice.
Some information regarding quarantine technology can be found at:

Draft Report
6.1.22 BP Number: Mitigation 3
Provide a Web Site to Assist with Malware Remediation:
ISPs should, either directly or indirectly, provide a web site to assist customers with malware
remediation. Remediation of malware on a host means to remove, disable, or otherwise render a
malicious bot harmless. For example, this may include but is not limited to providing a special
web site with security-oriented content that is dedicated for this purpose, or suggesting a
relevant and trusted third-party web site. This should be a security-oriented web site to which a
user with a bot infection can be directed to for remediation. This security web site should clearly
explain what malware is and the threats that it may pose. Where feasible, there should be a clear
explanation of the steps that the user should take in order to attempt to clean their host, and there
should be information on how users can strive to keep the host free of future infections. The
security web site may also have a guided process that takes non technical users through the
remediation process, on an easily understood, step-by-step basis. The site may also provide
recommendations concerning free as well as for-fee remediation services so that the user
understands that they have a range of options, some of which can be followed at no cost.

PRIVACY BEST PRACTICES
6.1.23 BP Number: Privacy Considerations 1
Privacy Considerations in Botnet Detection, Notification, and Remediation:
Because technical measures to (a) detect compromised end-user devices, (b) notify end-users of
the security issue, and (c) assist in addressing the security issue, may result in the collection of
customer information (including possibly “personally identifiable information” and other
sensitive information, as well as the content of customer communications), ISPs should ensure
that all such technical measures address customers’ privacy, and comply and be consistent with
all applicable laws and corporate privacy policies.
BP Reference/Comments:
Note that the Best Practices in this grouping are primarily aimed at ISPs that provide service to
consumer end-users on residential broadband networks, but may be applicable to other users and
networks as well.
6.1.24 BP Number: Privacy Considerations 2
Measures to Protect Privacy in Botnet Response:
In designing technical measures for identification, notification, or other response to
compromised end-user devices (“technical measures”), ISPs should pursue a multi-prong
strategy to protect the privacy of customers’ information, including but not limited to the
following:
a) ISPs should design technical measures to minimize the collection of customer
information;
b) In the event that customer information is determined to not be needed for the
purpose of responding to security issues, the information should promptly be
discarded;
c) Any access to customer information collected as a result of technical measures
should at all times be limited to those persons reasonably necessary to implement
the botnet-response security program of the ISP, and such individuals’ access
should only be permitted as needed to implement the security program;
d) In the event that temporary retention of customer information is necessary to
identify the source of a malware infection, to demonstrate to the user that
malicious packets are originating from their broadband connection, or for other
purposes directly related to the botnet-response security program, such
information should not be retained longer than reasonably necessary to
implement the security program (except to the extent that law enforcement
investigating or prosecuting a security situation, using appropriate procedures,
has requested that the information be retained); and
e) The ISP’s privacy compliance officer, or another person not involved in the
execution of the security program, should verify compliance by the security
program with appropriate privacy practices.
