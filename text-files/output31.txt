1 Results in Brief
1.1 Executive Summary
The Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) established the
Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) “…to provide
recommendations to the FCC regarding ways it can strive for security, reliability and
interoperability of communications systems… including… emergency alerting." To achieve
that goal, CSRIC V established and chartered various "Working Groups" to examine the
various issues of concern in these areas.
Working Group 3 (WG3) was formed to make recommendations for the CSRIC’s consideration
in three major areas related to the continued improvement and development of the Emergency
Alert System (EAS) as a secure, effective alerting tool for the American public:
1. EAS Security;
2. the provision of EAS in languages other than English; and
3. the update of an operational handbook for individual broadcasters, cable service
providers and other EAS Participants
This Final Report was prepared by the CSRIC V WG3 Project Team on Updating the EAS
Operating Handbook. In this report, the WG3 makes recommendations concerning an updated
EAS Operating Handbook, and related documentation.
According to 47 CFR Part 11, §11.15 of the Commission’s rules, all EAS Participants must have
a copy of the EAS Operating Handbook located at normal duty positions or EAS equipment
locations when an operator is required to be on duty, and be immediately available to staff
responsible for initiating actions associated with the EAS process. Published by the FCC, the
EAS Operating Handbook states in summary form the actions to be taken by personnel at EAS
Participant facilities upon receipt of an EAN, tests, or State and Local Area alerts. The current
handbook is obsolete and contains inaccurate instructions.
Working Group 3 was tasked to “analyze the manner in which the EAS should operate for each
type of EAS Participant (e.g., broadcaster and cable service provider facilities) and shall make
recommendations for textual and visual elements of a handbook suitable for each category of
EAS Participant, with particular attention to be given to rural, smaller and less resourced EAS
Participants.”
The Project Team developed four deliverables:
(1) An Updated EAS Operating Handbook
(2) Instructions for completing the customizable sections in the new Handbook
(3) An outline for the suggested content of an EAS Participant Guide
(4) A list of EAS rules identified as needing update, which concern Handbook topics
An Updated EAS Operating Handbook: This was our Project Team’s primary mission. We
determined that most of the material in the current Handbooks needed to be updated, so the
decision was made to start clean with a new, simpler document. After careful analysis, we felt
we would be able to replace the current set of five separate EAS Operating Handbooks (one for
[3]CSRIC V Working Group 3
Final Report June 2016
each EAS Participant category – Radio, TV, Cable TV, Satellite and Wireline), with just a
single version for use by all EAS Participants. We accomplished this goal by employing the use
of checkboxes and fill-in-the-blank operational steps for each EAS Participant facility to
customize the Handbook to describe its particular implementation of EAS alerting. Examples
demonstrating the flexibility of this strategy include the ability to describe:
 Attended vs. Unattended operation
 Automatic vs. Manual mode operation
 Mixed use of Automatic mode part of the time and Manual mode at other times
 Operation as a decoder-only broadcast station
 The differences between typical facilities in the various EAS Participant groups
 Variations in EAS equipment operation
 Variations in the desired recovery procedures at each EAS Participant facility when
problems with alerts are encountered
As an additional requirement to facilitate the use of a single version of the updated EAS
Operating Handbook by all EAS Participants, we identified the need for a generic description
of the person responsible for EAS applicable at any EAS Participant facility. At broadcast
stations, the FCC rules establish the Chief Operator as responsible for EAS operations, but
there is no such position established in the FCC rules for other EAS Participants. Thus we
created the term “designated individual responsible for EAS operations and compliance at each
EAS Participant facility” in order to keep the EAS Operating Handbook generic for use by all
EAS Participants.
As a final criterion, we concluded that the EAS Operating Handbook should be written to the
operator on duty to give that person the information needed to handle the FCC-required EAS
alerts. To maintain this focus, we eliminated any superfluous details that are not needed by the
operator on duty to relay or originate the alerts required in the EAS rules. This resulted in a
very clean and straightforward updated Handbook. We strongly recommend that no other
content be added to the Handbook. To address the more general EAS details not needed by the
operator on duty in the EAS Operating Handbook, we suggest below that the Commission
consider developing a separate EAS Participant Guide based on the topic list we provide.
Instructions for EAS Operating Handbook: Our recommended, updated EAS Operating
Handbook contains a combination of checkboxes and fill-in-the-blank operational steps to
allow each EAS Participant facility to customize the Handbook to describe its particular
implementation of EAS alerting. It is our intent that these blank sections be completed by the
designated individual responsible for EAS operations and compliance at each EAS Participant
facility. In order to assist that individual in understanding the intent of each blank section, our
Project Team drafted a set of instructions. These instructions should be posted on the FCC
website, along with the EAS Operating Handbook.
Suggested Content of an EAS Participant Guide: Acknowledging that the EAS Operating
Handbook is specifically written to the operator on duty to determine the steps necessary to
relay or originate the alerts required in the EAS rules, our Project Team felt that an additional
document aimed at the designated individual responsible for EAS operations and compliance at
each EAS Participant facility may be of benefit for the Commission to highlight EAS details
needed by this EAS responsible individual but not needed by the operator on duty in the EAS
Operating Handbook. We suggest the title EAS Participant Guide, and in this report present in
[4]CSRIC V Working Group 3
Final Report June 2016
outline form a list of the proposed topics for this Guide.
EAS Rules Identified as Needing Update: Our final deliverable is a list of issues in the EAS
rules discovered while drafting the updated EAS Operating Handbook. We recommend that the
FCC consider updating those rules to remove obsolete concepts and clear up ambiguities.
In addition to the four deliverables, the Project Team adopted the following recommendation:
Support from Manufacturers: Our Project Team recommends that the FCC encourage each EAS
equipment manufacturer to define for its users how to implement the various choices discussed
in the Handbook and its associated Instructions. The guidance should clearly reference each
task in the Handbook, and provide help and understanding about how to accomplish each task
with that manufacturer’s equipment, either by reference to existing documentation or with new
documentation, using the particular manufacturer’s terms and technologies.
2 Introduction
CSRIC V Working Group 3 was established to make recommendations for the CSRIC’s
consideration in three major areas related to the continued improvement and development of
the Emergency Alert System (EAS) as a secure, effective alerting tool for the American public:
(1) EAS Security; (2) the provision of EAS in languages other than English; and (3) the update
of an operational handbook for individual broadcasters, cable service providers and other EAS
Participants.
In order to address the relevant issues, a diverse team of subject matter experts was recruited to
participate. The following areas of expertise are represented within the group.
 Message Originators: FEMA; NWS; State & Local Emergency Managers; State EAS
Networks
 EAS Participants: Radio; TV; Cable TV; Satellite TV; Satellite Radio; Wireline
Video/IPTV
 EAS Equipment Manufacturers
 State Emergency Communications Committee Chairs and Members
 EAS Experts and Consultants
CSRIC Working Group 3 is divided into three sub-groups:
 EAS Security – Recommend steps for assessing any barriers to the adoption of the
CSRIC IV best practices, make recommendations on incentives, both regulatory and
non-regulatory for affected stakeholders to adopt the best practices, and recommend
methods by which other EAS stakeholders may gain assurance that the best practices are
being implemented.
 Multilingual EAS – The Working Group will recommend best practices for the
delivery of multilingual EAS and emergency information.
 Updating the EAS Operating Handbook – Update and modernize the EAS
Handbook, which states in summary form the actions to be taken by personnel at EAS
Participant facilities upon receipt of an EAN, tests, or State and Local Area alerts.
[5]CSRIC V Working Group 3
Final Report June 2016
In the description of Working Group 3, the Commission expresses concern that the current EAS
Operating Handbook “is obsolete and contains inaccurate instructions”. This is of particular
importance, as the Handbook describes the steps necessary at EAS Participant facilities to relay
a message from the President.
In this report, WG3 discusses recommendations for an updated and modernized EAS Operating
Handbook suitable for use by all EAS Participant facilities.

3 Objective, Scope, and Methodology
3.1 Objective
The working group has been tasked to “analyze the manner in which the EAS should operate
for each type of EAS Participant (e.g., broadcaster and cable service provider facilities) and
shall make recommendations for textual and visual elements of a handbook suitable for each
category of EAS Participant, with particular attention to be given to rural, smaller and less
resourced EAS Participants.”
3.2 Scope
This document addresses the deliverables outlined in the CSRIC V charter for Working Group
#3. The working group endeavored to develop an updated EAS Operating Handbook suitable for
use by all categories of EAS Participants, as well as craft the instructions for completing the
customizable blank portions of the Handbook.
The Project Team took the following EAS Participant categories into consideration regarding
the development of the updated EAS Operating Handbook:
 Radio Broadcasters
 TV Broadcasters
[7]CSRIC V Working Group 3
Final Report June 2016
 Cable TV Providers
 Satellite Radio Providers
 Satellite TV Providers
 Wireline/IPTV Providers
The Project Team took the following logistical/technical factors into consideration regarding
the development of the updated EAS Operating Handbook:
 Attended vs. Unattended operation
 Automatic vs. Manual mode operation
 Mixed use of Automatic mode part of the time and Manual mode at other times
 Operation as a decoder-only broadcast station
 Corporate vs. local facility oversight
 Variations in EAS equipment operation
 The differences between typical facilities in the various EAS Participant groups
The Project Team devoted particular attention to the needs of rural, smaller and less resourced
EAS Participants, resulting in the following considerations:
 Assessing the effect of all the factors above on these less resourced EAS Participants
 Designing a straight-forward and simple updated EAS Operating Handbook
 Including background information in the Instructions document
 Recommending that the FCC develop an EAS Participant Guide based on our
suggested content in Appendix C, a resource that could be of great benefit to these
facilities
 Highlighting that the FCC needs to adopt a new rule to instruct decoder-only stations
on the action they are to take when receiving an EAN or NPT
 Recommending that the Commission encourage EAS equipment manufacturers to
provide guidance to their users on implementing the various choices discussed in the
Handbook and its associated Instructions, another resource that could be of great
benefit to these facilities
Finally, although not specifically in the Working Group 3 description, the Project Team
endeavored to address any issues that were a logical extension of our work in updating the EAS
Operating Handbook. This analysis led to recommendations for an EAS Participant Guide, and
a list of EAS rules identified as needing update.
3.3 Methodology
The Project Team used a collaborative, inclusive approach. Given the expertise of various team
members, it was important to provide an open forum through which participants could express
their opinions and help shape this report. These discussions largely took place during a series of
weekly conference calls moderated by the Project Team chair, Gary Timm, Broadcast Chair of
the Wisconsin State Emergency Communications Committee.
4 Background
The current FCC EAS Operating Handbooks have not been updated since 2007. In the Working
Group 3 description, the Commission notes “the current Handbook is obsolete and contains
inaccurate instructions”.
[8]CSRIC V Working Group 3
Final Report June 2016
An important focus of the EAS Operating Handbook is to provide guidance for EAS
Participants to relay the Presidential Emergency Action Notification (EAN) message. In 2012,
the EAS Fifth Report and Order1 fundamentally changed the way the Presidential message is
transmitted. First, the Emergency Action Termination (EAT) alert was eliminated. Secondly,
the FCC implemented what it calls “message-by-message processing” where the Presidential
message follows the same sequence as all other EAS alerts; an initial EAS code, in this case
EAN, followed by the audio message and terminated by an End-of-Message (EOM) code. Any
further broadcasts would repeat this sequence. The Commission notes in this Order, “We
conclude that revising the rules governing EAN processing is necessary because they were
designed to accommodate the EAN Network, which was phased out in 1995, and purely
manual operation.” The FCC thus revised section §11.54 of the EAS rules. These changes
made the instructions in the current Handbooks obsolete.
5 Recommendations
WG3 makes the following recommendations to the Commission, detailed in this section and
summarized in the Conclusions section.
The Project Team developed four deliverables, presented as appendices to this report:
Appendix A: CSRIC Recommendation for updated EAS Operating Handbook
Appendix B: Instructions for Completing Customizable Sections in new Handbook
Appendix C: Suggested Content of an EAS Participant Guide
Appendix D: EAS Rules Identified as Needing Update
CSRIC Recommendation for updated EAS Operating Handbook: This was our Project Team’s
primary mission. We determined that most of the material in the current Handbooks needed to
be updated, so the decision was made to start clean with a new, simpler document. After careful
analysis, we felt we would be able to replace the current set of five separate EAS Operating
Handbooks (one for each EAS Participant category – Radio, TV, Cable TV, Satellite and
Wireline), with just a single version for use by all EAS Participants. We accomplished this goal
by employing the use of checkboxes and fill-in-the-blank operational steps for each EAS
Participant facility to customize the Handbook to describe its particular implementation of EAS
alerting. Examples demonstrating the flexibility of this strategy include the ability to describe:
 Attended vs. Unattended operation
 Automatic vs. Manual mode operation
 Mixed use of Automatic mode part of the time and Manual mode at other times
 Operation as a decoder-only broadcast station
 The differences between typical facilities in the various EAS Participant groups
 Variations in EAS equipment operation
 Variations in the desired recovery procedures at each EAS Participant facility when
problems with alerts are encountered
As an additional requirement to facilitate the use of a single version of the updated EAS

Operating Handbook by all EAS Participants, we identified the need for a generic description
of the person responsible for EAS applicable at any EAS Participant facility. At broadcast
stations, the FCC rules establish the Chief Operator as responsible for EAS operations, but
there is no such position established in the FCC rules for other EAS Participants. Thus we
created the term “designated individual responsible for EAS operations and compliance at each
EAS Participant facility” in order to keep the EAS Operating Handbook generic for use by all
EAS Participants.
As a final criterion, we concluded that the EAS Operating Handbook should be written to the
operator on duty to give that person the information needed to handle the FCC-required EAS
alerts. To maintain this focus, we eliminated any superfluous details that are not needed by the
operator on duty to relay or originate the alerts required in the EAS rules. This resulted in a
very clean and straightforward updated Handbook. We strongly recommend that no other
content be added to the Handbook. To address the more general EAS details not needed by the
operator on duty in the EAS Operating Handbook, we suggest below that the Commission
consider developing a separate EAS Participant Guide based on the topic list we provide.
Instructions for Completing Customizable Sections in new EAS Operating Handbook: Our
recommended, updated EAS Operating Handbook contains a combination of checkboxes and
fill-in-the-blank operational steps to allow each EAS Participant facility to customize the
Handbook to describe its particular implementation of EAS alerting. It is our intent that these
blank sections be completed by the designated individual responsible for EAS operations and
compliance at each EAS Participant facility. In order to assist that individual in understanding
the intent of each blank section, our Project Team drafted a set of instructions. These
instructions should be posted on the FCC website, along with the EAS Operating Handbook.
Suggested Content of an EAS Participant Guide: Acknowledging that the EAS Operating
Handbook is specifically written to the operator on duty to determine the steps necessary to
relay or originate the alerts required in the EAS rules, our Project Team felt that an additional
document aimed at the designated individual responsible for EAS operations and compliance at
each EAS Participant facility may be of benefit for the Commission to highlight EAS details
needed by this EAS responsible individual but not needed by the operator on duty in the EAS
Operating Handbook. We suggest the title EAS Participant Guide, and in this report present in
outline form a list of the proposed topics for this Guide.
EAS Rules Identified as Needing Update: Our final deliverable is a list of issues in the EAS
rules discovered while drafting the updated EAS Operating Handbook. We recommend that the
FCC consider updating those rules to remove obsolete concepts and clear up ambiguities.
In addition to the four deliverables, the Project Team adopted the following recommendation:
Support from Manufacturers: Our Project Team recommends that the FCC encourage each EAS
equipment manufacturer to define for its users how to implement the various choices discussed
in the Handbook and its associated Instructions. The guidance should clearly reference each
task in the Handbook, and provide help and understanding about how to accomplish each task
with that manufacturer’s equipment, either by reference to existing documentation or with new
documentation, using the particular manufacturer’s terms and technologies.
[10]CSRIC V Working Group 3
Final Report June 2016
6 Conclusions
The EAS Operating Handbook Project Team succeeded in developing an updated EAS
Operating Handbook and Instructions, following the Project Team’s preference for a single
version for use by all EAS Participants. As a matter of course in drafting the updated Handbook,
the Project Team research revealed that two additional limited-scope deliverables would be of
value to the Commission. Thus we developed in outline form a list of topics for a recommended
EAS Participant Guide, as well as collected a list of EAS rules identified as needing update in
connection with the topics addressed in the updated Handbook. Finally, we concluded that EAS
Participants would benefit from guidance provided by their EAS equipment manufacturers.
To summarize, WG3 recommends that the FCC should:
(1) Adopt the updated EAS Operating Handbook presented in this report as Appendix A.
(2) Adopt the Instructions for completing the customizable sections in the new Handbook,
presented in this report as Appendix B.
(3) Develop an EAS Participant Guide, following the suggested content outlined in this
report as Appendix C.
(4) Consider amending the EAS rules identified as needing update in Appendix D of this
report.
(5) Encourage EAS equipment manufacturers to define for their users how to implement the
various choices discussed in the Handbook and its associated Instructions.
[11]CSRIC V Working Group 3
Final Report June 2016
A. Appendix A: CSRIC Recommendation for updated EAS
Operating Handbook
The document presented here in Appendix A is the recommendation of WG3 as the updated EAS
Operating Handbook. It is intended as a single version of the Handbook, written to enable use by all
EAS Participant categories. In order to accommodate the different types of EAS Participants and the
operational variations within each EAS Participant group, the Handbook contains customizable blank
sections to be filled in by the designated individual responsible for EAS operations and compliance at
each EAS Participant facility. Appendix B of this report contains the Instructions drafted by WG3 to
aid in the completion of the blank sections of the Handbook.
The Project Team concluded that the EAS Operating Handbook should be written to the operator on
duty to give that person the information needed to handle the FCC-required EAS alerts. To maintain
this focus, we eliminated any superfluous details that are not needed by the operator on duty to relay
or originate the alerts required in the EAS rules. This resulted in a very clean and straightforward
updated Handbook. We strongly recommend that no other content be added to the Handbook.
To address the more general EAS details not needed by the operator on duty in the EAS Operating
Handbook, we suggest that the Commission consider developing a separate EAS Participant Guide
based on the topic list we provide in Appendix C.
Notes:
 It is our intent to merely furnish the text of the Handbook and leave the formatting up to the
Commission. However, we have the following thoughts:
o WG3 recommends this Handbook be created in the Portrait layout, as opposed to Landscape
layout, in order to easily differentiate the new, updated Handbook from the old Handbooks.
o It occurs to us that an appropriate format may be a “fillable PDF” similar to the IRS Form
1040, where the user can complete checkboxes and blank lines and then save the PDF for
future changes.
o PDFs also typically have a feature allowing pop-up balloons to be assigned to the blank lines,
which could display the instructions for completing that line when the user moves the
computer mouse pointer over that particular blank line. This method could eliminate the need
for a separate Instructions document altogether.
 On the second page of this Handbook quoting rule §11.15, we eliminated the words “the EAT”
and we dropped the second half of the last sentence from the current rule. In Appendix D of this
report, we recommend that the Commission drop these two phrases from the current §11.15 rule.
 The FCC may need to revise this Handbook if any other changes are made to the EAS rules as a
result of the issues we raise in our Appendix D, such as but not limited to, how decoder-only
stations are to handle received EANs and NPTs (in §11.54), and if the required RWT can be
relayed or must be originated (in §11.61).
 Although the Handbook we created contains only three steps for each manual procedure list, we
anticipate some facilities may require more than three steps. By listing only three steps, we did
not intend to imply that we feel only three steps are needed in any given facility. Rather, we leave
it to the Commission to determine the number of blank steps it wishes to offer in each manual
procedure. If the Commission could find a mechanism for the user to dynamically add steps as
needed, this would provide the optimal flexibility for all facilities.

B. Appendix B: Instructions for Completing Customizable
Sections in new Handbook
The recommended, updated EAS Operating Handbook contains a combination of checkboxes
and fill-in-the-blank operational steps to allow each EAS Participant facility to customize the
Handbook to describe its particular implementation of EAS alerting. It is the intent of WG3 that
these blank sections be completed by the designated individual responsible for EAS operations
and compliance at each EAS Participant facility. In order to assist that individual in
understanding the intent of each blank section, WG3 offers the following set of instructions.
These instructions should be posted on the FCC website, along with the EAS Operating
Handbook.
Notes:
 The arrows and highlighting in the layout of this document are merely intended for WG3 to
communicate to the FCC the instructions we intend to go with each blank checkbox and
blank line. The layout WG3 used is not necessarily our recommendation for a format. We
leave it to the Commission to determine whether our arrows, highlighting and side columns
of text are an appropriate layout for this document.
 While it is our intent to merely furnish the text of these Handbook Instructions and leave the
text formatting up to the Commission, it occurs to us that if a format such as a “fillable PDF”
were used for the Handbook, it may be possible to assign PDF pop-up balloons to the blank
lines, which could display the instructions for completing that line when the user moves the
computer mouse pointer over that particular blank line. This method may then eliminate the
need for a separate Instructions document altogether.
 WG3 suggests these Instructions be an online document, with the cited EAS rules as
clickable links.
 The FCC may need to revise these Handbook Instructions if any changes are made to the
EAS rules as a result of the issues we raise in our Appendix D, such as but not limited to,
how decoder-only stations are to handle received EANs and NPTs (in §11.54), and if the
required RWT can be relayed or must be originated (in §11.61).

INSTRUCTIONS FOR
2016 EAS Operating Handbook
IMPORTANT: These Instructions are for use by the designated
individual responsible for EAS operations and compliance at
your facility. Check with your manager or supervisor if you are
uncertain regarding your authority to use these Instructions to
complete the FCC-required EAS Operating Handbook
information.
[B-1]CSRIC V Working Group 3
Final Report June 2016
Instructions for Completing Blank Sections in
the FCC EAS Operating Handbook by the
Designated Individual Responsible for EAS
Operations and Compliance at this Facility
Follow these instructions for completing the checkboxes
and fill-in-the-blank fields in your EAS Operating
Handbook before it is posted. Reminder: FCC rules
require posting of your facility’s Handbook at all EAS
operating positions.
You may need to consult information from the
manufacturer of your EAS device, and your State or Local
EAS Plan, for guidance in completing the blank sections
of this Handbook.
On the following pages, the checkboxes are utilized to
indicate if your facility handles each alert-type in the
Automatic mode or in the Manual mode. Manual mode
means the operator on duty needs to perform steps to
relay or originate the alert. Thus, the checkboxes always
occur in pairs separated by the word “OR”, and you
should be selecting only one of the two check boxes.
[B-2]CSRIC V Working Group 3
Final Report June 2016
Note regarding the checkboxes above: If your facility
operates in Automatic part of the time and Manual at
other times, it is suggested that you checkmark the
Manual mode box and in Step 1 of the procedure list the
hours your facility is in Automatic mode when no
operator intervention is required.
The fill-in-the-blank fields are intended for you to fill in
the steps that your operator on duty needs to perform if
you had check-marked the box on that page indicating
operator action is needed. If you check-marked the
Automatic box, then these steps should be left blank.
The following instructions detail decisions to be made on
each page of the EAS Operating Handbook.

Decoder-Only Exceptions
Class D non-commercial educational FM, LPFM, and LPTV
stations are granted the exception in FCC rules of not
being required to install an EAS Encoder. However, these
stations may install an Encoder/Decoder if desired. If
your facility does operate an Encoder/Decoder, then
follow the instructions in this document as described. If
your facility operates as decoder-only, the following
exceptions can be applied.
Decoder-Only Required Monthly Test:
FCC rule 11.61(a)(1)(i) states that, “Analog and digital
class D non-commercial educational FM, analog and
digital LPFM stations, and analog and digital LPTV
stations are required to transmit only the test script.”
In the following Instructions for RMT, Class D NCE FM,
LPFM, and LPTV stations should check-mark the box
indicating “operator on duty is required to perform the
following steps”, and as Step 1 fill in a statement such as,
“Read the following script on the air, “This is a Required
Monthly Test…”, using the appropriate script for your
area as found in the State EAS Plan.
[B-4]CSRIC V Working Group 3
Final Report June 2016
Decoder-Only Required Weekly Test:
FCC rule 11.61(a)(2)(ii) states, “DBS providers, analog and
digital class D non-commercial educational FM stations,
analog and digital LPFM stations, and analog and digital
LPTV stations are not required to transmit this test.”
In the following Instructions for RWT, if your facility
operates as decoder-only, you should check-mark the
box at the top of the RWT page indicating your facility is
exempt from originating the RWT.

C. Appendix C: Suggested Content of an EAS Participant Guide
Acknowledging that the EAS Operating Handbook is specifically written to the operator on duty
to determine the steps necessary to relay or originate the alerts required in the EAS rules, our
Project Team felt that an additional document aimed at the designated individual responsible for
EAS operations and compliance at each EAS Participant facility may be of benefit for the
Commission to highlight EAS details needed by this EAS responsible individual but not needed
by the operator on duty in the EAS Operating Handbook. We suggest the title EAS Participant
Guide, and in this Appendix C present in outline form a list of the proposed topics for this Guide.
Notes:
 WG3 feels that this Guide is likely to be a “book” when considering the depth of its content.
As such, we felt that creating an entire book goes beyond our expertise, and should be left to
a “tech writer” at the FCC. Thus we limited our deliverable to an outline of the topics we see
as beneficial in this Guide, leaving the actual layout and composition to a professional tech
writer at the FCC.
 While we outline a section addressing the required entry of data into the ETRS, further
details will likely arise as the FCC more fully develops the ETRS entry fields. We trust that
the Commission will supplement that section with whatever pertinent details come to light as
ETRS is rolled out.
 Although we noted the FCC Broadcast Self-Inspection Checklists as a resource in this Guide,
we note that FCC needs to update these Checklists, as they date from 2008-2010.
 The FCC may need to revise this Guide if any changes are made to the EAS rules as a result
of the issues we raise in our Appendix D, such as but not limited to, how decoder-only
stations are to handle received EANs and NPTs (in §11.54), and if the required RWT can be
relayed or must be originated (in §11.61).
 WG3 suggests that this EAS Participant Guide would be useful to Alternative Broadcast
Inspection Program (ABIP) inspectors.
[C-0]CSRIC V Working Group 3
Final Report June 2016
EAS Participant Guide - Topic List
A deliverable of the CSRIC V – WG3, EAS Handbook Project Team
Audience:
This Guide is aimed at the designated individual responsible for EAS operations and compliance at all
EAS Participant facilities. (As opposed to the posted EAS Operating Handbook, which is aimed at the
operator on duty solely to determine the steps necessary to relay or originate the alerts required in the
EAS rules.)
Purpose:
To highlight the more pertinent details of the EAS rules, particularly regarding required actions and
items associated with the EAN, NPT, RMT, RWT, and State/Local alerting topics only dealt with at the
operator level in the EAS Operating Handbook.
Format:
This Guide is intended as a single version, for use by all EAS Participants.
Suggested Topic Areas:
EAS Participant Facility-Specific Details:
 Blank lines to fill in the EAS Monitoring Assignments required in the State EAS Plan.
o (blank checkbox) This facility has a waiver to monitor the sources above.
 Blank lines to fill in Waiver Issue Date, and Waiver Issued By, if applicable.
 Blank lines to fill in any additional, voluntary EAS sources monitored.
 Blank lines to fill in facility management decisions on what alerts to carry and relay timing.
 Blank lines to fill in other Waivers this facility has been granted (i.e., EAS Internet access waiver).
EAS Responsible Individual:
 Broadcasters are required by FCC rules to designate a station Chief Operator, whose duties
include EAS operations and compliance. (See FCC rules §73.1870 and §73.1820)
 Cable, Satellite, DBS, and Wireline: Although not required in FCC rules, if a “designated
individual responsible for EAS operations and compliance” hasn’t been identified, best practices
suggest that each EAS Participant facility appoint one.
EAS Security Best Practices:
A checklist of EAS security best practices for EAS Participants was recommended in a May 2014 Report
by the CSRIC IV - WG3, EAS Security Subcommittee. See the Resources section of this Guide for a URL to
the full report.
Electronic Test Reporting System (ETRS)
 Following an NPT test, all EAS Participants must enter their test results into the FCC Electronic
Test Reporting System (ETRS). Day of Test information must be entered within 24 hours of the
test, and Detailed Post-Test Data must be entered within 45 days of the test. (See FCC rule
§11.61(a)(3)
 The FCC will need to update this document with the requirements for entering initial ETRS data,
once those requirements are established by the Commission.

monthly tests for all EAS Participants… in the week and month in which it occurs.”
o FCC rule 11.61(a)(4) states, “The EAS may be activated for emergencies or special tests
at the State or Local Area level by an EAS Participant instead of the monthly or weekly
tests required in this section. To substitute for the weekly test… activation must include
transmission of the EAS header and EOM codes.”
o DBS Providers, and Class D NCE FM, LPFM, and LPTV stations are not required to
transmit the Required Weekly Test (RWT). See FCC rule §11.61(a)(2)(ii).
 FCC rule 11.51(m) states, “When transmitting the required weekly test, EAS Participants shall
use the event code RWT. The location codes are the state and county for the broadcast station
city of license or system community or city. Other location codes may be included upon
approval of station or system management.”
 FCC rule 11.61(a)(2)(iv) states that, “EAS Participants are not required to transmit a video
message when transmitting the required weekly test.”
 The RWT can be transmitted automatically or manually.
 The transmitted RWT may have an announcement before or after the test, but it is not required.
 EAS Participants must receive an RWT each week from each of their two monitoring
assignments shown in the State EAS Plan.
 The received and transmitted RWTs must be documented in the EAS Participant’s EAS Log or
records according to facility policy.
 If an RWT is not received or the required RWT is not initiated, EAS Participants must document
in the EAS Log or records the cause of the failure and any remedies to correct the problem.

Final Report June 2016
 Received RWTs are not relayed, they are only documented in the EAS Log.
o NOTE TO FCC: WG3 believes the above statement to be true, but is aware that some
EAS Participants relay a received RWT rather than originate their own RWT each week.
The FCC needs to clarify in the rules whether it is acceptable for an EAS Participant to
relay an RWT to fulfill the weekly RWT rule, or if an RWT must be originated by the EAS
Participant’s own EAS Encoder.
State and Local EAS Alerts:
 All State and Local alerts are at the EAS Participant’s discretion. FCC rule 11.52(d)(5) states,
“The management of EAS Participants shall determine which header codes will automatically
interrupt their programming for State and Local Area emergency situations affecting their
audiences.”
 However, if an EAS Participant chooses to carry those alerts then FCC rules state that the
procedures in the State or Local EAS Plan must be followed. FCC rule 11.55(d)(1) states, “EAS
Participants participating in the State or Local Area EAS must follow the procedures for
processing such messages in the State and Local Area Plans.”
 State or Local EAS alerts can be relayed in the Automatic or Manual mode.
 The transmission times of State and Local alerts must be documented in the EAS Participant’s
EAS Log or records according to facility policy.
 The individual responsible for EAS operations and compliance, in consultation with facility
management, should develop guidance for the operator on duty to follow regarding state and
local alerting. You should consult information found in the applicable State or Local EAS Plans to
develop this guidance. It should then be displayed prominently at all EAS operator positions, and
its location noted in the State and Local Alerts section of the EAS Operating Handbook.
WG3 further recommendations to FCC on this document:
Terminology:
 Keep terms generic:
o Don’t use broadcaster-specific terms such as Chief Engineer or Chief Operator.
o When referring to EAS Participants, use “facility” rather than “station”.
o When referring to EAS monitoring, use “source” rather than “station”.

D. Appendix D: EAS Rules Identified as Needing Update
This appendix is a list of issues in the EAS rules discovered while drafting the updated EAS
Operating Handbook. We recommend that the FCC consider updating these rules to remove
obsolete concepts and clear up ambiguities.
We tried to carefully match our recommendations for the Handbook and Instructions documents
to the underlying Part 11 rules. While doing so, we encountered some portions of the rules that:
 Need clarification, for example, to reconcile immediate relay of a nationwide test when a
local emergency message is already in progress
 Are missing guidance, such as actions to be taken by decoder-only stations during an
EAN
 Contain concepts that are no longer relevant, such as manual message authentication
 Need minor clean up, such as a remaining reference to the EAT event code
We have listed all of these items in this document. We recommend the FCC review these items
and make appropriate changes to Part 11 to remove rules no longer needed and to add clarity
where needed to other rules.
Notes:
 It is WG3’s intent in this section to merely highlight the rules we feel need Commission
attention and likely revision, but in most cases we did not endeavor to draft proposed
alternate language. A notes column is included in the table to explain the issue we identified
with the indicated rule.
 Any changes made to the EAS rules as a result of the issues we raise in this Appendix D,
such as but not limited to, how decoder-only stations are to handle received EANs and NPTs
(in §11.54), and if the required RWT can be relayed or must be originated (in §11.61), will
likely result in changes needed in the other deliverables of this CSRIC Report.
