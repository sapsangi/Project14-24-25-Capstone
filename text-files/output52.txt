1 Results in Brief
1.1 Executive Summary
The Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council (“CSRIC” or the
“Council”) is a federal advisory committee established by the Federal Communications
Commission (“FCC” or the “Commission”) to provide recommendations to the FCC regarding
best practices and actions the Commission may take to ensure optimal operability, security,
reliability, and resilience of communications systems. The systems at issue include
telecommunications, media, and public safety communications systems. The FCC created ten
Working Groups to develop information for CSRIC, and each of the groups was given a charter
of responsibilities relating to a topic area.
Working Group 2 (“WG2” or the “Working Group”) was established to examine next generation
alerting, to explore many aspects of alerting with a focus on utilization of the Internet and other
broadband-based resources, and to develop recommendations for CSRIC’s consideration
regarding actions the FCC should take to promote deployment of next generation alerting
systems.
WG2 identified five constituencies that are likely to have stakes in the activities of next
generation alerting – government and non-governmental organization alerting system operators,
providers of distribution platforms, makers of receiving devices, content providers, and access
and functional needs interests – and energetically recruited members from those constituencies,
with the goal of informing our work and ensuring that our recommendations would take into
account a diverse collection of perspectives.
WG2 also established three committees to focus on separate portions of the charter given to the
Working Group by the FCC: Architectures and Platforms, Technical and Operational Criteria,
and Social Media Alerting. The committees surveyed the current alerting systems, evaluated
concerns with those capabilities, and identified issues that can be addressed constructively in the
development of next generation alerting practices and resources. Through the efforts of the
committees, WG2 examined the users of alerts and warnings, reviewed the pertinent legislative
and regulatory framework affecting alerting, developed an “alert activity chain” to illustrate
common alerting designs and terminology, identified areas in which standards bodies currently
provide significant value in the design and operation of alerting systems and where further
standards work would be beneficial, analyzed how the public reacts to messages received
through official government channels as well as social media, and examined ways in which
increased use of social media could provide value in delivering larger amounts of useful alert-
related information to diverse groups of recipients before, during, and immediately following an
emergency or crisis.
WG2 has developed recommendations for CSRIC concerning actions the FCC should take to
promote deployment of next generation alerting systems involving the following topics:
• Protection and strengthening of the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) to ensure that all
participants in the alerting process can communicate efficiently as system capabilities
evolve.
Page 5 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
• Provision of funding to support the implementation and sustaining of alerting system
architecture.
• Development of processes and standards to govern practices of implementing CAP.
• Supporting the rapid development of devices for recipients of alerts with improved
capacities for disseminating relevant, geographically targeted alerting information.
• Encouraging creation of strategic plans for identifying and streamlining the deployment
of new alert dissemination technologies.
• Special actions to promote research and development for technologies that will convey
alert information effectively for individual groups within the access and functional needs
communities.
• Arrangements for standardized training for emergency managers on using social media
for alerting, for producing a strategic vision for creating tools that support use of social
media for alerting, and for developing programs to ensure the efficacy of using the
resources of social media for public alerting.
• Creation of industry advisory bodies to provide guidance for a future version of the
Commercial Mobile Alert System (taking into account the advent and wide use of
smartphones and the migration to fourth-generation or “4G” networks) and to develop
standards for deployment of broadband alerting.
• Ensuring that deployment of next generation alerting capabilities does not exclude the
continued provision of alert information via existing technologies that continue to be
available (so as not to exclude users of such legacy technologies from alerts), but
incorporates those technologies into next generation alert delivery methods as much as
possible.
Most importantly, in recognition of (i) the ongoing development and implementation of the
Emergency Alert System (“EAS”) and the Commercial Mobile Alert System (“CMAS”) and (ii)
the continuing and rapid advances in the fields of broadband system design, content delivery,
Internet applications, and social media services, WG2 believes that the FCC should create a
working group as part of a future CSRIC to take into account those developments and advances
in building upon WG2’s recommendations for promoting deployment of next generation
alerting.
2 Introduction
The CSRIC was established by the FCC as a federal advisory committee designed to provide
recommendations to the Commission regarding best practices and actions the Commission may
take to ensure optimal operability, security, reliability, and resiliency of communications
systems, including telecommunications, media, and public safety communications systems.
Due to the large scope of the CSRIC mandate, the FCC created 10 Working Groups to assist the
Council in its work, with each group being assigned to examine a specific set of issues.
Working Group 2 (“WG2” or the “Working Group”) was asked to examine Next Generation
Alerting. WG2 officially started its work in September 2011.

3 Objective, Scope, and Methodology
3.1 Objective
Consistent with its written charter from the FCC, the Working Group explored all aspects of
next generation alerting and developed recommendations for CSRIC’s consideration regarding
actions the FCC should take to promote deployment of next generation alerting systems. The
Working Group reviewed alerting architectures, such as those used for the Integrated Public
Alert and Warning System (“IPAWS”),1 Wireless Emergency Alerts (“WEA”) (the new name
for the Personal Localized Alerting Network, or “PLAN”), and the distributed architecture
presented by the Internet Engineering Task Force (“IETF”) Authority to the Citizen Alert
(“ATOCA”) Working Group.2 The Working Group considered the manner in which these
architectures, and others under development, may interoperate and interconnect to assure
effective delivery of alerts. In addition, the Working Group examined different communications
distribution platforms, (e.g., Internet, Satellite, Digital Television (“DTV”) Datacast, Mobile
DTV, etc.) for alert delivery and discussed how the various architectures exploit these
distribution platforms. The Working Group also explored what alert delivery media (e.g., video,
audio, text, graphics, etc.) can be used for the most effective delivery of next generation alerts
and developed recommendations regarding how the receiving platforms (e.g., mobile phone and
other wireless devices, broadcast, cable, satellite, laptops, tablets etc.) may best present the
transmitted alerts to users.
In addition, the Working Group developed recommendations regarding the technical and
operational criteria under which next generation alerting participants can utilize the Internet and
other broadband-based architectures. The operational criteria included the relationships among
different entities, including, local, tribal, state and federal governments in generating and
distributing alerts. The technical requirements included consideration of the Common Alerting
Protocol and other protocols for generating, formatting, and distributing alerts, as well as
security requirements (including any trust models) to mitigate potential threats and attacks on
the alerting systems.
Finally, the Working Group explored and developed recommendations regarding the role of
social media in next generation alerting systems, including how governments may integrate
social media into their own alerting systems.

3.3 Methodology
The Working Group used a collaborative, inclusive approach to its work. Given the vast array
of expertise the group members brought to bear on this effort, it was critical to provide a
multitude of forums and mediums through which participants could express their opinions and
help shape this final report. The Working Group conducted monthly conference calls and held
in-person meetings in Washington, DC. During the initial months of work, the Working Group
arranged for presentations on the alerting systems currently in use or development, to help
assure that the members had a common knowledge base for assessing alerting issues. The
Working Group had speakers address additional topics at the face-to-face meetings in
Washington. Members also toured facilities at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
at the American Red Cross to see alerting systems in operation. The following section details
the methodology through which the group achieved this objective.
3.3.1 Sub-Group Structure
After recruiting and its initial set of meetings, the Co-Chairs decided to break the working group
into three committees: Architectures and Platforms Committee, Technical and Operational
Criteria Committee and Social Media Alerting Committee. Many members of WG2 served on
more than one committee.
Committee 1: Architectures and Platforms. The Architectures and Platforms Committee was
tasked to develop recommendations regarding how various combinations of alerting
architectures, distribution platforms (transport infrastructures), and receiving platforms (end-user
devices) may best present transmitted alerts to users.
Committee #1 Co-Chairs: Ed Czarnecki, Brian Rosen, Hisham Kassab
Explored topics:
1. Handling multi-media alerts in different networks
2. Adding new alert dissemination technologies
3. Access for alert originators
4. Data format(s) for alert messages
5. Adherence to digital security standards
6. Devices for receiving emergency alerts
7. User control over receipt of alerts (opt in / opt out)
Committee 2: Technical and Operational Criteria Committee. The Technical and
Operational Criteria Committee was tasked to develop recommendations regarding the technical
Page 9 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
and operational criteria under which next generation alerting participants can utilize the Internet
and other broadband-based architectures.
Committee #2 Co-Chairs: Ron Boyer, Ann Marie Cederberg, Brian Daly
Explored topics:
1. Issues with communications systems and networks
2. Key information absent from current alerts
3. Techniques for geo-targeting alerts
4. Emerging technologies
Committee 3: Social Media Alerting Committee. The Social Media Alerting Committee was
tasked to develop recommendations regarding the role of social media in next generation
alerting systems, including how governments may integrate social media into their own alerting
systems.
Committee #3 Co-Chairs: Denis Gusty, Hisham Kassab
Explored topics:
1. Understanding public response
2. Importance for access and functional needs consumers
3. Compatibility with other Internet tools
Each of the three committees held frequent conference calls. The Co-Chairs of each committee
framed conversation and discussion amongst the participants. The Co-Chairs had a free hand to
investigate/coordinate as they saw fit. They worked to bring members closer to consensus and
encouraged open dialogue designed to find common ground. For each committee meeting,
extensive notes were captured and analyzed to determine if there was overlap in the issues being
discussed.
3.3.2 Collaboration via Portal
In addition to the regular conference calls and in-person meetings, an online collaboration portal
was implemented for use by the participants. The portal was accessible to all Working Group
members throughout the duration of their work on behalf the CSRIC. The table below details
some of the most prominent capabilities featured on the Portal and how they were used by the
members of the Working Group.
Document Library Collaboration space where members posted, reviewed, and edited
documents.
Forum Open space to exchange and share various types of information
regarding their activities and discussions. Committee members posted
questions, suggestions, and comments by creating new forum topics, or
responding to existing posts by leaving comments.
Calendar Central location where all relevant meetings and events were
announced. Members could track upcoming meetings and events.
Links Location where external internet links pertinent to CSRIC were posted.
Table 2 – Portal Capabilities
Page 10 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
From its inception, the portal became a useful tool for the Working Group as they shared ideas,
resources, and collaborated on common documents, including this final report. Given the
disparate locations from which the group members originated, having an online collaboration
tool was instrumental to the successful completion of the Working Group’s final product.
4 Background
4.1 Current Alerting Activities and Components
Public alerting is conducted to ensure public safety. The public alerting systems described in
this document are part of this nation's larger alerting network. Social scientists and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) post-storm studies strongly suggest that alert
recipients don't often take decisive lifesaving action until the recipient validate the threat via
multiple trusted sources. Thus, each system may have its advantages and disadvantages, but
they are all complementary from a social science and public safety perspective. As technology
evolves, continuous improvements to public alerting systems are necessary to ensure the general
public is most informed about the threat described in the alert and so that appropriate action is
taken in response to the alert.
4.1.1 Alert Activity Chain
A brief review of current methodologies provides a needed framework to understand various
challenges presented by alerts and warnings. Figure 2 shows an alert activity chain that depicts
the activities involved in transmitting an emergency alert/warning from the Alert Originator (i.e.,
the Emergency Manager) to the Alert Recipient (typically a citizen within the targeted
community). This activity chain establishes (i) a framework for understanding how alerts are
generated in a conventional manner, to assist in the analysis of next-generation alerting, as well
as (ii) some of the terminology that will be used in that analysis.
Figure 2 – Alert Activity Chain

Figure 3 shows the envisioned general-purpose architecture for next-generation alerts.
Figure 3 – Envisioned General-Purpose Architecture for Next-Generation Alerts
The set of Alert Aggregators need not be a flat structure. It can be hierarchical as illustrated in
Figure 4.
Figure 4 – Alert Aggregators
4.1.2 Current Example of an Alerting Architecture
Page 12 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
Figure 5 – IPAWS Architecture
The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), whose architectural organization is
shown in Figure 5, is an emergency warning system currently overseen by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It allows emergency managers and other alerting
officials at the Federal, State, Territorial, Tribal and Local level to originate a single message
and transmit it via several alert disseminators. It uses a single aggregator as a transport
platform and the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) standard to ensure system compatibility. A
message is originated on the left-hand side of the illustration, processed through the alert
aggregator, and disseminated over the multiple methods on the right. The concept allows the
use of existing technologies that state and local governments may already have, as well as
leaving the door open for the development of future technologies.
IPAWS is used here as an example only. It is not the intent of this report to improve or
redesign the current system, but to show how the architectural organization described above can
be and has been put to use in an actual system.
4.2 Challenges of Existing Systems
There are many limitations and constraints on existing systems. For brevity, we will use the
IPAWS model to highlight issues common to existing technologies.
4.2.1 What limitations exist in the IPAWS Network that effect In-Field Operations?
Page 13 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
1. Reliability/Resilience: The most common limitation for existing systems is the risk that the
system may not function seamlessly, under all conditions. IPAWS and related systems are
subject to natural (wind, flooding, fire, cold and earthquakes) and human caused (acts of
war, terrorist and cyber attaches) events which could interrupt the ability to send and deliver
alerts. In evaluating the proposed functionality and mission critical nature of the
CAP/IPAWS system, it is believed that the server facility should be designed with minimal
points of failure. Current systems have no “industry standard” and no Federal or State
regulation. No hardware certification process, other than CAP recommendations, governs
manufacturers and no third party testing facility exists to enforce standards once fully
developed.
2. Alert Verification: As the current CAP/IPAWS system is a “pull” only configuration, there
is no verification method incorporated in the data stream, which results in an operational
limitation. The EAS client needs a “check-and-balance” audit system to verify alert status.
No process exists to create audit trails that allow the alert initiator to verify whether alerts
have been sent.
3. Adherence to industry standards: It is important that all external network interfaces adhere
to industry standards In order to allow the utilization of standardized hardware, and to ensure
the longest life cycle of the network. No program exists that encourages continued
maintenance of products and product developments as capabilities expand.
4. Geographically targeting specific areas: Some alerting systems which receive their alerts
from IPAWS are unable to limit the geo-targeting of the alert to the actual threat area defined
in the CAP message (alert areas in CAP may be defined by county, polygon, or circle). For
example, NOAA outlines the alert area by polygon which is often at the sub county level.
However, FCC regulations for CMAS only require alerts to be broadcast at the county level,
and some systems like IPAWS can target alerts to specific counties. Even then, certain
counties cover hundreds of thousand square miles. In these counties, it is not uncommon for
the actual alert area (e.g., Tornado Warning, Flash Flood Warning, etc.) to cover only a very
small fraction of the county. When such alerts are geo-targeted to an area well beyond the
actual threat area, they overreach the intended audience and subject many citizens to a false-
alarm syndrome. That is, citizens outside the actual alert area become de-sensitized and are
less likely to take lifesaving action in response to future alerts. Additionally, there are areas
throughout the nation which have limited access to alerts, such as some mountainous
locations and territorial waters.
5. Access and Functional Needs Community: Currently most systems lack the ability to
incorporate fully existing and emerging technologies for alerting the aged and disabilities
communities. The ability to handle external audio and video files is not defined. Additional
functionality is needed to ensure that these entire communities are alerted.
6. English as a second language: Currently most systems lack the ability to alert and warn
members of our population that do not speak English as a primary language. There is a need
to establish a process by which additional languages can be added at the point of message
origination, aggregation, or dissemination to translate the message.
Page 14 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
7. Enforceable hardware approval policy: The key to success of the CAP/IPAWS system is
standardization of network components. In order to guarantee this, the client hardware needs
to meet an established technical specification. There is a need for a defined policy which
will include specifications related to hardware requirements and what the current
certification represents. Hardware can include, but is not limited to, decoders, encoders and
edge devices.
8. Additional Operating Policies need to be created. Under the current IPAWS system,
message originators are required to take training and pass an exam on how to originate
effective alerts and warnings. But there are no requirements for this training or any other
certification for other existing or future systems purchased by state and local message
originators. Furthermore, no standards exist for such training.
4.2.2 Enhancements and Emerging Technology
4.2.2.1 Emerging Technologies
The most difficult tasks associated with emerging technologies are determining how to integrate
systems and technologies into existing systems effectively, and how to determine if out-of-date
systems need to be discarded for more effective solutions. The following are some dimensions
of these tasks.
1. How do we integrate future technology into existing systems?
Establish an on-going joint use taskforce consisting of both public and private participants that is
charged with keeping up with new technology and application development would help mitigate
these problems, so that planned enhancements to the current alert origination and distribution
networks will be available. Standards should be identified.
2. Working with Intellectual Property (patents)
Advancement in areas such as social media and geo-targeting can be handicapped by patent
holders and their unwillingness to allow patents to be utilized on a fair reasonable and non-
discriminatory arrangement. The use of Standards and Accredited Standards organizations
which have an appropriate intellectual property policy may assist in this issue.
3. What network technologies will possibly converge?
Convergence will occur as technology continues to mature and develop, and a process or policy
needs to be in place to minimize alert duplications and confusion by the end users. Procedures
must be developed for managing changes, eliminating multiple or duplicate alerts and providing
for prioritization of alert data.
4. What technical standards can be added or enforced to maximize efforts?
There are currently multiple on-going technical standards efforts related to the communication
of alerts and warnings. These efforts should be studied and their recommendations incorporated
into future systems to the extent that they articulate best practices or constructive advances.
OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) maintains the
Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) within the Emergency Data eXchange Language (EDXL) set
of standards. The Emergency Management CAP Sub Committee is responsible for the ongoing
Page 15 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
management of the CAP standard and related work. See: https://www.oasis-
open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=emergency-cap.
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Authority-to-Citizens Alerts (ATOCA) Working
Group is working on a draft document that “provides terminology, requirements and an
architectural description for protocols exchanging alerts between IP-based end points”. See:
http://tools.ietf.org/wg/atoca/charters.
The Alliance for Telecommunication Industry Solutions (ATIS) and Telecommunications
Industry Association (TIA) are both accredited by the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) as standards developing bodies and are jointly working on interface standards for alerts
and warnings to cellular networks and devices.
Additionally, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), Open Geospatial Consortium
(OGC), European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) are working on standards and recommendations related to the
communications of alerts and warnings.
4.2.2.2 Enhancements and Additional Functionality
1. Presidential National Alert, Emergency Action Notification (EAN): IPAWS can currently
broadcast an EAN over EAS and send a Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) via CMAS that
informs that a Presidential Alert has been issued that citizens can hear the content of on radio
and TV stations. Other than EAS and CMAS via IPAWS, current technologies do not
support transmitting Presidential National Alerts over multiple alerting systems. Future
systems must correct this problem by aggregating alerts over all alerting systems.
Alternate languages: As requested by the Presidential Executive Order 13407 (Section IV), a
method should be incorporated in to the CAP/IPAWS system that allows for a modular approach
when support for additional languages is required. IPAWS (which uses the OASIS Common
Alerting Protocol, Version 1.2, with additional constraints defined in Common Alerting Protocol,
v.1.2 USA Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Profile Version 1.0) includes the capacity to
receive and pass on alerts in multiple languages using additional <info> blocks in a CAP message
per the specifications. The rules for EAS allow for a station to broadcast alerts in the primary
language of the EAS Participant and there has been some support for this capability to be present in
CAP enabled EAS equipment. This initial capability is dependent upon the generator of the alert
supply alternate or multiple language information in the CAP message and the participating EAS
station to have equipment configured to read the CAP message, chose the alternate language, and
broadcast the additional language content provided.
2. Individuals with disabilities and/or certain effects of old age: Establish what is needed to
compensate for or reduce the limitations of these conditions in relation to being aware of and
comprehending alerts. Establish support for audio, video, and text media. Establish
procedures for ensuring that the information presented in all available media is consistent
and intelligible. Establish contingencies for situations when media types are missing, or are
unsupported by the available technology. Establish what is needed to ensure that the devices,
Page 16 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
through which alerts are received, are accessible, available, and affordable to people with
diminished sensory capabilities or other disabilities.
For example, not all members of the blind community have phone accessibility; in fact, there
are very few devices in that market that meets this group’s needs. If one is blind and
receives an alert through TV or video, or if one is deaf and receives an alert through radio,
the device must actually display the textual component of the alert, such as captions. With
EAS today, one needs to buy a special radio that displays the alert code, and such a radio is
not in widespread use. In other cases, the required equipment can be very expensive. If one
has a motor disability, one needs an alert receiver device that doesn’t require much dexterity
to use.
There is precedent at the FCC for taking steps to address these considerations, including
the following:
• The National Deaf-Blind Equipment Distribution Program, which started in July
2012 and is overseen by the FCC, and which ensures that the deaf-blind community
can afford the equipment they need to participate in telecommunications
• Section 717 of the CVAA concerning phone accessibility for people who are blind or
have low-vision.
• Section 203 of the CVAA, which addresses captions on small devices and hearing
aid compatibility of phones, to ensure their suitability for persons with impaired
hearing.
3. Specialized: Large Public Gatherings including campuses, business enterprises/facilities,
stadiums, etc. present special circumstances for providing alerts to many people at a single
venue, such as the benefit of alerting all persons at the same time, so as to facilitate an
appropriate and coordinated responsive action from the entire group Additional
functionality should be added to the alert at the origination and/or distribution network to
enable the support of such special challenges. Procedures and equipment are needed that
provide mobile and flexible solutions in these cases – for example, public address systems at
such venues that can transmit alerts with reduced human interaction.
4. Standardize: The “look-and-feel” of alphanumeric alert content must be consistent. As
devices capable of receiving and notifying the public of an alert increase in number and type,
consideration should be given to establishing an alert template that will structure the alert
content, thereby minimizing confusion to the public when an alert is received. A
standardized template for emergency managers would minimize the possibility of confusion
on the part of the alert message recipient by standardizing the form of the message that the
public receives, regardless of the alert distribution network or device used.
5. “Polling” (pull) versus “Push” technology: Consideration should be given to looking at the
overall data flow configuration. Evaluate expected network traffic with a focus on the
potential enhancements and determine whether “pull vs. push” technique is robust enough
for the future needs.
Page 17 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
An example of a client “PULL” communication model is where the client is responsible for
getting the most up-to-date information, or initiating the communication to the server. The
PUSH model of communication is becoming very popular for real time data such as EAS
Alerts. When the information must be delivered in real time, only the server knows when
the information becomes available. The server must “PUSH” the data to the client even
though the client is not polling for them.
Figure 6 – Poll (pull) Data Illustration
Frequent pulling (polling) can turn into a scaling problem when many concurrent users try
to capture all updates when they occur.
Figure 7 – Push Data Illustration
The push-based architecture illustrates an improved approach. First, an initial subscribe
request is issued. This contains a query and a (client) owner address. The query is
equivalent to a pull request, but can contain push-specific preferences such as pull-
frequency or delivery at specific times or rates. Next, the wrapper is activated, which pushes
updates whenever they happen or exactly when the user wants them delivered.
6. Expansion/modernization capability: As the State and local governments start to understand
the benefits of a standardized system like CAP/IPAWS, they may want to establish their own
CAP/IPAWS servers. If guidelines for designing such systems are created, then the process
of establishing State and local CAP/IPAWS server systems will proceed with greater
efficiency. There must be a method to establish local network solutions from a standard
model that incorporate distributed local servers, to create network operational tools that
enable better network management and interface to the National Server.

Final Report March 2013
Figure 8 – Expansion Illustration
7. 3rd party enhancements: Guidelines must establish best practices and interface requirements
for 3rd party providers that want to incorporate an alert relay in to their services. A method
to provide additional data relevant to the subject of the alert that alert initiator or application
developers can access to enhance the end-user’s experience is needed. An example would
be providing web URLs connecting to video, audio or data files about the circumstances that
prompted the alert or about the response to those circumstances over time. Security issues
regarding the URLs and trusted information source must also be addressed. IPAWS includes
the capacity to receive and pass on alerts containing URLs using additional <info> blocks as
specified in the CAP standard and IPAWS CAP specification This capability is dependent upon
the generator of the alert supplying the URL in the CAP message and the alert distributing
device or network having the capability to make use the URL.

8. Techniques for geo-targeting an alert to a specific area impacted: As the introduction of
GPS handheld devices and mapping software improvements, it has become possible to
provide more granular resolution as to the geographic area to which the alert should be
addressed. Social scientists and NOAA/NWS Service Assessments have concluded that the
general public responds to alerts when they feel the alert is relevant and they’ve received the
alert from multiple trusted sources. Warning effectiveness can be greatly increased by geo-
targeting the alert to the actual threat area. The converse is also true, in that poor geo-
targeting of alerts can result in a false-alarm syndrome where the public becomes de-
sensitized to future alerts. Polygon-based warnings can be created using alert origination
software which allows the alert author to outline the alert area by connecting multiple points.
According to NOAA (see http://www.nws.noaa.gov/sbwarnings), polygon-based warnings
can reduce warned area by 70% to 97%, especially in the larger counties of the Western
U.S.; see figure 10.
9. Also, current hazard prediction models can identify potentially affected areas based on
weather conditions and the expected spill or hazard. From this, they can produce a
downwind hazard message. Technology development should be encouraged to allow the
identification of affected areas and the automatic transmission of a warning message without
the intervention of the alert originator.

4.3.3 Description of Technology and Limitations
1. Off-Air Radio Broadcast (Analog): This technology is utilized as a broadcast medium,
therefore it would not be considered practical for providing the geo-targeting needed for
customized alerts intended for persons in limited areas. In broadcasting, all alerts are sent to
every tuned receiver in the reception area, limited by only transmitter power and terrain
(except in the case of FM Radio Subcarrier alerting for RDS and HD Radio, whereby the
broadcast medium has an ability to wake up and address the receiver with targeted alerts).
Generally, broadcast technology might be considered the most robust because of its ability to
do complex multimedia distribution of voice and data. Congestion is not an issue in a
broadcast medium.
2. Off-Air Television (Broadcast): This technology is utilized as a broadcast medium, and the
analysis is the same as for radio broadcasting.
3. Off-Air Digital Television, utilizing the Mobile DTV (MDTV) technology already deployed
at over 130 U.S. television stations, can support geo-targeting. Utilizing an MDTV
application called Mobile EAS; CAP geocodes can be pushed over broadcast Mobile DTV to
an MDTV-enabled cellphone, tablet or other mobile device. The MDTV receiver can
compare the alert geocodes to user configurable geo-location information and determine if
the user should be notified of the alert. The alert geocodes can also be used to overlay the
alert area on the device's built-in maps and provide additional rich media related to the
warning. Portions of the text content in the CAP message can also be displayed.
4. Tele-Communications (Plain Old Telephone, POTS): This technology has several
limitations; one being it is considered a “tethered” distribution medium. It does have one
excellent attribute in that it can utilize geo-targeting information effectively (Reverse
911TM), allowing for advanced customization of the alerts received by the end-user.
Congestion may be an issue.
5. MVPD Services: This technology primarily utilizes a tethered medium. With the
advancements in MVPD system technologies, limited wireless (Wi-Fi) capabilities are now
also being deployed. Theoretically, currently deployed technology may be capable of limited
geo-targeted alerts; however, billing and operational support systems are not designed to
support this type of information distribution.
Page 23 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
6. Tele-Communications Mobile Phones/Smartphones: This technology is being recognized as
the possible emerging leader in providing the most flexible distribution network when it
comes to allowing the end-user the ability to utilize both pubic alerting (CMAS). CMAS is
limited to 90 text characters and is a hybrid-broadcast form of RF distribution, in that it
sends the alert to a geo-located cell site and the alert is broadcast from there. This provides
for the effective geo-targeting of the alert. For SMS, email, or other subscription based alert
distributions, congestion may be an issue for the private alerting services.
7. CMAS could take advantage of broadcast technology improvements and be enhanced to
support an improved filtering ability in the handset, utilizing, for example GPS. This would
further improve the geo-targeting of the alert to the end-user.
8. Satellite Transmission (MVPD and Broadcast), (ST-ISP): Utilizing satellite RF
communications causes this type of technology to be a niche solution. It is considered a
tethered network with limited or no up-stream capabilities. Primary mode of operation is
broadcast on the downstream, limiting its geo-targeting capabilities. However, combining a
satellite receiver and GPS in common devices, Satellite broadcast becomes a highly effective
geo-targeted alert system with territorial coverage, no limit on alert capacity, geo fencing,
and maintaining alert delivery during most conditions.
9. Mobile Applications: Hundreds of free and fee-based mobile apps have emerged for public
alerting. According to a survey conducted by the American Red Cross (see
http://www.redcross.org/news/press-release/More-Americans-Using-Mobile-Apps-in-
Emergencies), mobile apps now tie social media as the fourth-most popular way to get
information in an emergency, following TV, radio and online news. The Red Cross survey
found that 20 percent of Americans said they have gotten some kind of emergency
information from an app, including emergency apps, those sponsored by news outlets and
privately developed apps. Some developers of mobile alerting apps get their content from
official and timely sources, such as IPAWS and NOAA feeds. Other developers may
"scrape" content from official or unofficial web pages which are less reliable and less timely
than through official feeds. Federal and/or industry programs could be established to certify
mobile apps which obtain information from official sources. Such programs might be
optional for mobile app developers, but a "seal of approval" from the program could be used
to encourage participation.
4.3.4 Future Dissemination Technologies
The members of WG2 wanted to avoid the exercise of predicting specific alert dissemination
technologies within next-generation alerting. However, three dissemination technologies loom
large, making them worth highlighting in this report:
1. CMAS: Technically, CMAS is not a future alert dissemination technology, because it was
already launched in 2012. However, aspects of CMAS are still in development and could
therefore be modified to take into account elements of next-generation systems. Many of the
technical parameters of CMAS are governed by FCC rules (47 CFR Part 10), which
themselves were formulated based on the recommendations of the FCC’s Commercial
Mobile Service Alert Advisory Committee (CMSAAC), a body made up of technical
Page 24 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
experts. CMSAAC completed the bulk of its advisory work by 2007, before the advent of
the smartphone as it is known today. CMSAAC envisioned CMAS to be a “bell-ringer” or
source of initial information about the subject of an alert, making the ninety-character limit
on message lengths quite acceptable. However, as the emergency management community
became more aware of CMAS and the smartphone industry advanced over the last couple
years, many have expressed dissatisfaction with the ninety-character limitation. Many also
feel that CMAS’s geo-targeting capability should be more precise. Emergency managers
now are viewing CMAS through the lens of a revolutionized mobile device market that is
dominated by smartphones and sophisticated mobile apps.
2. Broadband Alerting: Broadband Alerting was specifically mentioned in FCC’s 2010
National Broadband Plan as medium that can provide the public with new ways receiving
emergency information. However as detailed in Appendix F, one of the main challenges to
encouraging/promoting Broadband Alerting technologies is the lack of a clear definition of
Broadband Alerts. Appendix F lists several technologies, some of which are present today,
that arguably qualify as Broadband alerting technologies.
3. Mobile Emergency Alert System: The new Mobile Emergency Alert System (described
further in Section 5.1.2 below) is designed to leverage mobile digital TV broadcasting to
deliver reliable, rich media alerts anywhere, anytime. Mobile digital TV broadcasting
enables consumers to watch live television on their laptops, smart phones and other mobile
devices, using an existing broadcast signal and without using the bandwidth of wireless
providers. Mobile digital TV broadcasting remains nascent in the U.S., and the degree to
which the Mobile Emergency Alert System will be prevalent is highly correlated with the
future penetration of Mobile digital TV broadcasting in the U.S. market.
5 Architectures Development Opportunities
5.1 Standards, Protocols, Policies and Procedures
5.1.1 Authorization and Authentication of Alert Originators
It is important that only authorized individuals/organizations be able to send out emergency
alerts to the public. Across the country, there are thousands of federal, state, local, and tribal
governmental entities with designated individuals or organizations that would be entitled to send
out emergency alerts under the authority of the respective government(s). Additionally, there
are non-governmental individuals and organizations (such as day-care providers and chemical
plant safety officials) that are able to send alerts over private networks owned or controlled by
such persons or entities. While these individuals and organizations have no authority to transmit
alerts on behalf of the government, some would urge that they should be able to send out alerts
to concerned citizens.
In the cases above, the potential audience for the alert needs to be commensurate with the
jurisdiction and/or the scope of the responsibilities of the Alert Originator; while allowing the
possibility of escalating the alert. For example, a county emergency manager need not have the
authority to send out an alert to the entire state, but if deemed necessary, he or she can contact
the state emergency manager (preferably through a hotline) to send out an alert across the state.
Ensuring that only authorized individuals send out alerts is a multi-step process, which includes
Page 25 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
at the least the following elements:
• A priori verification of identity, responsibilities and jurisdictional authority – this step is
probably easier to execute for government officials/organizations than for non-
governmental entities/individuals.
• Determination of alerting-powers parameters e.g., geographic scope and access to certain
dissemination channels such as EAS.
• Issuance of authentication credentials.
• Real-time verification of authentication credentials and adherence to alerting-powers
parameters.
It would be a monumental task for a centralized office/program to perform all of the steps above.
5.1.2 Recent Innovation in Alert Dissemination Technologies
Other than CMAS, new AD technologies in recent years (e.g., SMS alerts) have primarily been
commercially driven (i.e., for profit). However, as demonstrated by the CMAS example, not all
society-benefiting alerting technologies will emerge via entrepreneurial forces alone.
Governmental shaping and intervention is probably needed more if the goal is to deploy the new
AD technology nationwide. This is again demonstrated by the contrast of the CMAS example
(which is heading towards comprehensive nationwide deployment) vs. the SMS example (which
has been used in limited or isolated locations).
Since certain systems need licenses, the federal government can rely on regulation to shape the
deployment and use of such systems, but this is not the only path. As one alternative,
participation in CMAS by wireless service providers is voluntary, although nonparticipating
providers are required to post a notice of nonparticipation at each point-of-sale and to give a
similar notice to the provider’s existing customers.
The Mobile Emergency Alert System (Mobile EAS or M-EAS), nearing final standards adoption
by ATSC, rides on top of the broadcast Mobile DTV signal to provide alert and warning. It
combines the reach and bandwidth of broadcasting with the immediacy of mobile
communications. Geo-targeting is an integral part of Mobile EAS, as is the ability to
simultaneously deliver alerts and rich-media content to an infinite number of receiving devices
in a signal coverage area. M-EAS is delivered to mobile devices independently of the cellular
network, which can dramatically increase the reliability of mobile alerting, provided that citizens
in the targeted area have devices capable of receiving the MEAS broadcast. Although it has
been discussed, the M-EAS architecture and demonstrations to date have not shown the use of
CAP based alert messages or integration with a CAP aggregator such as IPAWS.
After a successful pilot project, a number of broadcasters plan to begin operational deployment
of M-EAS in the second quarter of 2013. However, mass deployment of M-EAS depends upon
inclusion of Mobile DTV tuners in mobile devices. This may be a policy area that the FCC
should examine closely with the goal of formulating policies that could spur development.
Page 26 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
At least one industry participant leverages online advertising technology to receive and transmit
detailed information about emergencies to Internet browser display space used for advertising.
However, there is a cost associated with each alert pushed to the display space as it relies on
advertising and pop-up/ad blockers can preclude the alerts from being displayed.
A representative of this industry participant describes the service as follows: Numerous
websites already have browser display space embedded in them. Internet banner display
network technology allows real-time geo-targeted dynamic messaging through the existing
Internet browser in desktop and mobile devices and can utilize advertising technology to target
the user in the impacted area. The underlying technology has improved over the past five years.
Real time advertising bidding (RTB) can bid, like an auction, in real time on geo-targeted user
impressions through the browser on behalf of advertisers. Thus, emergency messages can
interrupt online display advertising on a specific web page being visited by a person in the threat
area. The technology is only triggered when a person opens a browser on a website when it has
display space for advertising. Technology can create the warning message within milliseconds
through dynamic rendering technology to produce alert banners that are standard sizes as
determined by the online advertising industry. When the user clicks on the emergency banner,
the user is taken to the full details of the alert. In the case of a Presidential message or any other
category of alerts given priority, the technology could be used to interrupt online advertising
nationwide and display the message.
5.1.3 Assumption of CAP Data Format
The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) has emerged as the dominant data format for exchanging
digital public warnings and emergencies between disparate alerting technologies. It is based on
the Extensible Markup Language (XML). The effort of creating the CAP specification began in
2001 by a group of 100+ independent emergency managers. Eventually the development of the
standard was formalized via the OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured
Information Standards) standards process, while continuing to involve a large number of subject
matter experts from various stakeholders in the emergency alerting community.
Given the genesis and the long history of the CAP specification’s development, it is reasonable
to assume that it captures the needs of the alerting community to a large extent, and that starting
a competing specification would entail a fair amount of wheel reinvention. As alerting
technologies, communication technologies and communication devices evolve, it is unlikely that
CAP in its current format will satisfy all the needs of the emergency alerting community – it
needs to continually evolve to keep up with those needs.
5.1.4 Support of New Data Types in CAP
Although based on XML, the extensibility of the CAP standard (Common Alerting Protocol
Version 1.2, OASIS Standard dated 01 July 2010) and the specification for interoperation with
IPAWS (CAPv1.2 USA IPAWS Profile v1.0) is limited by the standard and specifications. For
example, the IPAWS Profile specification restricts CAP to a defined set of fields that can be
used in the message and further restricts the type of content that can be contained in some fields
(e.g. IPAWS restricts the number of vertices in a polygon to 100). While these restrictions
Page 27 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
create an easy environment for interoperation between many systems and vendor products, they
may also limit creativity of the alert and warning vendor community. As technologies advance,
a need may arise for new data elements in the CAP message which may require using a formal
standards process to socialize, develop consensus, and provide configuration management of the
standards interfaces. Standards processes can become lengthy and resource consuming delaying
rapid deployment of new technologies..
5.1.5 Emergence of Profiles under CAP
Depending on the nature of the emergency, emergency managers may see fit to restrict the
dissemination of the alert over specific service types (EAS, CMAS, NOAA Weather Radio,
sirens, highway signs, etc.) The current CAP standard and the IPAWS implementation provides
managers with that flexibility. Specification of particular AD channels may also be useful
during tests, e.g., an emergency manager may be interested in testing CMAS only.
If an emergency manager wants to disseminate the alert over sirens, then the manager may be
required to waste valuable time, essentially, in populating required fields in the alert messaging
template that are irrelevant to sirens. A profile is a narrowing of the larger standard – one reason
for creation is to meet practical requirements of a sub-group employing the standard. In the case
of CAP, one popular profile that has emerged is the IPAWS profile, which has been largely
dictated by the IPAWS-OPEN AA’s objective of meeting the needs of its two biggest user
groups namely EAS and CMAS.
Other CAP profiles have emerged (Canada has finalized and Australia is developing CAP
profiles through the OASIS process). IPAWS and the equivalent Canadian system have
developed an interface to exchange CAP messages in each other’s profiles. It is possible that an
industry group could creating their own profile without going through OASIS (which is not a
requirement for creating profiles) which could result in competing systems that do not
interoperate. However, a vendor who does so would limit their market to only users that buy
and use their system end-to-end. Extensibility does not solve all the issues – in some cases one
profile could mandates a data element that is optional in another, creating an interoperability
problem.
One way of handling the issue of a profile-mandated element was enhancing CAP specification
to enhance CAP’s error message to be able to transmit “soft errors” whereby an AA or an AD
can indicate to the AO (a) that their CAP message does not adhere to a specific profile required
by the AD, and (b) how to rectify the CAP message.
5.1.6 Widespread CAP Adoption Including States/Local/Tribal Governments
State/local/tribal governments are major “users” of alerting systems – indeed they were the
earliest customers of alerting technologies, and therefore many of them have legacy stovepipe
systems that do not use the CAP data format. If the goal is to standardize the format of the alert
origination message, then States having their own data formats, greatly weaken the CAP
specification. Also if States do not use CAP (or the IPAWS profile of CAP), then they cannot
utilize FEMA’s alerting gateway, which implies that their citizens would be denied both CMAS
alerts and CAP EAS alerts from those governments.
Page 28 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
The goal of CAP is to be the one standard for alert messages – this comes at the expense of
having a large number of fields. If a large number of fields needs to be populated for the
message to be valid, then this can be overbearing for emergency managers (who are presumably
originating the alert under duress), even with the aid of automation. This could lead to lower
popularity of CAP.
5.1.7 Impact of IPAWS-OPEN on CAP Reputation
Assuming CAP is the desired data format standard for alert messages, its success may be
impacted by the reputation of IPAWS-OPEN. Since CAP is most heavily used in conjunction
with IPAWS Gateway, any weaknesses in IPAWS-OPEN may reflect poorly on CAP, lessening
its appeal. With private sector companies creating their own alert aggregators, the perception of
IPAWS may suffer. Even so, the United States Department of Defense, Canada and Australia
have officially adopted CAP and are implementing alert and warning systems to receive and
distribute CAP messages. The European Union and several member countries are investigating
the use of CAP for exchange of alert and warning information.
IPAWS-OPEN is currently maintained by FEMA, which does not include enterprise data
services as one of its core mission functions. The current implementation of IPAWS-OPEN in
FEMA datacenters has some perceived weaknesses including reliability, security and scalability.
Other perceived weaknesses include the process of interconnecting with it (for AOs and ADs).
Perhaps moving the development and maintenance of IPAWS-OPEN to another DHS
component or other government agency that has data services as a core mission and capability
would help to alleviate these perceptions.
An additional weakness is the perception that FEMA-IPAWS does not rigorously enforce the
CAP specification. Several AOs vendors upload sub-compliant alert messages to see if they
would be accepted and transmitted by the system, and in some instances they were.
Another weakness is the uncertainty in continued FEMA funding for IPAWS-OPEN, which
means less trust in IPAWS-OPEN being maintained and upgraded to the standards and service
levels that would be expected in the private sector. Among desired new features are stronger
middleware for handling multiple profiles and validating that a received message adheres to the
requirements of individual profiles.
Although a federated architecture (see Figure 3 for an example) allows for multiple AAs, it is
important that there be a federal government-connected AA. Public safety officials would not
want to rely on an aggregation service with an inherently uncertain economic model, little or no
oversight, and few or no contracts in effect (i.e., these third parties could discontinue service at
their discretion, leaving a public warning gap).
If it is deemed beneficial to outsource the operation and maintenance of IPAWS-OPEN to one or
more private-sector entities, then it can be done with heavy oversight and reporting
requirements, as was the case with outsourcing wireless number portability operations to
Neustar.

Final Report March 2013
5.1.8 Limited Incentive to Adopt CAP
Assuming CAP is the desired standard, there may be limited incentive for vendors and
emergency managers to incur the costs in equipment, inspections, and manpower to implement
CAP-compliant capabilities. Even if CAP is not the desired standard, it is likely that the
championed data format will experience the same phenomenon.
Some vendors of origination tools claim to be CAP compliant but are not really. (Some are
compliant only with an earlier version of CAP, while other origination tools claim “compliance”
but produce CAP messages with seemingly loose interpretations of the standard. Some vendors
support CAP in only part of their product interface. A standard must be enforced. Even FEMA-
IPAWS does not enforce the standard fully. Some vendors attempt to upload non-compliant
messages to FEMA-IPAWS to see if they “stick.”
5.1.9 Multimedia Alerts
Multimedia alerts by definition present the alert in multiple formats. This is beneficial as a way
to mitigate the risk of one format not being understood by the AR, e.g., by people with
disabilities or by non-English speakers.
Social scientists suggest that alert recipients don't often take decisive lifesaving action until the
recipient receives reinforcing information. Multimedia alerts by definition present the alert in
multiple formats. Thus, they are beneficial as way to personalize the alert, so that it is
internalized by the recipient, information is reinforced, and the recipient is more likely to take
lifesaving action. Providing alerts in multimedia formats can provide accessibility for people
with disabilities and non-English speakers.
However, there are feasible alternatives to enhance public safety even when bandwidth poses
limitations. For example, CMAS could conceivably broadcast the alert geo-codes to the mobile
device and compare it against location based information from the device (i.e., the user's
location) and/or user configurable geo-location information on the device to determine if the
user should be notified of the alert. The alert geo-codes can also be used to overlay the alert area
and other information from CAP messages (e.g., storm location and projected path for
tornadoes) on devices with built-in maps.
Another potential alternative where available bandwidth poses limitations is to mitigate the
effects of network congestion by making use of a device's built-in features to provide richer
content. This would be possible where the user’s device would already contain some of the
reinforcing information that the user would have otherwise sought following receipt of a text-
only alert.
Alerts may consist of several components including text, text for CMAS, audio-visual
information, etc. Multimedia components of alerts likely have high bandwidth requirements,
and may therefore not be appropriate for systems where congestion may occur. One of the
advantages of a system such as Mobile EAS is that it is designed to easily handle simultaneous
transmission of multimedia assets as part of its CAP-profile alerts. Mobile EAS from television
broadcasters allocates relatively small amounts of spectrum (already allocated to the
broadcaster) to send multimedia alerts to an unlimited number of receive devices, but this
Page 30 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
technology has not been commercially deployed.
The multimedia bandwidth requirements are applicable to every form of transport the alert goes
through i.e., Alert Originator to Alert Aggregator, Alert Aggregator to Alert Disseminator, and
Alert Disseminator to Alert Recipient. Focusing on Alert Disseminators (ADs), not all
dissemination transport channels (dissemination channels) can handle that requirement:
• In some cases, ADs are inherently incapable of disseminating multimedia alerts e.g.,
pager networks, sirens.
• In other cases the capability changes with load conditions e.g., congestion in the case of
data/communication networks. Although wireless networks are obvious examples where
congestion can occur, it can also happen with wired networks. It is also possible that the
congestion has occurred due to people reacting to the emergency, e.g., picking up their
phones as soon as they hear about the emergency. The alert itself could start this
“snowball” effect. (It is for that reason that CMAS rules do not allow phone numbers or
URLs in the CMAS message.) It is also possible that congestion has occurred due to
reduced capacity of the network, such as if the emergency itself knocked out radio
towers, fiber/copper runs, or other facilities.
• For some ADs, the technology for handling multimedia alerts in a non-crippling manner
exists but is not widely deployed at present. For example, cellular providers can use a
multimedia broadcast technology (referred to as MBMS) that is similar to the cell
broadcast technology used for CMAS.
Most dissemination networks (e.g., TV/Radio, cellular) are not dedicated to alerts and do not
have a primary mission to be an alerting network. Alerting is secondary to the mission of
providing business-as-usual telecommunication/broadcasting services, even in times of disaster
and emergencies.
Upgrading an AD’s infrastructure to handle multimedia alerts in a manner that does not impact
the primary mission of the AD likely requires an extra investment by the AD – any financial
burden to the AD is a disincentive to making that investment; and the larger it is the bigger the
disincentive.
It would seem appropriate for ADs to have control over the decision of whether to carry/drop
high-bandwidth elements of alert over their dissemination channels to ensure that that the
primary mission of the AD’s infrastructure does not suffer.
5.1.10 AO/AA Need to Verify Message Dissemination
Alert Originators (AO) need to know which components of the alert were disseminated. This
includes knowing whether or not the multimedia component was disseminated. That knowledge
may help the AO anticipate public response and/or assess if the public has been sufficiently
alerted.
It may also be helpful to the Alert Aggregator (AA) to know which components of the alert were
disseminated, in order to forward that information to the AO. The Alert Disseminator (AD)
would need to provide that information to the AA/AO. This creates an extra burden on the AD.
Page 31 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
However, the act of providing feedback of similar information is already done in the case of
CMAS – some CMSPs provide feedback to IPAWS-Open (although currently this feedback is
only an acknowledgement that the alert was disseminated).
The burden is complicated by the fact that congestion levels vary, and therefore the ability of the
AD to disseminate the multimedia component may change over time. Providing real-time status
update from the AD to the AA/AO can be burdensome and costly.
5.1.11 No Clarity on Required Records
It is not clear if AAs and ADs need to (or should) maintain detailed records (e.g., logs,
operational measurements) on disseminated alerts, containing whatever information is available
to them. Such records may be needed for training, retrospective analysis, and/or legal purposes.
For example, the FCC may want to study these records to advise/control AOs who over-alert.
Should such records be required, it is not clear what level of detail would be required. For
example, do ADs need to have a second-by-second account of which multimedia components
were disseminated? The level-of-detail requirement could be overly burdensome and costly for
AAs/ADs. In the case of CMSPs, they may decide to disable all multimedia communication
from/to mobile devices (e.g., if citizens want to get local TV streams about the emergency event)
– should such a decision also be included in the alert record? The more information in the alert
record, the more burdensome it will be to ADs.
In addition it would be unclear where that record would be kept/stored and for how long, and
also what protocol would be used to govern how/when/to whom AAs/ADs provide those
records.
5.2 Platforms
5.2.1 Alert-Receiving Communication Devices
5.2.1.1 Introduction
The scope of this discussion will be limited to devices that require explicit user action to opt out
of receiving alerts. In other words, this analysis does not consider “opt-in” alert services where
the user could actively subscribe to alerts from a variety of web-enabled devices. Any device
with a Broadband or wireless Internet connection should, at some point in the future, receive
emergency alerts without requiring user action.
5.2.1.2 Common Characteristics of Next Generation Communication Devices
Ideally, from an ergonomic/functional standpoint, the devices need to have a graphic display
with storage, to allow for user replay of the messages at a later time, with clear indication of the
alert validity period. An application to display such messages would be appropriate for device
management of emergency alerts, but an embedded service could also suffice. The device must
also provide an attention-grabbing method to alert the user or resident, such as an audible tone,
vibratory action, or flashing indicator. Wherever possible, the ergonomic requirements defined
for mobile devices in the CMAS Mobile Device Behavior Specification J-STD-100, which was
jointly developed by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (“ATIS”) and the
Page 32 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
Telecommunications Industry Association (“TIA”) and defines a common set of requirements
for how CMAS-capable devices will behave upon receipt of a commercial mobile alert, should
be considered as a baseline specification for these new, currently unsupported, devices.
Additionally, the devices should allow for user configuration of alert types to be received,
similar to the procedures and data types discussed in Section 10 of J-STD-100. The devices
should support the ability to receive geo-targeted alerts. The details of the geo-targeting
mechanism are network dependent, and do NOT necessarily imply any location capability for
the device itself. The device does not need to acknowledge any alerts.
Examples of devices to which emergency alerts can be extended include desktop PCs, laptop
PCs, and Wi-Fi tablets. All of these devices have rich operating systems and application
development environments. Devices with limited visual output displays should also be
considered. These could be devices such as home alarms, a Blu-Ray players, set-top boxes, etc.,
provided that they have constant connectivity to an AD or AA through some access and
transport technology. Some of these devices normally operate in “Always On” mode (unlike a
PC or TV set), and thus may be able to alert the user at any time. One of the features being
considered for these devices by designers is a “wake up” capability, to justify sending alerts to
devices that may be in standby or sleep mode.
5.2.2 Aggregation Systems
5.2.2.1 Introduction
This is essentially a question around having one central alert aggregator vs. multiple entities
performing the alert aggregation functionality (see Appendix C). Should it be through one
source, as it has been traditionally, or should there be multiple ways an Alert Originator sends
out alerts? For example, can Google CRT’s aggregator and other potential Alert Aggregators
receive the same alert an Alert Originator sends to FEMA’s IPAWS-OPEN and in turn make it
available to Alert Disseminators, including the AA itself acting as an AD and sending the alert
out to its end-users?
5.2.2.2 Advantages of Single Aggregator
For nationwide coverage, the single aggregator is what is currently in place (there are reportedly
several state-level aggregators in use) in the form of IPAWS-OPEN, and for the most part seems
to be functioning at a high level and satisfying the needs of all players involved. Having a single
point of control with a technology is rare and something that should be retained unless there is
an overwhelming case made that progress is being held back.
Given the importance and the impact of how the public responds to emergency alerts, it is
beneficial to have a trusted single source for alerts, which helps manage the distribution of
information and prevent incorrect use (or misuse) of the alerting system. The single source for
alerts also provides some level of reduction in liability to private-sector providers of alert
dissemination networks and services.
Single point of control allows for a technology to be directed in an open standards-based
universe much more easily and provides a framework around which to encourage
Page 33 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
interoperability between vendors and alert and warning disseminators. It obviates the need for a
governmental body/program to oversee and manage multiple Alert Aggregators including
performing the following tasks:
• Certification
• Auditing
• Central directory for lookups
• Enforcement of service level requirements could be difficult
While having multiple aggregators offers systematic redundancy, it also creates multiple targets
for cyber-attacks, making the defense of the overall architecture more difficult. In addition,
having multiple aggregators may add complexity to the dissemination (e.g., coordination to
prevent multiple copies of the same alert over the same dissemination channel, possibly
resulting in missed alerts.
5.2.2.3 Disadvantages of Single Aggregator
Although the current configuration is operational, no effort has been made to define what is not
working today or what additional capabilities are lacking in the current setup.
With the system under a single entity’s control, the public safety alerting technologies are
subject to being held back by any bureaucracy present within that single entity. The single
aggregator may become too focused on traditional communication mediums while ignoring
cutting-edge technologies used by younger generations without proportionate/adequate
representation in the standards bodies.
If the single aggregator is physically a single server, then it will be an attractive target for cyber-
attacks that may render it inoperative. Even if the alert aggregator is physically implemented as a
network of redundant, load-balanced, mirrored servers, it will still present itself as a single
system to target for an attack.
If a technical failure (e.g., software bug) brings down the single aggregator (regardless if
physically a single server or a network of servers), then the overall architecture will experience
near-complete failure, as opposed to the partial degradation that would occur if multiple
aggregators were to be used.
A single AA implies a monopolistic provider of the AA service, which will not necessarily
respond the needs of AOs and ADs with the desired urgency. A single AA will have to handle
the entire load of certain labor and/or process intensive operations such as identity verification of
AOs. Having multiple AAs, especially if organized as a hierarchy mirroring local-state-federal
jurisdictional hierarchy, would result in distribution the load of such operations. In addition,
having a single AA likely prohibits the possibility of commercial for-profit Alert Aggregators,
which may be better, faster, and more efficient for ADs and AOs in certain respects.
5.3 Implementing New Dissemination Technologies on a National Alert Platform
5.3.1 Introduction
Page 34 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
This topic deals with the role that the FCC can play in easily and effectively bringing in new AD
technologies into the then-existing national alerting platform. Should there be an established
national alerting architecture serving next-generation alerting3 in the United States, it is likely
that the current FEMA Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) architecture will
be the basis of/template for it. Currently, FEMA IPAWS aggregator supports EAS
dissemination via-TV/Radio/cable/satellite broadcasting, the cellular broadcast (CMAS) and
NOAA weather radio dissemination channels. These alert dissemination technologies have been
implemented via a mixture of legislation, voluntary participation, funded and unfunded
mandates and FCC rulemaking to require adherence with an outcome consistent with the
IPAWS platform. Placeholders for Broadband, Wi-Fi, social networking and other yet-to-be
defined alert dissemination technologies are indicated in IPAWS’s general purpose architecture
diagram. IPAWS’s goal is to incorporate as many dissemination capabilities as possible in order
to provide maximum coverage for the US public and connection for the US citizen to timely and
accurate alert and warning information.
Given the presence and future plans of IPAWS, it is not clear that the FCC is the only federal
agency responsible for facilitating new alert dissemination technologies. It is possible that such
an initiative needs to be conducted jointly by the FCC and FEMA, potentially with involvement
by the National Weather Service and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
5.3.2 Objective
Assuming the FEMA IPAWS architecture to be the national alerting architecture, the objective
of this section is to identify mechanisms and challenges for adding new dissemination outlets to
the alert framework. This includes existing dissemination technologies that have not yet been
incorporated into the FEMA IPAWS platform, as well future alert dissemination technologies
that have yet to be invented/implemented/deployed.
5.3.3 Observations about Existing IPAWS-Supported Dissemination Technologies
The alert aggregator was defined and is operated by FEMA. Accordingly, FEMA dictates the
rules of operation and connectivity to which ADs must adhere. The dictation of
operation/connectivity of rules by a single entity has resulted in high degree of clarity about said
rules for ADs.
The FCC has reinforced FEMA’s efforts by writing rules that are consistent with FEMA’s rules,
e.g., CAP protocol requirement, behavior of broadcast technologies on the alerting network
edge, etc. Alert disseminators operate independently. The standards-setting process has been
developed along industry and technology lines. There have been few if any cross-industry or
cross-technology platforms. Industry finances the dissemination of alerts to the public.
Currently, there are no mechanisms for quantifying and measuring the success and societal
benefit of an alerting technology (either per occurrence or in general).
3 In this context, the term next-generation alerting does not refer to futuristic alert dissemination methods. Rather it
refers to the process, system and infrastructure through which the US public will receive emergency alert in the
future.
Page 35 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
5.3.4 Introducing New Alert Dissemination Technologies to the Public
Government pays for certain steps in the alerting activity chain (e.g., FEMA finances alert
aggregation; federal, state, and local government finances alert origination). However, in many
instances, citizens are still expected to purchase devices and services for receiving such alerts.
In most cases, such devices are purchased primarily for non-alerting purposes e.g., TV/Radio,
smartphones. In other cases, these devices are purchases specifically for alerting purposes e.g.,
NOAA weather radio.
One example of an exception would be the use of online advertising technology for alerting,
because it can be considered as already integrated into legacy devices such as an aged desktop
computer with Internet browser as well newer mobile devices which incorporate online
advertising.
Traditionally, the introduction and widespread deployment of a new alert dissemination
technology to the public has been more event-driven (i.e., in the aftermath of an event/incident)
than market-driven. For example, there was a significant increase in college-campus SMS
alerting in the aftermath of the 2006 Virginia Tech campus shooting.
Whether event-driven or market-driven, many AD technologies introduced in the last few years
are entrepreneurial or for-profit e.g., SMS alerts, ETN, certain smartphone apps. However, not
all society-benefiting AD technologies will emerge based on entrepreneurial basis – in some
cases governmental intervention is required/needed either via regulation (e.g., nationwide EAS)
or via encouragement and facilitation (e.g., CMAS).
Going forward, the existence of a federated architecture (IPAWS-OPEN architecture is at least
one example) will lower the barriers-to-entry for new alert dissemination technologies, for at
least two reasons:
• Vendors of said new technologies need not invest in building components for the entire
alert activity chain.
• Vendors of said new technologies would not be easily blocked out by entrenched
vendors of legacy stovepipe systems, whose existing closed alert-origination tools leave
little to no "shelf space" for said new-technology vendors' alert-origination tools.
5.4 Adherence to Four Components of Digital Security
The four components of digital security are authentication, authorization, integrity and privacy.
This topic also includes (a) investigating the process for authorizing alert originators and (b)
how to ensure that a received alert is real. There are several paths messages take, all of which
have security concerns:
• The message originator sends messages to some kind of message aggregator (like
IPAWS-OPEN). The message aggregator sends messages to various Alert Disseminators
(such as a wireless network operator). The AD delivers the alert message to citizens.
• In each step, there could be intermediaries who provide "fan-in"/"fan-out" services to
Page 36 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
keep the number of entities a given element needs to handle to a reasonable number. For
example, a network operator may have 2 or 3 levels of distribution to get a message to
the consumer.
Each of these paths needs security with at least authentication, integrity and privacy, and where
messages cross administrative boundaries, authorization decisions must be made.
IPAWS has implemented authentication and protection of message integrity using digital
signatures. IPAWS will only process alert messages that are digitally signed by the AO with a
certificate issued to the public safety organization by FEMA during the user registration process.
The digital certificate of the AO is maintained throughout the IPAWS distribution of the alert to
the distribution channels to ensure that the AO’s message integrity is maintained. Both NOAA
and participating CMAS wireless carriers validated message certificates before any alert is
distributed through their networks. FEMA strongly encourages all EAS participants to also
validate an alerts certificate before broadcasting the alert message.
5.5 User Opt-In/Opt-Out Control
In most circumstances, the targets of an alert are defined by geospatial relationships (affected
area). However, there are many circumstances where this is not sufficient. One is where the
target has no way to determine where it is, and geo-targeting would not work except on a
predetermined, relatively coarse level. Another example is where there is a desire for one entity
to get alerts geo-targeted to another entity. For example, a parent may wish to receive alerts
originally targeted to their child. There are also classes of alerts that should not be received by
an entity even if they are in the geo-targeted area. These may be low priority alerts. In all of
these cases, there is an explicit opt-in action taken by the target in advance of the alert.
6 Social Media Alerting
6.1 Variety of Social Media Categories
In the context of present-day social media (SM) alerting, most discussions revolve around two
particular Social Media Providers (SMPs), namely Facebook and Twitter. However, it is
important to note the world of SMPs is bigger than Facebook and Twitter and involves services
beyond social networking and micro-blogging.
One description of social media services that seems apt is the one used by Wikipedia, namely:
“Social Media includes web-based and mobile based technologies which are used to turn
communication into interactive dialogue between organizations, communities, and individuals.”
It is beyond the scope of WG2’s work to conduct a survey and an analysis of the complex SMP
market. However, it is important to bring attention to the relatively large number of existing
SMPs and the existence of different categories of SMPs. One approach for elucidating these
different categories of SMPs is provided in the table below. This identifies eight categories and
is not meant to be an exhaustive list of categories or SMPs:
Page 37 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
No. Category Description Examples Known Principally for that
Category4
1 Social Networking Interact by adding friends, commenting Facebook, Google+, MySpace,
on profiles, joining groups and having Foursquare, Hi5, Yahoo! Groups
discussions
2 Blogs / Microblogs Interact by exchanging small elements Twitter, Tumblr
of content such as short sentences,
individual images, or video links with
followers.
3 Content Communities Interact by sharing photos or videos and YouTube, Pinterest
commenting on user submissions.
4 Virtual Game Worlds Interact within an online community World of Warcraft, EverQuest
that takes the form of a computer-based
simulated environment through which
users can interact with one another and
use and create objects. Users typically
take the form of avatars visible to
others. Users are usually required to
follow strict rules that govern their
behavior, and often are not allowed to
engage in economic activities.
5 Virtual Social Worlds Interact within an online community Second Life, Twinity
that takes the form of a computer-based
simulated environment through which
users can interact with one another and
use and create objects. Users typically
take the form of avatars visible to
others. Users do not have any
restrictions on the way avatars can
behave or interact, including the
possibility of conducting
business/commerce with other users.
6 Collaborative Projects Interact by adding content and editing Wikipedia
existing content.
7 Social Bookmarking Interact by tagging websites and Del.icio.us, Blinklist, Simpy
searching through websites bookmarked
by other people.
8 Social News Interact by voting for articles and Digg, Propeller, Reddit
commenting on them.
Table 5 – Categories of Social Media Activities
It is important to note that while Facebook and Twitter are the most dominant forms of using
social media for alerting today, it is possible that emergency managers will find in the future
other forms of social media services that are equally or more effective in disseminating alerts.
4 Many Social Media Providers offer services that span multiple categories. For example, while Google+ is known
primarily as a social networking service it offers capabilities such as embedded YouTube feeds and collaborative
document creation. Therefore arguably Google+ also belongs in the Content Communities and the Collaborative
Projects categories. However, it is known primarily as a Social Networking service.
Page 38 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
6.1.1 Terminology
The terminology in this section is an extension of the terms already established in the previous
section, namely: Alert Originator (AO), Alert Aggregator (AA), and Alert Disseminator (AD).
Different social media providers have different names for similar if not equivalent entities. For
example, if someone establishes a social networking connection to another person on Facebook,
then the former is referred to as a friend of the latter. In the case of Google+, the former is
referred to as a member of a circle belonging to the latter. In the case of Twitter, the former is
referred to as a follower of the latter.
In order to facilitate the subsequent analysis, Working Group 2 uses the following definitions for
concepts/entities that may be common across different social media providers, but have different
names:
• Alerting Account: A social media account (e.g., on Facebook, Twitter, and/or Google+)
that is set up by a public safety official for the purpose of alerting the public in their
jurisdiction.
• Subscriber: Subscriber refers to a social media user who has signed up to receive alerts
from the alerting account. For example:
In the case of Facebook, it would be citizens who signed up as friends of the
o
emergency manager’s Facebook alerting account.
In the case of Twitter, it would be citizens who signed up as followers of the
o
emergency manager’s Twitter alerting account.
In the case of Google+, it would be citizens who signed up as a member of a circle
o
within the emergency manager’s alerting account.
6.1.2 Other Efforts Related to Social Media Alerting
The use of social media in emergency management has received significant attention, both
within and outside the public safety community. Here are some examples:
1. The Alerts and Warnings using Social Media (AWSM) Program within the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T).
Among other activities, the AWSM program sponsored a two-day workshop entitled
“Alerts and Warnings Using Social Media: Current Knowledge and Research Needs: A
Workshop” on February 28-29, 2012 at the Beckman Center, Huntington Room, Irvine,
CA. The workshop was organized by The National Academies. The full report on the
workshop is available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=15853.
2. A Congressional Research Service report entitled “Social Media and Disasters: Current
Uses, Future Options, and Policy Considerations” (authored by Bruce R. Lindsay);
published on September 6, 2011.
3. Social Media topic within AWARE Forum (http://www.awareforum.org/category/social-
media/) – AWARE is an independent forum that brings together thought leaders and
practitioners in the public safety and emergency management fields to share ideas,
discuss key insights, and learn about best practices in emergency alerts and warnings.
Sponsored by SRA International’s Strategy and Performance Group the purpose of
AWARE is to offer a source for information and rich discussion for SRA’s clients,
potential clients, and alerts and warnings stakeholders.
Page 39 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
4. A Department of Energy report entitled “Social Networking for Emergency Management
and Public Safety” (authored by AM Lesperance, MA Godinez, and JR Olson);
published in August 2010.
In addition, a relevant example of the use of Social Media in Emergency Management by the
American Red Cross is provided in detail in Appendix E.
6.1.3 Intervention of Social Media Providers in Delivering the Social Media Alerts
The only way of using social media alerting today entails emergency managers setting up
alerting accounts and trying to have as many subscribers as possible. In other words, the
alerting accounts are regular social media accounts that happen to be owned and operated by
emergency managers.
Today, Facebook and Twitter are the dominant social media platforms used for alerting. When
an incident occurs, the emergency manager posts a message on the alerting account for their
subscribers to view. This is no different from an average social media user posting a message
for their friends/followers/circle members to view.
In the future, it is possible for social media providers to treat emergency alerts as an exceptional
category of messages/posts and to intervene in order to ensure that the emergency alert message
is delivered to the intended audience with greater efficacy. This may include ensuring the fastest
possible delivery or higher priority in delivery, visual highlighting of the message to increase its
attention grabbing potential, etc.
Intervention by social media providers may also include plugging into an Alert Gateway (e.g.,
FEMAs IPAWS-OPEN), and upon detecting a new alert on the gateway, inserting the alert into
the Social Media User’s content (e.g., Facebook wall), potentially with geo-targeting as
discussed in section 6.1.9.
6.1.4 Social Media Alerting Opportunities
6.1.4.1 Training Emergency Managers
There should be a training program for emergency managers on the use of social media for
issuing alerts and warnings to the public. Preferably this training program should be approved
by an authoritative source, and publicized so that it becomes widely known as the go-to training
program for emergency managers.
6.1.4.2 Training Sources
Today, there are several providers that offer training in social media alerting including:
• FEMA: Recently began offering IS-42 Social Media in Emergency Management
(https://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/is42.asp)
• International Association of Emergency Managers: Typically have training seminars at
their conferences.
Page 40 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
• National Disaster Preparedness Training Center at the University of Hawaii: Offers a
touring course entitled “Social Media for Natural Disaster Response and Recovery” (see
https://ndptc.hawaii.edu/training/catalog/8).
Existing training providers can give valuable input on the creation of a comprehensive training
program based on their lessons-learned. Existing training courses can be converted into non-
overlapping modules within a comprehensive training program, such that existing training
providers have an incentive to contribute constructively to the creation of the comprehensive go-
to training program.
The comprehensive program may potentially be a mix of for-fee and free training modules.
6.1.4.3 Social Media’s Continuous Evolution
Social media is continuously changing. Change may be technological in nature, whereby an
existing social media provider adds new features/technologies to its offering. Change may also
be in the form of the arrival of a new popular social media service.
6.1.4.4 Emergency Managers’ Challenges
Emergency managers are short on time and financial resources. They cannot be expected to
attend multi-day training courses.
Differences in jurisdiction and local laws and procedures are also a challenge. According to a
recent finding reported during a program titled “Alerts and Warnings Using Social Media”
conducted by the Science and Technology Directorate of the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security, one-size solution approach does not fit all – different communities or jurisdictions
have different needs, technology comfort levels, expectations, etc.
Another challenge comes in the form of common barriers-to-adoption that are experienced or
interposed by Emergency Managers. Academic research points to several barriers to adoption of
social media alerting by emergency managers including:
• Fear of a new technology.
• Lack of internal policies governing the use of social media alerting.
• Lack of knowledge on how to use social media for alerts and warnings.
• Public expectation of being able to communicate directly with public safety officials
over alerting accounts.
6.1.5 Promoting & Funding of Innovative Tools that Enhance Social Media Alerting
6.1.5.1 Publicizing Strategic Vision
The FCC should encourage a unified strategic vision for value-added IT/Internet tools that
enhance the efficacy of social media alerting. In order for entrepreneurs, open-source software
developers, and other federal agencies to reinforce that strategic vision, it is important that the
vision be made available to the public in a clear and unambiguous fashion.
Page 41 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
6.1.5.2 Support of the Open-Source Developer Community
The open-source developer community has long provided freeware to computer users and
software developers. It is not uncommon for such freeware to be a substitute for commercial
software. The open-source developer community may provide free or low-cost substitute
IT/Internet tools for budget-limited Emergency Managers as well as IT/Internet tools with new
capabilities that address needs outlined in the strategic vision.
6.1.5.3 Limited Governmental R&D Funding
Some IT/Internet tools may be developed by entrepreneurs who are able to identify a profitable
business model. However, commercial profitability in the field of alerts and warnings has
traditionally been difficult. Tools may not be developed by the private sector, because such
development may not be anticipated to be profitable, or as being likely to achieve profitability
only after a long time – both cases are typically avoided by venture-capital funding.
Government R&D funding is generally required to support product development in such cases.
The DHS Science and Technology Directorate and the FCC have limited budgets for R&D of
alerting technologies. Other federal agencies concerned with public safety may be able to
provide such funding also.
6.1.6 Scope of Social Media Alerting
6.1.6.1 Coupling Social Media Alerting with Citizen Responses
One unique aspect about social media alerting is that issuing an alert automatically and
immediately sets up a two-way communication with citizens over the alert dissemination
medium – other dissemination channels that arguably exhibit this aspect are Emergency
Telephone Notification (ETN) e.g., Reverse 911(TM), and Email.
Issuing an alert over social media typically results in a large number of responsive incoming
messages from citizens. The more subscribers an emergency manager has, the more responsive
messages the manager is likely to receive.
According a survey conducted by the American Red Cross (see
http://www.redcross.org/news/press-release/More-Americans-Using-Mobile-Apps-in-
Emergencies ), "Three out of four Americans (76 percent) expect help in less than three hours of
posting a request on social media, up from 68 percent last year. Forty percent of those surveyed
said they would use social tools to tell others they are safe, up from 24 percent last year."
Whether or not emergency managers have the necessary resources to respond to citizens over
social media, there is a public expectation that they will.
The American Red Cross study demonstrates the general public's increasing engagement and
reliance on social media for emergency related communication.
6.1.6.2 Restricting Two-way Communications
It may be beneficial to restrict two-way communication on alerting accounts so that only
Page 42 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
emergency managers can post messages on them, thus controlling the content and limiting the
volume incoming messages traffic. However, such a limitation may hurt the ability of
emergency managers to attract subscribers.
Additionally, such a limitation prevents citizens from posting legitimate call-for-assistance
messages on alerting accounts. The net benefit/cost of restricting two-way communication is
not clear to the Working Group.
6.1.7 Hidden Cost of Social Media Alerting
Although alerts are issued via social media without charging the recipients, there are significant
costs attached to the use of this medium. Human resources are needed to monitor, “nurture”,
and grow subscriber-base of the alerting accounts during business-as-usual periods.
During emergency periods when incoming messages will normally spike, there is the greatest
demand on these human resources. The purchase of, maintenance of, and user-training for
systems aimed at aiding the emergency manager with using social media add to the cost – even
freeware requires maintenance and training.
6.1.8 Understanding Public Response
The public is unaccustomed to social media alerting relative to traditional alerting channels.
Even with the long established EAS, monthly tests help educate the public about what to expect
if an alert is actually sent out.
Given the ease of person-to-crowd communication over social media, a new phenomenon may
emerge whereby citizens take it upon themselves to issue emergency alerts to their communities
directly.
This phenomenon is perhaps facilitated by the perception (or reality) of emergency managers
being behind the curve on the use of social media. Some researchers are calling not only for the
acceptance of the phenomenon of “user-generated” alerts, but also for embracing it. Even
though there is value in sourcing information from citizens via social media, arguably,
delegating emergency notification to non-professional citizens can have negative consequences.
6.1.9 Geo-Targeting Social Media Alerting
Social Media Alerting has no inherent geo-targeting capability. At the same time, there is value
in sourcing information from citizens via social media. Even if we assume self-selective geo-
targeting by virtue of signing up with the local Emergency Manager, unaffected people may still
receive the alert, contributing to a cry-wolf effect, which in turn increases chances of tuning out
such alerts in the long run. At the same time, some people who are affected by the incident may
not receive the alert, putting them in danger.
IP-Location lookup is often cited as a method for geo-targeting; however it is not reliable
enough for emergency alerting. (Note: It will also require SMP intervention). The issue of geo-
targeting for social media alerts is almost equivalent to the issue of geo-targeting for Broadband
alerting. In the case of access without the use of GPS (i.e., web-browsers on traditional
Page 43 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
computers), the intervention of the SMP is necessary and that of the ISP may be needed. In the
case of GPS-available access (i.e., custom mobile apps on smartphones), the intervention of the
ISP is necessary.
6.1.10 Social Media Alerting and the Subscriber
Citizens must opt-in to receive social media alerts. A different approach would be to have ISPs
inject the alert into the network traffic carrying the social media data. However, such
“injection” may be deemed to be offensive or too aggressive, and it may lessen inherent trust in
the message.
One advantage of subscription is that once a citizen has subscribed, the person would not be
surprised if an alert message is received – immediately there is more trust in that information.
In the age of the Internet and social media, the public expects information to be delivered
instantaneously. It is sometimes argued that the public would value speed over accuracy,
whereby information comes out quickly and is updated later, rather than temporarily delaying its
transmission pending verification.
In the case of social media, the emergency manager is in competition with other sources that
may send out their version of the alert first, which could lessen the audience for the emergency
manager’s message.
The FCC should examine whether legacy procedures for issuing emergency alerts are optimal in
all cases in the age of social media, especially in terms of speed of issuance.
6.1.10.1 Crowd-to-Crowd Propagation
Crowd-to-crowd propagation of alerts is inevitable but uncontrollable. Inaccurate information
can bleed into the content as it is being forwarded. Erroneous information can cause public
reaction that aggravates the situation.
One goal is to design alert messages to spread as efficiently as possible, with as little mutation as
possible. Some individuals or organizations might intentionally provide inaccurate information
to confuse, disrupt, or otherwise thwart response efforts.
For example, a secondary attack after an initial attack can be planned to kill and injure first
responders, by using social media to notify officials of a false hazard or threat that requires a
response, especially in the immediate aftermath of the first attack.
6.1.10.2 Alerting Accounts
Other trusted sources can be allowed to put helpful information on the alerting account, e.g., fire
department. Establishing the trustworthiness of a source is necessary, and a cooperative
agreement between agencies is one way to establish trust prior to an emergency.
If there is no clear process for determining the trustworthiness of the third-party source, then
there is a risk of malicious abuse of trust by those placing misinformation for purpose of
Page 44 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
creating a panic.
Firsthand accounts from citizens can be posted on the alerting account. However, verifying the
accuracy of information from citizens can be difficult.
6.1.10.3 Limited by Available Data
Public response to SM alerting can be better understood and predicted via social sciences
research. A standard way of conducting social science research is by looking at population data
to determine societal macro-behavior. Data related to the public response to social media
alerting may be difficult to attain.
Some responses are not easy to measure via well-defined data. Some SMPs, who probably own
the data, may not feel comfortable disclosing whatever data they have and making it publicly
available.
At the same time, legitimate privacy concerns exist about the potential for the collection,
retention, and data mining of personal information by governments.
A message on Twitter or Facebook is not limited to the 90 characters of the CMAS protocol –
however, it is still important to know what to put in that message and in what order to convey
the information as effectively as possible to citizens
Prioritization of actionable life-saving information is important. This may be particularly true
for individuals with disabilities.
6.1.10.4 SM was not Built for Alerts
Unlike most of the other alert dissemination technologies, social media was not built to be
optimized for sending emergency alerts. Yet, as social media has become a dominant
communication force in today’s society, the prospect of maximizing or at least enhancing the
potential of social media for alerting is very appealing.
Social media has given rise to a variety of non-authoritative yet credible sources for alerts, such
as the Red Cross.
One advantage of this phenomenon is that citizens can get confirmation of alert information
from multiple sources, which adds creditability to the information and increases the sense of
urgency to respond to it.
A disadvantage of this phenomenon is that traditional government emergency managers now
must compete with multiple non-government sources, including loss of control over information
being sent out.
6.1.10.5 Elite Users
Elite users are social media account holders who in their own right have a large number of
subscribers. To the extent that such users become active in the post-alert conversation using
Page 45 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
social media, then they would be in position to influence public response.
The social media activity of elite users must be taken into consideration by the emergency
manager, as it has the potential both of being leveraged by the emergency manager to reinforce
the desired public response and of complicating the ability of the emergency manager to shape
the public response in a desired manner.
6.1.11 Media Congestion
Social media alerting may trigger a sudden flurry of Internet traffic. The surge in Internet traffic
may result in significant congestion of the Internet, particularly the wireless/cellular component
of it. In an extreme case, the surge in Internet traffic may bring down the network completely –
again especially in the case of wireless/cellular Internet. This outcome does not appear to have
been experienced to-date; however as more emergency managers use alerting accounts, and
alerting accounts attract more subscribers, this effect may eventually be experienced.
6.2 Social Media Alerting and the Access and Functional Needs Community
There are several groups of people with disabilities (PD) or other unavoidable functional
limitations. Prominent among them are the deaf and hard of hearing (DHH), visually impaired
and blind, cognitively disabled, motor skills limited and the aging.
Even within the same group, there can be several subgroups. In the case of the DHH group,
there are those who have complete loss of hearing since birth, those who lost hearing at some
point in their lives, and those who are partially deaf. There are similar subgroups within the
group of visually impaired and blind people.
There also are communities with multiple disabilities, such as the deaf-blind. Each PD group
may have certain needs that are unique to it.
6.2.1 Existing Technologies
In general, social media is consumed via computers and smartphones. Social media accessibility
challenges for the PD community form a subset of general computer/smartphone accessibility
(CSA) challenges. Providing alerts in multiple formats (i.e., text, graphics, video, and audio)
generally improves the accessibility of alerts to people with disabilities. Social media services
could leverage unique ring tones and vibration cadences for different types of hazard messages.
The greater challenge is not with the development of technological solutions, but the cost of
these solutions. For example, one off-the-shelf solution that converts a text message into voice
and voice into brail costs in excess of $5,000, making it inaccessible to nearly the entire
community that needs it.
6.2.2 Diverse Multimedia Content is Important
Multimedia content refers to having different types of content including text, audio, and video.
Multimedia content can be more diverse by having even more communication formats.
Page 46 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
In the case of text, there can be simple text (e.g., for cognitively disabled persons and for some
deaf people who have difficulty with reading) and complex text (for others who can benefit from
additional information).
In the case of video, it can contain text-based captioning (possibly with simple vs. advanced
language options in multiple languages) and signing.
Both sign language and captions are critical for the DHH community. Neither option by itself
meets the accessibility needs of every member of this diverse community.
6.2.3 Speed of Misinformation
Certain disabilities may impede the ability to process the content of a message.
Misunderstanding of information may be compounded when a person virally forwards the
information after adding misinformed commentary.
Expressing the information in multiple formats within the alert message limits the probability of
initial misunderstanding, and allows a second recipient to catch inconsistencies, and at least
think twice before forwarding the information further. This is a form of diversification that
combats the risk of confusion.
6.2.4 DHH Community More Reliant on Social Media for Emergency Information than
General Public
The DHH disability impedes the ability to communicate with others. According to leading
advocates for the DHH community, social media can be an effective means for overcoming such
impediments, and can provide an alternate way of obtaining emergency information. It is
therefore imperative to send alerts over social media for the benefit of members of the DHH
community. Use of simplified text in the alert message is preferred.
6.3 Enhancement of Social Media Alerting via other Internet/IT Tools
6.3.1 Video Uploads
First-hand account video (from citizens or in-the-field public safety officials) can be uploaded to
or referenced in alerting accounts. Video can be beneficial to (command-and-control) public
safety officials for whom situational awareness may be increased. Video material can be
beneficial to citizens in terms of gaining additional understanding about the emergency and acts
to reinforcing information about the hazard which may encourage the citizen to take lifesaving
action. YouTube has become the de facto repository for digital videos, and it is quite common
for social media messages to contain links to YouTube videos.
Emergency managers may be able to facilitate uploading videos or posting links on their
alerting accounts via social media apps. Emergency managers may also be able to facilitate
uploading videos or posting links on their alerting accounts by configuring them to be receptive
to commonly-used off-the-shelf tools for uploading videos and/or posting links.
6.3.2 Multiple Accounts
Page 47 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
Multiplicity of alerting accounts (on different social media platforms) is preferred. Collectively,
they reinforce each other and multiply the reach of the alert message. They also reinforce the
credibility of the alert message, as the citizen is in a position to receive it on multiple social
media channels.
In addition to sending emergency alerts over Facebook, Twitter, and perhaps increasingly
Google+, some emergency managers have taken to sending them on other social media sites
such as: YouTube, Meetup, USTREAM TV, Storify and blogtalkradio.
A significant challenge with having multiple social media accounts is that each requires logging
in and posting (in addition to other interfaces for other alerting technologies). There are existing
open-source tools that allow effectively managing multiple social media accounts from a single
dashboard interface that includes posting a message once to all accounts simultaneously.
Examples include HootSuite, TweetDeck, and Seesmic.
Additionally, alert origination tools (i.e., software applications) are increasingly tending towards
a one-interface approach that automatically originates the alert for multiple dissemination
channels (social media, SMS, Email, etc.). Tools that can help the emergency manager
automatically send out the alert on all their social media alerting accounts via a single activation
process would be very helpful.
6.3.3 Large Volume of Follow-up Messaging After a Social Media Alert
Emergency managers using social media for alerting want to have as many of their citizens as
possible become subscribers. One unique aspect about social media alerting is that issuing an
alert automatically sets up a two-way communication with citizens.
Citizens may use the two-way communication for calls-for-assistance or for requesting
lifesaving directives and information at the onset of an incident, or during an incident, that could
help under-prepared citizens. Citizens may use the two-way communication to provide first-
hand account of situational developments that can improve the emergency manager’s damage
assessment and situational awareness.
Issuing an alert over social media typically results in a large number of incoming messages from
citizens, and the more subscribers an emergency manager has, the more responsive messages
can be expected from those subscribers. Emergency managers may observe a responsibility to
respond to these messages.
IT tools (including natural language processing tools) can help emergency managers automate
responses to certain incoming messages and highlight those that require manual response.
6.3.4 Prioritizing Incoming Messages
Related to the large volume of incoming messages, it may be more efficient and beneficial not to
handle messages on a first-come-first-serve basis, but to prioritize those messages based on
urgency, relevance, etc. Again, IT tools (including natural language processing tools) can help
automatically prioritize incoming messages and present them to the emergency manager in a
Page 48 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
specified order of highest to lowest priority.
6.3.5 Post Incident Reporting
Post-Incident reports on the performance of the alert can help make technology and process
improvements for future uses of social media alerting.
Examples of performance metrics include: the number of citizens who received the alert over
social media; the number of citizens who requested 911-like assistance; the number of citizens
who posted response messages; the number of citizens who appropriately evacuated or sought
shelter as a result of social media alerting.
Performance measurements for this dissemination channel will create data that can be analyzed
post-incident to help understand how to better use this channel.
6.3.6 Other Tools
Geographic visualization tools can illustrate trends and common discussion points in incoming
messages on digital maps, based on location, which in turn can help emergency managers detect
patterns more easily than parsing through messages. SMP’s assistance in providing location
information (or estimates thereof) would be helpful for such geographic visualization tools.
Context analysis tools can detect buzzing topics early on, which can bring an important issue to
the emergency manager more quickly.
As previously noted, social media sites are not optimized for presenting emergency related
information. Therefore, it may be helpful to have a link to a dedicated landing webpage in the
body of a SM alert message. Dedicated webpages can be designed specifically to convey
emergency information and provide useful tools (e.g., translation buttons). This includes (links
to) maps, links to YouTube, etc. Having a landing webpage associated with each alert allows
(A) the presentation of the emergency related information using the most impactful web design
known, and (B) the provision of information to the public about the emergency incident in a
form that the public can trust to be free from commentary and annotation by other users as they
copy, paste, and forward messages.
The alerting account ideally should automatically post any applicable emergency alerts sent to
an AA (e.g., if the geo-targeting includes the alerting account’s jurisdiction). This would
require having an open channel between the alerting account and the Alert Aggregator.
If a social media alert goes out on a State emergency manager’s alerting account, it will not
automatically appear on a local emergency manager’s alerting account. It would be helpful if
alerting accounts immediately and automatically reposted alert messages from alerting accounts
corresponding to subsumed jurisdictions.
As more emergency managers use social media for alerting, and more citizens receive alerts via
social media, the potential for improving the efficacy and practicality of social media alerting
through supporting technological tools will also increase.
Page 49 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
Evidence of the value of supporting software tools anecdotally evident via the example of the
American Red Cross’ Digital Operations Center (Appendix E).
The next step would be to act on some or all of the individual areas highlighted above as a first
step towards developing a strategic vision for the enhancements of social media via supporting
software tools.
6.4 Involvement of SMPs in WG2
Despite substantial efforts at outreach and recruiting from the Working Group, social media
providers chose to play a very limited role in the Working Group’s activities. No social media
company authorized any of its employees to seek to become a member of WG2. A
representative of one social media provider participated in a number of WG2’s conference calls,
and representatives of two more social media providers made presentations by phone to a face-
to-face meeting of the Working Group. In these contacts, the providers noted their recognition
of the important roles that their organizations might play in alerting the public. They disclosed
that they have been approached by other entities regarding alerting issues. They spoke of the
existence of on-going internal initiatives and plans for new services aimed at supporting
emergency alerting over social media without revealing the details of those initiatives or
services.
WG2 interpreted the perceived lack of interest by SMPs in supporting social media alerting as
possibly being caused by one or more of the following concerns:
• Extra economic cost to SMPs without an obvious source of revenues for the service
rendered.
• Necessity of technical modifications to their systems – such technical modifications may
be different for different countries around the world, which is a concern for SMPs who
offer their services globally, as it creates technical complexity within networks.
• Concern over possible exposure of SMPs to legal liability.
• Necessity of coordination with FCC and/or FEMA, which in turn may be perceived as a
step towards further regulatory activity.
• Some forms of activities by SMPs through the delivery of emergency alerts over social
media may be deemed intrusive by their users.
SMPs can help with social media alerting in a variety of possible ways, including but not limited
to the following:
• Providing mechanism(s) for authenticating the alert message to the citizen (e.g., using
special symbols).
• Using their global view of message flows to detect messages containing inaccurate
information and/or malicious information.
• Managing opt-in/opt-out lists.
• Automatically making a social media user a subscriber to all alerting accounts covering
their geographic area (similar to but not the same as cooperation model).
• Assisting in geo-targeting, with the possibility of forcing the alert onto all users within an
affected area.
Page 50 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
• Prioritizing internal processing of traffic related to social media alerting – with
emergency alerts time is of the essence, so the faster the emergency alerts are delivered
the better.
6.4.1 Social Media Apps
In many if not all cases, direct intervention by the SMP can be substituted by an app on the
alerting account. Examples include an app that monitors the feed from an Alert Aggregator and
an app that manages opt-in/opt-out lists.
6.4.2 Large number of Alert Originators
There are thousands of authority personnel in the United States (federal, state, local, and tribal)
who legitimately qualify as Alert Originators. The large number of potential Alert Originators
in the U.S. poses at least two challenges to an SMP that wants to intervene in the delivery of
emergency alerts over social media:
• Challenge 1: The SMP potentially would need to coordinate with thousands of
emergency managers.
• Challenge 2: The SMP potentially would need to deal with multiple data formats for
communications with different Alert Originators.
Both challenges would be greatly mitigated (and arguably eliminated), if SMPs only needed to
interface with one AA using a single well-defined data format. The AA would absorb the
burden of forging business relationships as well as identity verification, authentication, and
authorization of AOs. By communicating with an AA, the SMP need only speak the data format
“language” of that AA – preferably that data format is CAP, which has become the de-facto
standard for emergency alert messages.
6.4.3 Mitigation of Challenges Through Virtual Volunteer Programs
Establishment of virtual volunteer programs may assist with the handling of social media
workload and "crowd sourcing" of information related to public alerting. Moreover, such
programs can improve situational awareness, identify falsely reported hazards, identify areas
where misinformation amongst the general public requires correction in future alert updates, and
ultimately save lives. Due to the level of service provided, such programs may also increase
trust and credibility by the public with the emergency management office and related
community decision leaders.
The American Red Cross has a virtual volunteer program for social media as part of its Digital
Operation Center. Also, NOAA has experience with volunteer reporting programs, such as
through its National Weather Service Storm Spotter program, which uses conventional
telephone and email technology for citizen reporting and validation of weather related hazards
and warnings.
Governmental organizations and emergency managers could study the models of the American
Page 51 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
Red Cross and NOAA in regard to training and certification of volunteers for virtual volunteer
programs related to social media and emergency alerting.
7 Working Group 2 Recommendations
7.1 Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)
For a federal architecture to achieve interoperability and information sharing, it is necessary to
have an autonomous system to ensure everyone “speaks the same language.” CAP does this.
Accordingly, WG2 recommends the following:
• The FCC should strive to protect CAP from fragmentation while allowing industry
groups to create their own profiles, possibly by ensuring the CAP Prime is constantly and
frequently updated to subsume any major emerging profiles.
• The FCC should continue to encourage the adoption of CAP data format for all alerting
technologies while facilitating its continued evolution to accommodate emerging needs
of various stakeholders in the field.
• The FCC should recommend that the CAP protocol in the future be extensible to support
specifications of new attributes/elements of various data types by the user community.
• The FCC should recommend that the CAP protocol in the future be able to communicate
“soft error” messages to indicate non-adherence to specific profiles despite adherence to
CAP.
• The FCC should continue to work with FEMA to encourage all State, Local, Tribal and
Territorial governments to pressure vendors to use CAP. Consideration should be made
for restricting federal funds for alerting technologies contingent on CAP compliance.
• Additional recommendations for best practices for implementing CAP-based alerts for
consumer electronics devices may be found in CEA-CEB25, Best Practices for
Implementing Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) based Alerts for Consumer Electronics
Devices.
7.2 Alerting Architecture
Assuming concurrence with the concept that a federated architecture plays an important role in
the introduction and widespread deployment of new alert dissemination technologies, the FCC
should work with Congress and/or FEMA to seek the allocation of federal funding to implement
and sustain emergency alerting federated architecture for the US public. One example would be
to fund the IPAWS-OPEN aggregator.
7.3 Alert Origination, Aggregation and Dissemination
WG2 recommends the following:
1. A great deal of confusion exists about the allowable powers of AOs. When origination is
limited to governmental agencies, control and training can be standardized. As the group
of AOs grows and extends past the bounds of emergency managers and NOAA, some
type of monitoring and authorizing of AOs will be necessary. Therefore, the FCC should
work with FEMA to develop a hierarchical process whereby each “parent” node can
empower “children” nodes and whereby the “parent” nodes are restricted to controlling
Page 52 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
or influencing only the area for which they are responsible.
2. The FCC should encourage ADs and AAs to implement the NIST recommended practice
of conducting CAP specification compliance and CAP profile conformance assessment
on any new equipment.
3. The FCC should discuss with ADs the conditions under which it would be acceptable for
ADs to “trim” alerts of high bandwidth consuming multimedia content for the sake of
keeping the AD network/infrastructure operational.
4. The FCC should study in more detail the use of single versus multiple alert aggregation
systems (refer to section 5.2.3 for details).
7.4 Device Manufacturers
WG2 recommends the following:
1. The FCC should encourage vendors of Alert Origination systems to leverage decision
support and artificial intelligence technologies to populate automatically certain fields on
the CAP message on behalf of the AO. This process would include the integration of
hazard predictors for natural and man-made incidents. An example would be the full
incorporation of downwind hazard prediction models to generate alert polygons and
originate alert messages. This should also include the generation of multimedia alerts
(e.g., if no audio file is explicitly included, then it generates one using text-to-speech
technology).
2. The FCC should encourage the use of open-source software components to facilitate the
implementation of alerting, including Mobile EAS alerts, for broadband devices. The
FCC should also consider offering incentives for device manufactures to implement the
alerting voluntarily.
3. Reinforcing the current vision of FEMA IPAWS, the FCC should encourage industry in
general and device manufacturers in particular to integrate multiple alert technologies on
devices to improve the reliability and opportunity to receive the alert message.
4. Recognizing that some entrepreneurially-driven next-generation alert dissemination
technologies will not be commercially viable without funding for R&D and/or financial
subsidies for deployment, the FCC should encourage Congress to provide funding to
support new alert dissemination technologies through FEMA grants.
5. The FCC should encourage the establishment of a program and accompanying logo
which certifies a public alerting application as providing alert information from official
trusted sources, such as FEMA IPAWS or NOAA feeds. The program could be
established by government, industry, or through a government-industry partnership.
6. The FCC should establish a consumer friendly rating (or levels), certification, and
accompanying logo which identify the specificity of geo-targeting provided by an alert

Final Report March 2013
application- particularly mobile devices. For example, the rating system could have 3
levels.
• Level 1 - The application alerts the user when the user is in the threat area. This
means the user can be alerted when the user's point location or user configurable
point location is within the alert polygon or circle when a polygon or circle is defined
in the CAP message.
• Level 2 - The application alerts the user when the user is approximately in the threat
area. This means the user can be alerted when the user's location is specified at the
sub-county level (e.g., zip code, city, etc.) and overlaps the alert polygon or circle
when a polygon or circle is defined in the CAP message.
• Level 3 - The application alerts the user when user may be in the threat area. This
means the user can be alerted when the user's location is specified at the county level
or better and overlaps the alert geo-code (i.e., county) defined in the CAP message.
7.5 Technology
WG2 recommends the following:
1. The FCC should recognize that market forces alone may not bring about new alert
dissemination technologies that benefit the nation. One prior example of this is CMAS;
another is the prospect of broadband alerts, which is mentioned in FCC’s Broadband
Plan as a desired alert dissemination method in the future.
The FCC should take an active role in developing a strategic plan for identifying and
deploying such technologies. This could include:
• Creating consortiums or standards bodies to enable key stakeholders to work
together for the purposes of helping to formulate and ultimately to implement the
strategic plan.
• Putting reasonable policies in place, aimed at removing regulator/legal barriers to
the deployment of such technologies.
2. The FCC should encourage developers of alert origination systems to focus on how to
better carry metadata such as targeted geographic area and authoritative URL for a
landing webpage as it traverses the alert activity chain.
7.6 Access and Functional Needs
WG2 recommends the following:
1. As the FCC continues to evaluate the benefit of an action aimed at enhancing the
efficacy of social media alerting for persons with disabilities, the FCC should perform
the evaluation separately for each group and subgroup within the overall access and
Page 54 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
functional needs community.
2. The FCC should conduct surveys of existing CSA technologies to identify those best
suited for social media consumption and continue to promote research and development
for technologies for automatically converting text emergency alert messages into
multimedia messages, including sign language translation. Research should also be
conducted to develop technologies for reformatting complex emergency alert messages
into simple text.
3. The FCC and FEMA should offer grants to alerting system developers who will render
CAP content in new ways that increase accessibility for people with disabilities.
7.7 Social Media
WG2 recommends the following:
1. The FCC should encourage the development of standardized training programs for
emergency managers on Social Media Alerting. This program should be current,
comprehensive, relevant, and reflect best practices for different types of communities
and jurisdictions.
2. The FCC should produce a strategic vision for IT/Internet tools that support SM alerting
and make it available to the public through an authoritative source. The vision should be
communicated to AOs and be part of the Social Media alerting training program.
3. The FCC should discuss the feasibility, practicality and policy related challenges related
to ISP assisted Geo-targeting of Social Media alerts with ISPs and SMPs. They should
engage SMPs regarding enhancing their mobile apps to geo-target emergency alerts
transmitted over social media. They should also open discussions on the possibility,
challenges, and costs of opting in all users to federal alerting account.
4. The FCC should encourage the development of and help acquire government funding for
developing innovative technologies for handling crowd-sourced inaccurate information.
5. The FCC should encourage government and emergency management organizations to
consider adoption of virtual volunteer programs to ensure the operability, reliability, and
resilience of social media for public alerting.
7.8 Future Alert Dissemination Technologies
WG2 recommends the following:
1. The FCC should coordinate with the industry to provide recommendations for the next
version of CMAS, taking into consideration the recent advances in mobile devices (i.e.,
the advent of smartphones), as well as cellular networks (i.e., the ongoing migration to
4G networks) and Mobile EAS (CAP alerts delivered to mobile devices over Mobile
DTV broadcasting).
Page 55 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
2. The FCC should clearly define the goals, objectives, and targets for Broadband Alerting
technology and erect a voluntary consortium body, similar to the CMAS body that
consists of ISPs, with the understanding that ISPs play a similar role to TV and Radio
stations. This consortium body would be charged to develop a unified plan and set of
standards and practices for deploying Broadband Alerting to ensure that citizens across
the U.S. are capable of receiving Broadband Alerts at the same service level. The FCC
also should work to develop rules and regulations that address ISP concerns about legal
liabilities and public perception related to delivering Broadband Alerts.
3. The FCC should continue to encourage the development of new technologies for
alerting, while stressing the importance of sustaining existing alert and warning
platforms as well. Our population continues to rely on a wide variety of technologies to
communicate, and most people seem wed to one system or another. Eliminating one
platform for another risks losing contact with a portion of our citizens. The best way to
mitigate this is to preserve current technologies while developing new platforms for the
future.
4. The FCC should also study and report on lessons learned from recent disasters, including
the 2011 Great Earthquake and Tsunamis in Japan, severe tornados and wildfires in the
U.S., as well as Superstorm Sandy.
5. The FCC should prioritize communication and coordination with other government
agencies which are examining similar issues and holding workshops and seminars and/or
issuing reports regarding developments in alerting theory, protocols, and technology,
including without limitation the Department of Homeland Security Science and
Technology Directorate, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Congressional
Research Service.

Appendix C - Different Options for Alert Aggregation
Figure 11 shows a generic federated architecture, while purposefully emphasizing the fact that
there are different options for the alert aggregation box. It is also important to note that the
architecture does not preclude direct connectivity between AOs and ADs.
For example, as depicted in Figure 12, alert aggregation can be performed by a single AA,
which in the future may or may not be IPAWS-OPEN.
Figure 13 shows a possible architecture with multiple AA’s. In this scenario, private sector
AA’s would be competing for the business of AOs and ADs.
Figure 14 shows that in the case of multiple aggregators they may be organized hierarchically.
This for example may be a natural way of organization that mirrors the hierarchy of local-state-
federal jurisdictional hierarchy. It may be also be possible to have aggregators dedicated to
certain types of Alert Originators or certain types of locales (e.g., college campuses). If multiple
AAs are indeed available to AOs and ADs, then having a definitive and comprehensive directory
for the AAs would be helpful.

Figure 14 – Alert Aggregation Performed by Multiple Aggregators, Some in Parallel and Some Organized Hierarchically
The Value of Alert Aggregation
In theory, the Alert Aggregator is not necessary in the federated architecture. Given the
ubiquitous presence of the Internet, AOs and ADs can communicate directly over the Internet or
satellite. In addition to the Alert Aggregators not being operationally necessary, there are at
least four arguments against having Alert Aggregators.
First, since one the primary metrics of public alerts is the length of time it takes for the public to
receive the alert, one argument against alert aggregation is that it introduces time delay.
However, this counter argument may be more perceived than actual. No one is claiming that
either EAS or CMAS (which today go through the IPAWS-OPEN aggregator) is failing on that
point. Furthermore, the speed of digital communication is constantly improving, so even if delay
issues did exist, they will disappear in the future. Finally, the time scale of any delay (even if
current time delays persist) is minuscule (at most a few seconds), that it is highly unlikely to
make a life-and-death difference (will sending an alert directly to Facebook save a few seconds,
and if so will it make a life and death difference?)
Second, for some simple AD channels going through an AA can appear to be a roundabout way
of transmitting an alert. For example, it can be argued that the ETN dissemination channel is not
designed to deliver media-rich versions of the alert (e.g., video-based alerts) that would benefit
Page 63 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
from the big TCP/IP data pipes and the CAP-format alert messaged likely to be associated with
the AA. So ETN really does not need to go through an AA.
Third, the federal government cannot realistically mandate and enforce that all public alerts go
through (an) Alert Aggregator(s). For example, there is nothing to stop schools or universities
from using a third-party stovepipe alerting system.
Regarding the second and third arguments above, it is not expected that the AA-based federated
architecture will be the only architecture for emergency alerting. It is possible for it to exist
alongside several stovepipe architectures and possibly non AA-based federated architectures.
Fourth, if Alert Aggregators are standards-based, whereby standards may be influenced by the
constraints of large infrastructures such as Cable, Radio, and Telecom, then changes to such
standards would not be swiftly concocted or executed.
That said however, the AA component in the federated offers several practical advantages – so
much so that ironically the alert aggregator in the federated architecture (for emergency alerts) is
possibly the most critical component of the architecture. The AA performs several functions:
1. Shared facility for a priori identity verification and authorization: An alert message has
such an impact on a community that it better have emanated from an emergency manager.
The AA can perform a priori verification of the identity of the AO, and can verify that the
AO is authorized to send out alerts (potentially with different authorization levels for
different types of alert messages).
2. Shared facility for authentication: The AA can have in place mechanisms for verifying the
authenticity of an alert message i.e., that it did indeed come from the AO that it claims it
came from.
3. Reduction of number of business relationships: If AOs and ADs were to exchange
messages directly in a point-to-point fashion; each AO-AD pair would have to forge a
separate business relationship. Instead, the AOs can establish business relationships with the
AA on one end, and the ADs can establish business relationships with AA on the other end.
The total number of business relationships in this scenario would be significantly smaller in
the latter scenario.
4. Legal liability indemnification: ADs may be wary of any legal liabilities connected with
the dissemination of alerts to the public. The AA can indemnify ADs of such legal liabilities,
as long as the ADs observe their agreements with the AA.
5. Routing: At a first glance, it may seem that the critical role that it plays is that of router –
this would imply that the AO system would not know how to deliver the alert message to the
AD, and therefore relies on the AA to route the alert message to the AD. However, this may
be a misleading view. First, in the age of the Internet, it suffices for the AO to have the
URL/IP address of the AD (or its gateway), and have the Internet perform the routing of the
message to the AD. Knowledge of the AD’s URL/IP address would certainly be the case, if
the two entities have a business relationship. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that an AO
would be interested in disseminating the alert message over TV airwaves for example,
without knowing precisely which broadcast station(s) cover(s) their jurisdiction. In that case,
the AA may play a routing role in the sense of resolving which broadcasting station(s)
geographically correspond to the targeted alerting area.
Page 64 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
By performing the functions above, the presence of the AA greatly reduces the barriers-to-entry
for innovative value-adding AO systems and AD methods/technologies.
One key advantage of the federated architecture that would be enjoyed by emergency managers
is the realistic possibility of having a single AO interface that activates all the AD systems
simultaneously. This advantage is important in the immediate aftermath of an incident when
every second counts. With stovepipe systems, the emergency managers lose time activating
different systems from separate interfaces.
Conditions for a Successful Federated Architecture Centered on Alert Aggregation
For a federated architecture to indeed achieve interoperability and information sharing, it is
would be greatly helpful if the autonomous systems within it “spoke the same language”. In the
case of emergency notification, speaking the same language requires:
1) Speaking the same networking language, and
2) Speaking the same language for the alert message
The path of least resistance for (1) is the Internet Protocol suite (e.g., TCP/IP). The path of least
resistance for (2) is the CAP protocol.
The Internet Protocol suite is well-established with no danger of fragmentation.
The CAP protocol however does face the danger of fragmentation, as different industry groups
may adapt it to their specific needs.

Appendix D - EAS Illustrations – Differences between Classic Version and
CAP/IPAWS
The illustrations below provide an overview of the classic EAS network and an introduction to
the CAP/IPAWS network. In reviewing these drawings it can easily be seen that the
CAP/IPAWS network complexity has increased, but will start allowing the capability to adapt
the distribution and content of the alert communications because of geographic location, risks, or
personal user preferences, as appropriate. This can be extended to those with disabilities and
those without an understanding of the English language.
Figure 15 – Classic EAS Network
At present, the United States is divided into approximately 550 EAS local areas, each of which
contains at least two Local Primary stations, designated “Local Primary One” (LP1), “Local
Primary Two” (LP2), and so on. The LP stations must monitor at least two EAS sources for
Presidential messages (including State Primary stations and in some cases a regional PEP
station), and also can serve as the point of contact for state and local authorities and NWS to
activate the EAS for localized events such as severe weather alerts. All other EAS Participants
are designated Participating National (PN) stations and must monitor at least two EAS sources,
including an LP1 and an LP2 station as specified in the state’s EAS plan.
Summary
The details, assumptions and conclusions presented in this paper are based on the current
understanding of the deployed CAP/IPAWS system. As with any assumption, these are subject
to change as the CAP/IPAWS system evolves.
This notwithstanding it has become apparent that the growth and evolution of the CAP/IPAWS
system will be primarily controlled as the need arises. At this time the most effective way to
control this type of expected changes is by establishing a Joint Users Taskforce that is charged
with the management of the policy and procedure that surround the operation of the
CAP/IPAWS system.

Through-out this document there have been recommendations made for hardware enhancements
and the creation of supporting documents (best practices) establishing supporting policies. In
the order of importance the documentation and polices are needed to support the currently
deployed base of EAS alert providers. It is critical that the users of this network are trained and
qualified to do so. It is also critical that the EAS and CMAS alert providers understand what
their requirements are under the law, so that compliance is assured.

Appendix E - Relevant Example of SM in Emergency Management
In 2009, the American Red Cross commissioned a study which found that social media sites are
the fourth most popular source to access emergency information. Social media are also
commonly used by individuals and communities to warn others of unsafe areas or situations,
inform friends and family that someone is safe, and raise funds for disaster relief.
Based in part on that study, the American Red Cross intensified is efforts in using social media
in its emergency management-related operations. This section discusses the efforts the ARC
with respect to using social media in emergency management.
Figure 16 - High-level Activity Chain for Emergency Response, Planning and Management
Looking at Figure 16, although the ARC operates mostly in the “Damage Recovery and
Restoration” phase, as opposed to the “Public Notification” phase, the use of social media has
comparable facets with its use for alerts and warnings. Moreover, ARC seemingly has set the
standard for the use of social media in emergency management, in terms leveraging advanced
technologies as well as human volunteers; and also in terms of best practices for emergency-
related human dialogue over social media. Indeed, the example of the ARC provides valuable
lessons for the use of social media to deliver alerts and warnings.
Focusing on the advanced technology that ARC is currently using, the ARC has set up, within
its headquarters’ disaster operations center (DOC), a “Digital Operations Center” (DigiDOC).
DigiDOC is an area that is twenty feet long by eight feet wide, with three computers and six flat-
panel displays on a wall, that provide visualization tools. DigiDOC It is staffed with three full-
time employees, but leverages an army of off-premises volunteers. DigiDOC serves four
purposes:
It provides a single snapshot to DOC workers of what is happening on the social web
o
during a given disaster using advanced visualization tools.
The technology powering these visualizations gives us a bigger picture of situational
o
awareness.
It helps the ARC to begin anticipating the needs of an affected community, whether
o
clients, donors, or others.
It gives the ARC the ability to decentralize, whereby it allows the ARC to increase the
o
number of people engaging citizens from the three full-time staff members to include
subject matter experts (SMEs) in the DOC as well as digital volunteers, during high-
demand periods. Both groups can be trained offline on how to engage the public. (The
DOC SMEs can also help with building the digital volunteers base).
The figures below show the visualization tools which the ARC finds extremely valuable for its
Page 68 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
social media operations.
Figure 17 shows the heat map, which shows volume of conversations about a given topic based
on geography.
The Community screen in Figure 18 also shows tweets about a chosen topic profile – it helps
one understand who is talking about a particular subject. The screen displays a random selection
of tweets from the last 4 hours and displays them. The bigger the profile image on the screen,
the more influence the person has. Influence is measured by the size of the person’s following
and also how often they have talked about this subject.
The Universe screen in Figure 19 displays several Topic Profiles in a sun-and-planet format. It
shows results from the last 3 days. The “Sun” is the primary subject of each Topic Profile. The
“Planets” are different groups of keywords within that broader subject that we’ve broken it
down into. This visualization helps the ARC quickly see how many posts each subject group is
pulling in and what the overall sentiment is.
The screen in Figure 20 displays a bigger picture dashboard where the ARC can see overall
volumes of conversation over a number of days, our share of voice versus partners, and overall
sentiment.

It is important to note that the visualization tools are provided by a commercial provider, namely
Radian6. The funding of DigiDOC, including the purchase of the Radian6 software, was
provided by Dell. So as valuable as they are, the ARC would not have been able to afford the
visualization tools by itself. In addition, the visualization tools required significant training (over
a period of several months) for the staff using it. The ARC staff also invested significant amount
of time providing feedback and working with to Radian6, for the latter to tweak it internal
parameters of the visualization tools to reflect the priorities of the ARC.

Appendix F – About Broadband Alerting
Broadband Alerting warrants special attention because it was specifically mentioned in FCC’s
2010 National Broadband Plan. The plan stated:
1- “Broadband can also provide the public with new ways of calling for help and receiving
emergency information” and
2- “A cutting-edge public safety communications system uses broadband technologies … to
revolutionize the way Americans are notified about emergencies and disasters so they
receive information vital to their safety.”
In addition, the term Broadband Alerts is increasingly being thrown around in the emergency
alerting community.
Definition of Broadband Alerts
One of the main challenges to understanding Broadband Alerting technologies is the definition
of Broadband Alerts. The central question is:
If the alert is transported via Broadband, does
that make it a Broadband Alert?
If the answer to that question is yes, then a whole class of technologies can be classified as
Broadband Alerting technologies, making some technologies in use today classifiable as
Broadband Alerts, which in turn arguably makes Broadband Alerting a reality today.
Comparison of Broadband Alerting Technologies
Table 7 below compares the different technologies that can possibly be classified as Broadband
Alerting technologies under the most liberal definition. Before starting the comparison, the
parameters of comparison are first established.
The comparison parameters are described in Table 6:
Parameter Values Explanation
Geo-targeting No deliberate/explicit geo-targeting of alert
Increasing degrees of precise definition
of alert area and adherence to defined
area when delivering alert
Polygonal specification of alert area with
100% adherence in delivery
Subscription-Based Yes Citizen must subscribe to receive alerts
No Citizens receive alerts without having
subscribed, unless explicitly opting out
Service/Device Customization Yes The service/device must be customized in a
particular way to receive alerts e.g., software
installation e.g., desktop alerts
No Out-of-the-box setup/configuration
Page 72 of 81The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council III Working Group 2
Final Report March 2013
sufficient to receive the alert e.g., CMAS,
EAS, Emergency Telephone Notification
Specific Service/Device Usage Yes The service/device must be used in a
particular way to receive the alert e.g., a TV
viewer must be tuned to a particular TV
channel
No As long as the service/device is being used,
the alert will be received

Broadband Alerting and Geo-targeting
Geo-targeting for Broadband alerts has turned out to be a different challenge for Wireless
Broadband vs. Landline Broadband – not so much because of any inherent difference between
the two technologies, but rather because wireless Broadband end-devices are increasingly GPS-
capable which can be leveraged for geo-targeting (with certain limitations such as z-axis). In the
case of landline Broadband, the ISP’s intervention is necessary to deliver alerts in a geo-targeted
fashion.
