Page iii TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 PrivateExecutive Summary
The San Francisco Bay Area was selected by CSRIC-III Working Group 3 (WG3) to serve as the setting
for the Stage-1 Indoor Test Bed. The testing followed the methodology adopted in the CSRIC Test Plan,
which was based upon the indoor test methodology defined, and adopted by consensus, in ATIS-0500013.
This methodology centers on performing the indoor testing in sample buildings within the salient
representative morphologies (i.e., wireless use environments), which are dense urban, urban, suburban
and rural.
Polygons surrounding areas that contain the four morphologies were defined by WG3. They spanned the
Bay area from the City of San Francisco and extending to 40 miles south of San Jose. 19 buildings were
selected within those boundaries through intensive cooperation among WG3’s building subcommittee,
public safety, local officials, private contacts and the “test house” performing the indoor testing,
TechnoCom. The eventual distribution of buildings tested was 6 dense urban, 5 urban, 6 suburban and 2
Rural. The selected buildings formed a diverse sample of building types commonly present in the four
basic environments and a solid, challenging test sample that represented well beyond California.
75 test points were selected by TechnoCom in the 19 buildings per the criteria of the CSRIC test plan.
Until the delivery of the test results in second half of January, the locations of the test points were not
shared with any member of WG3, including any company participating in or funding the test bed.
Statistically significant samples of stationary test calls were placed from each test point using multiple
test devices for each of the 3 location technologies under test by NextNav, Polaris Wireless, and
Qualcomm. In all, over 13,000 valid test calls were collected across the test points for each of the 3
technologies. Polaris’ results were aggregated over AT&T’s and T-Mobile’s networks. Qualcomm’s
results were aggregated over Sprint’s and Verizon’s networks. NextNav operated essentially as a stand-
alone overlay location network. Broad and representative wireless industry participation was thus
achieved in Stage-1 of the test bed.
To ensure that indoor ground truth accuracy did not introduce measurable errors in the results,
TechnoCom used a certified land surveyor from the Bay Area, using well established land survey
techniques. This ensured that the highest quality and reliability was achieved in comparing the test call
locations to the actual ground truth. The surveyed information included latitude, longitude and altitude at
each test point. The certified accuracy was +/-1cm horizontal a +/-2cm vertical, which is far better than
the minimum required accuracy.
The test results are provided for the various location performance attributes under test, namely, horizontal
location accuracy, vertical accuracy, yield, time to first fix (TTFF), and reported uncertainty.
Furthermore, to provide CSRIC WG3 and the FCC with insight into the qualitative indoor performance of
the location technologies in the different environments, and to place the location error distances in the
proper indoor perspective, scatter diagrams have been prepared and provided for each technology at each
test point.
The quantitative results have also been aggregated by building and by morphology. Summary results
across the four morphologies are presented first, followed by the detailed results for the test points in each
test building, grouped by morphology.
Concise observations on the results, which benefit from the insight gained by TechnoCom in selecting the
test points and becoming intimately familiar with their surroundings, are also provided to aid the reader in
interpreting the results. The report is then concluded with a summary of the lessons learned and
suggestions for future test beds, presented from the perspective of the independent test house executing
the indoor testing within the constraints of the real world.
Page 1 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Private1 Introduction
1.1 Test Bed Background and Objectives
CSRIC III Working Group 3 (WG3) was tasked by the FCC to investigate wireless location in the context
of indoor wireless E911. In June 2012, WG3 submitted its initial report to the FCC regarding Indoor
Location Accuracy for E9-1-1. As one of its primary findings, the report identified the lack of objective
and validated information regarding the performance of available location technologies in various
representative indoor environments. The Working Group identified obtaining this critical information as
its highest priority and established a set of cooperative actions, including the creation of an independent
test bed, to accomplish this task.
WG3 created the framework for the test bed whose objectives have been to:
- Objectively and independently test the accuracy and dependability of location technologies in a
wide range of representative indoor environments reflective of wireless use.
- Provide the FCC with verified data on the capabilities of location technologies on which to base
their decisions regarding the strategic direction of E911, which is increasingly affected by indoor
wireless use.
- Establish a benchmark upon which emerging technologies can be compared to determine their
relative promise in improving the capabilities that are currently available (both in terms of
accuracy and/or consistency).
1.2 Independent Test House
One of the key attributes of the test bed, as well as key to its success, is employing a well-qualified,
experienced, independent contractor to perform the tasks of test planning, test execution, data analysis
and reporting to WG3.
Since its inception in 1995, TechnoCom has been providing its engineering expertise to a host of location
technology companies and wireless carriers evaluating and subsequently deploying some of those
technologies. Throughout its history, TechnoCom has opted to take a location technology vendor
independent approach to its E911 quality of service assurance and testing business.
Over the last decade, TechnoCom has also been a key player in the development and adoption of industry
standard E911 testing methodologies. Notably, TechnoCom was a lead contributor in the development of
the indoor testing methodology within ATIS’s ESIF, which is the methodology adopted by CSRIC WG3
as the basis for indoor testing within the test bed.
Upon a formal RFI process, TechnoCom was awarded the independent test house role. It has brought a
strong commitment from its principals to the successful execution of this test bed effort.
1.3 Scope of Report
This report contains the results of the indoor testing performed by TechnoCom in November and
December of 2012 on behalf of WG3. To cast the results in the proper context, introductory sections
concisely describe the testing approach, testing criteria, and the three specific technologies tested in this
stage of the test bed. A more detailed description of the representative environments (morphologies) is
then presented along with the specific buildings selected within each of the morphologies for inclusion in
Page 2 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privatethe test bed. The information included on the selected buildings is important in providing the reader with
insight for interpreting the results of the testing. The results are then provided first in summary form and
then in more detail for each of 75 test points. The summary results are aggregated by building and by
morphology. Concise observations on the results, which benefit from the insight gained in selecting the
test points and becoming intimately familiar with their surroundings, are also provided to aid the reader in
interpreting the results. The report is then concluded with a summary of the lessons learned from playing
the role of the independent test house and executing the indoor testing in the real world.
Per the direction of WG3, the precisely surveyed ground truth coordinates have been withheld and
provided to the funding participants of the Stage-1 testing. Nineteen formal survey reports (one for each
of 19 test buildings) containing the detailed coordinates and descriptions of the each of the test points
along with additional pictures for site visits have also been provided to the funding participants of the test
bed.

2 Test Approach
2.1 Side by Side Testing
In the dynamic, aggressively competitive wireless industry, a longstanding complaint voiced by wireless
carriers centers on the unsubstantiated claims of some location technology vendors about the performance
and reliability of their technologies. This is particularly true of new or emerging technologies that have
not been subjected to extensive validation in the field. The tests conducted and the results presented in
this report seek to provide a common base to test all technologies available.
Since the initial discussion within WG3, the concept of objective side-by-side testing of location
technologies under well defined, clearly quantifiable conditions became a central tenet of the test bed
concept. Fortunately, the test methodology developed in ATIS-0500013 for indoor testing readily lent
itself to such rigorous side-by-side testing.
2.2 Representative Morphologies (Use Environments)
The many challenges of indoor testing compared to the mostly vehicle based outdoor testing are well
publicized. Indoor testing cannot be practically performed (at least today) in hundreds or thousands of
buildings in a given test area. From that reality arose the notion of testing indoor performance in
representative scenarios. Figure 2.2-1 illustrates the logical flow-down in this methodology.
In each morphology (i.e., broad wireless use environment) a number of buildings of different sizes and
types common in that morphology are identified. Within each building, different test points are selected
to represent the range of conditions encountered within that building. The number of test points in a
given building depends on its size and complexity. Then at each test point a statistically significant
number of independent test calls is placed from one or multiple handsets. The morphologies (or wireless
use environments) are those that were defined in ATIS-0500011, namely, dense urban, urban, suburban
Page 3 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privateand rural. These morphologies have subsequently been adopted in ATIS-0500013 defining the
recommended indoor location test methodology.
Figure 2.2-1. Morphology, Building and Test Point Flow Down
The San Francisco Bay area was chosen by WG3 because it has the various distinct morphologies sought.
It enables efficient testing that could be achieved with one test team, with a reasonable amount of travel
within the area. A dense urban polygon was identified in the City of San Francisco around its financial
district. Two urban polygons were selected one in San Francisco adjacent to the dense urban polygon and
one in Downtown San Jose. Those two urban settings are somewhat different with San Francisco
representing an older urban clutter and San Jose a newer clutter with wider streets and more spaced large
buildings. A large suburban polygon was selected in Silicon Valley centered around Santa Clara-
Sunnyvale-San Jose. The rural polygon was chosen 40 miles south of Downtown San Jose between
Gilroy and Hollister, primarily driven by the desire to have a relatively sparse cellular site density as seen
in rural areas that are more remote or outside California. The polygons representing the 4 morphologies
are described in detail, including the buildings chosen in each in Section 5.
Between the 19 buildings spanning the 4 distinct morphologies a wide spectrum of building types and
settings were attained. This was complemented by a wide range of test point scenarios inside those
buildings. This created a broadly representative sample with very meaningful results, demonstrative of
indoor performance in many areas throughout the United States.
2.3 Statistically Significant Samples
Indoor location performance can suffer from rapid changes in signal conditions and can experience
significant performance variation from call to call even within a short period of time. It is therefore
necessary to use a large enough sample of independent calls at each test point to arrive at reliable
(statistically significant) performance statistics. The consensus of the WG3 Test Plan sub-group has been
that a minimum recommended sample size per technology per test point is 100 calls.
Test planning proceeded based on that requirement to arrive at the best combination of number of devices
to test simultaneously per technology, the minimum required length of the test calls, and how long it takes
to place the required calls vis-à-vis the need to complete testing in each building in no more than a day.
This delicate balance, after some adjustments during the early days of actual testing, resulted in that this
target was easily met at the vast majority of test points. Over 13,400 test calls were placed from the
devices of each of the 3 technologies at 74 valid test points, averaging over 180 calls per test point. On
few sporadic occasions, which coincided with the most RF challenging indoor situations, smaller samples
were collected from some devices because the units or their applications encountered some difficulties in
placing the test calls. Still adequate statistical samples were collected essentially everywhere. Aiding in
this regard was the aggregation of the data gathered over two wireless networks to create a joint sample
Page 4 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privatefor a technology. (Verizon and Sprint data was aggregated to produce the Qualcomm results whereas
AT&T and T-Mobile data was aggregated to produce the Polaris results.)
2.4 Accurate, Reliable Indoor Ground Truths
The general requirements for indoor ground truth accuracy have been quoted in ATIS-0500013. For
general test purposes a 5 m accuracy is likely acceptable, and that is was the minimum required accuracy
in TechnoCom’s Statement of Work.. However, since this test bed is a particularly visible benchmark and
a model for the future, TechnoCom deemed it important to follow the most exacting of ground truth
determination methods described in 0500013, namely using a professional survey company. TechnoCom
selected a certified land surveying vendor from the Bay Area, who is intimately familiar with the
morphology and terrain. This has ensured that the highest quality and reliability is achieved in comparing
the test call locations to the actual ground truth of the selected test points. The survey information
provided by the vendor included latitude, longitude and height. The certified accuracy is +/-1cm
horizontal a +/-2cm vertical, which is far better accuracy than the minimum required 5 m accuracy. The
survey method and equipment are described in Section 4.2, along with a sample survey ground truth
output measurement.
2.5 Performance Attributes Analyzed
2.5.1 Location Accuracy
The error in estimating the location of the device under test was computed by comparing each vendor’s
reported horizontal position (provided to TechnoCom) to the surveyed ground truth position of the test
location (determined through a precise survey). Each test call (or equivalent) was assumed to be
independent from prior calls and accuracy was based on the first location delivered by the vendor after
“call initiation.”
This accuracy information is presented in Section 6 for each technology at each test point and aggregated
by morphology. The accuracy statistics include the 67th, 90th and 95th percentiles of horizontal accuracy
along with the average distance error, standard deviation of error, and minimum and maximum errors, all
in meters. Aggregate statistics are also provided by building and by morphology. In addition, the error
CDF has also been provided for each technology per point and aggregated by morphology. Comparative
results for the 3 technologies under test have also been provided in the form of overlaid CDFs and bar
graphs for the 4 morphologies (dense urban, urban, suburban and rural).
Vertical distance error has also been reported separately for the NextNav technology. The absolute
vertical distance error has been used in these statistical computations. CDFs are also provided for the
vertical error by morphology.
For AGPS, valuable information that has a close relationship to accuracy is fix type (e.g., GPS, AFLT,
Hybrid, etc.). The obtained accuracy is directly related to the fix type, particularly the proportion of GPS
fixes attainable. Since fix type information is available from the extracted PDE logs, it is included in the
detailed per test point results for AGPS.
2.5.2 Latency (TTFF)
The Time to First Fix (TTFF) or the time to obtain the first computed caller location is reported for each
technology at each test point and aggregated by building and by morphology. This processing time is
calculated by establishing the precise time for call initiation (or an equivalent initiation event if the
vendor’s test configuration did not support the placement of an emergency like call, e.g., 922). TTFF
statistics are reported in Section 6 on a per test point per technology and aggregated per building and by
morphology.
Page 5 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Private2.5.3 Yield
The yield of each technology is evaluated by relying on the information received from each vendor’s log
files and/or that which is generated inside the device that is accessible to TechnoCom. For each test
point, the calls that result in no location fix will be deemed as calls with no delivered location. Yield will
be the % of calls with delivered location to overall “call attempts” at each test point. Even though 30
seconds is considered the de facto standard maximum latency, if a location fix is delivered after 30
seconds it is still included in successful call attempts.
The yield results are reported in Section 6 on a per test point per technology and aggregated per building
and by morphology.
2.5.4 Reported Uncertainty
The horizontal uncertainty reported by the location systems has been captured and as needed normalized
to correspond to 90% confidence. The reported uncertainty at each test point is compared to the fraction
of calls for which the resulting (empirically measured) location falls inside the uncertainty circle. The
ideal number would be 90% of the calls have an actual error that causes the reported locations to fall
inside the reported uncertainty circle. In some instances technology vendors opt for a more conservative
measure with a target of more than 90% falling inside the circle. Importantly, the quality of the
uncertainty measure generally reflects how well a location system is operating, with poor performance
very often associated with a low proportion of computed locations falling inside the reported uncertainty
circle. The uncertainty results are also aggregated by building and by morphology for each technology.
2.5.5 Location Scatter
To provide CSRIC WG3 and the FCC with insight into the qualitative indoor performance of the various
location technologies in the different environments, to aid in discerning possible effects of specific
structural features at certain test points, and to place any common reference error distances in the proper
indoor perspective, scatter diagrams have been prepared and provided for each technology at each test
point. Overlaying the location scatter results on the building landscape, e.g., from Google Earth imagery,
yields considerable insight into the potential and limitations of the attained indoor performance in each
setting. Building sizes and densities vary significantly with the change in morphology and overlaying the
obtained locations on an actual map of the buildings in the target area yields a rich insight into attainable
versus aspired for or ideal accuracy performance for the E911 application.
3 Location Technologies Tested in Stage-1
3.1 Technology from NextNav
The NextNav location system utilizes GPS-like signals transmitted by the NextNav terrestrial beacon
transmitters deployed across a geographical area. The signals transmitted from the beacons are
spread‐spectrum signals using Gold codes at a 1.023 Mcps chipping rate, similar to GPS. The beacons
transmit in the 900 MHz licensed band. The NextNav network uses two identical signals, one with a
center frequency at 926.227 MHz and one with a center frequency at 920.773 MHz. Using two channels
is intended to provide frequency diversity, aiming to enhance the robustness of the service. The beacon
broadcast transmissions carry all the necessary information for positioning at the NextNav receiver
(handset based positioning).
Page 6 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Private3.1.1 Devices Tested
The devices utilized in this stage of the test bed were standalone receivers (sleeves) that received the
NextNav beacons and computed their location. The received signal was attenuated at the output of the RF
antenna by 2 dB to make it more equivalent to the envisioned handset based implementation.
A smartphone was connected to the NextNav receiver (the sleeve) and contained the test application
utilized in creating the events equivalent to an emergency test call. The smartphone placed a call on the
wireless network to include the effect of such RF transmission (although it was not intended for the
placement of an emergency type test call such as 922). It was also used in transmitting the test logs via
wireless data simultaneously to a servers at TechnoCom and NextNav. A smartphone/NextNav combo is
shown in Figure 3.1.1-1.
Figure 3.1.1-1. NextNav Receiver and Smartphone
The software test application (App) running on the smartphone was a key element of the NextNav test
setup; it automated the capture and logging of the indoor location fixes. It also extracted from the
NextNav receiver the computed location at each test point.
3.1.2 Test Configuration
The test configuration for the NextNav technology is shown in Figure 3.1.2-1.

Figure 3.1.2-1. NextNav Indoor Test Configuration
Page 7 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 PrivateIn this test setup no network interfaces were invoked to trigger a test emergency type call. Instead, the
App on the handset instructed the NextNav receiver to perform certain steps that emulated the events that
occur during a positioning session concurrent with an emergency phone call. The concurrent call on the
AT&T Wireless network emulated the effect of simultaneous RF transmission from the handset.
To create a positioning session, the NextNav receiver was turned on and the ON time was recorded by
looking at the time value of RX-ON-ACK message sent out by the firmware of the receiver. The receiver
then received the NextNav beacon signals and processed them to obtain the position. The position fix
time was recorded by looking at the time value of the position message bearing a valid fix. The receiver
was then turned off.
In the NextNav system the Warm-Fix mode was achieved by issuing a Receiver OFF command and then
issuing a Receiver ON at the beginning of a subsequent location session, so that no state, location or other
information was carried over between attempts.
3.1.3 Vendor Data Logs and/or Processing
The NextNav App logged the location fixes locally in a separate file for every “Start Test” button press.
The log was closed at the end of a test session at a given test point. The App also sent via e-mail the
individual test point logs to both NextNav and TechnoCom. At times, especially in difficult settings, the
NextNav test application encountered problems, which resulted in the logs not being automatically e-
mailed. In those cases the TechnoCom field engineer manually e-mailed the logs to NextNav and
TechnoCom between the test points. TechnoCom also encountered situations where a manual restart of
the application was necessary in order to resume test calls at a test point. These cases resulted in multiple
logs that had to be handled carefully.
In addition to computed location coordinates and uncertainty, the log files recorded the relative time
stamps in milliseconds for turning the NextNav receiver on and off (emulating the start and end of a test
call) and of the computed location fix. The absence of an absolute GPS-type time stamp has caused some
challenges in managing the log files and quickly ascertaining the time of the test call during subsequent
analysis. However, this had no impact on the integrity or quality of the results.
3.2 Technology from Polaris Wireless
Polaris Wireless’ technology uses RF pattern matching (RFPM), referred to a times as RF fingerprinting,
uses radio frequency pattern matching to compare mobile measurements (signal strengths, signal-to-
interference ratios, time delays, etc.) against a geo-referenced database of the mobile operator’s radio
environment
3.2.1 Devices Tested
Two standard, off the shelf Nokia C7 2G/3G smartphones locked to 2G (GSM) networks of AT&T and
T-Mobile were tested.
Page 8 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 PrivateFigure 3.2.1-1. Sample of Nokia C7 Handset Used in Testing Polaris’ Technology
3.2.2 Test Configuration
As depicted in Figure 3.2.2-1 the Polaris Wireless test setup consisted of a laptop running Windows XP
with Nemo Outdoor software installed, three handsets, and a Nemo USB key. The approach of using the
laptop with the Nemo monitoring software made it possible to extract the RF measurements observed or
received at the handset in lieu of accessing the L interface inside the wireless carrier network.
b
One of the handsets was locked to T-Mobile 2G (GSM), one was locked to T-Mobile 3G (UMTS), and
one was locked to AT&T 2G (GSM). (Only 2G testing and data analysis was actually performed in this
stage of indoor testing.) The laptop logged the test call related RF data from the test handsets. At the end
of one or more days of testing, these handset logs were forwarded to Polaris for subsequent processing.
This offline process was required because the Polaris position computing platforms were not integrated
into the AT&T or T-Mobile networks serving the Bay Area. This also resulted in some call related
information (available inside the network but not in the handset RF logs) possibly not being available for
processing by the Polaris algorithms.

3.2.3 Vendor Data Logs and/or Processing
Polaris’ data processing was done off line as mentioned above. Polaris was experiencing some delays in
resolving certain issues in the RF data bases it received from the wireless carriers. Rather than receiving
the handset logs on a daily basis from TechnoCom and not being able to process them for several days till
after the database issues were resolved, TechnoCom was instructed to retain the test logs until Polaris
became ready to process them. In the beginning of the field testing period this delay was as much as two
weeks. Toward the end of the testing period the long delays were overcome. Turning around the logs by
Polaris to generate result files was often within 24 hours, although on a few occasions it took several
days.
In its analysis of the result files from Polaris, TechnoCom aggregated the location results from the AT&T
and T-Mobile networks. The results reported in Section 6 of this report are therefore reflective of the
aggregate performance of 2G (GSM).
Page 10 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Private3.3 Technology from Qualcomm
Qualcomm’s AGPS location solution takes advantage of the complementary nature of the GPS satellite
constellation and the terrestrial wireless network. It creates a significant range of solutions depending on
the achievable satellite visibility and network conditions. Because these solutions combine to work as
one, it is viewed as a hybrid solution. This technology was the first commercially available, integrated
wireless AGPS technology; it is very widely deployed and in regular use. It has been field-tested
extensively for E911, albeit generally in an outdoor context.
The types of fixes that can be produced, listed in order of best to worse accuracy, are listed in Table 3.3-1.

3.3.1 Devices Tested
Qualcomm provided 4 commercial handsets that it had purchased from the respective carriers’ stores. No
“custom software upgrades,” nor any special calibration to improve accuracy, were performed. As such,
this was an excellent example of existing technology in its most recent state. The devices used were:
- Sprint: HTC EVO 4G LTE
- Verizon: HTC Droid Incredible 4G LTE
Page 11 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 PrivateFigure 3.3.1-1 Handsets Used in Testing the Qualcomm AGPS Technology
3.3.2 Test Configuration
The handsets were configured to disable WiFi and BlueTooth connections, to remove any possibility of
inadvertent information coming across these data links or contributing to fix accuracy. GPS
measurements were allowed, but not background Android processing. In a true 911 dial situation, the
GPS user privacy settings in the handset are bypassed. The actual testing, however, used dial strings
other than 911 so as not to burden the PSAPs with high volumes of test calls. Commercial software
builds did not allow the “911” string to be changed, so the handsets had to explicitly allow GPS usage in
support of the dialed strings used for test calling. The setting screens for the two handset types are shown
in Figure 3.3.2-1.
Figure 3.3.2-1. Handset Configuration Screens
The carriers have implemented an emulation of 911 testing in their MSC by recognizing a unique dial
string. When this string is dialed, the normal network actions force a phase 1 position fix in the MPC and
a phase 2 position fix in the PDE. This is shown Figure 3.3.2-2 first published in 2000 and in continuous
usage since then.
Commercial builds for MS-Assisted IS-801 call flows implement a “cold start” where all of the necessary
assistance data is derived wholly from each independent PDE call flow and current network time. The PDE
generates GPS assistance data relative to the position of the serving tower. The synchronous CDMA network
transfers highly precise time to the handset. This combination allows very rapid acquisition of satellite ranging
Page 12 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privateinformation, comparable to the usual warm start operation. No prior fix data is used in the calculation, which
assures independent fixes, even though the same handset was used repeatedly at the same location.
The commercial PDEs are configured to allow the handset to search for GPS signals for a maximum of16
seconds, and return back whatever results were obtained at the end of that period. The IS-801 standard
also allows 32 seconds, but this is not used to be compliant with the requested 30 second response time.
Additional time beyond the GPS search time is used for call setup and message transfer.
Figure 3.3.2-2. Network Configuration per J-STD-036 for Emergency Call Processing
3.3.3 Vendor Data Logs and/or Processing
Calls were dialed by an application developed by TechnoCom for that purpose. The application ran on
the four Android handsets and allowed call dialing and hang up time between calls to be timer controlled
and logged. The application created the ‘handset logs’ which were emailed from the handset operated by
TechnoCom personnel directly to TechnoCom; they were not processed by Qualcomm.
The PDE logs were collected by the wireless carriers on a periodic basis and forwarded directly to
TechnoCom with no processing or review by Qualcomm ahead of TechnoCom. The PDE logs recorded
the interaction between the PDE and the handset, and the results of the various stages of the location
process. The logs used were actually extracts from the more detailed PDE BIN files via a tool employed
by the wireless carriers in monitoring their E911 systems.
The two wireless carriers had different internal processes to extract the logs and forward them to
TechnoCom. Because of the tightness of the available time to do the testing and preparation for it, this
resulted in some initial delays as well occasional delays of up to a week in receiving the logs. This
Page 13 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privatecaused some initial delays in processing the data and identifying possible timer issues but had no real
impact on the end results.
4 Test Execution
4.1 Test Point Selection
TechnoCom’s principal engineer/location expert (Dr. K. Dessouky, who is also leading author of the
CSRIC test plan) worked closely with members of the Building sub-group of WG3 to review possible
candidate building selections and suggest additional candidate buildings for contact. The evaluation of
the possible buildings was in the context of the requirements of the test plan. Buildings were evaluated
for their fit into the criteria of selection for each morphology, including their location, their type of
construction, their broad RF characteristics, their distinction from other buildings previously selected, and
their physical and logistical access.
Initial contact with building managers or owners was generally facilitated by public safety membership of
the building sub-group. Upon granting of permission for access/testing, TechnoCom’s principal engineer
performed a walkthrough of each of the identified buildings to determine the appropriate test points. The
test points were selected to meet the general requirements of the test plan with adequate diversity in their
RF environment (including adequate cellular signal coverage), placement of the point in the building, and
non-intrusive test performance. The test points were then documented and pictures taken to ensure that
the ground truth survey team surveyed the specific points intended. At some buildings, access restrictions
implied that the walkthrough, the formal survey, and the actual testing were all coordinated and
performed on the same day.
In all 75 points were selected as suggested in the test plan. Due to real world building availability and
access limitations in the limited time window the eventual test point distribution somewhat favored dense
urban over urban settings. As will be seen in Section 6 of this report, dense urban performance observed
was actually somewhat better than urban performance (in the selected sample of buildings).

Suburban 19
Rural 4
Total 75
The identity and specific location of all the test points were maintained strictly anonymous to all location
technology vendors participating in the test bed. Apart from some members of the building sub-group of
WG3, the identities of the specific buildings were maintained anonymous to the remainder of the test bed
participants. Since the vendors had access to their own location output logs, they could, after a day of
testing, guess the building that was used, but certainly could not guess where exactly, in what part of the
building, or on what floor the test point was, not even for the simplest of buildings where performance
was quite good.
4.2 Ground Truth Determination
A professional land survey company with experience in indoor surveying and local knowledge was
selected by TechnoCom to perform the precise ground truth surveys. The surveyor used established land
Page 14 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privatesurvey techniques using modern technology. The equipment used of the survey inside the buildings is
shown in Figure 4.2-1. The following is a quote form one of the 19 formal survey reports that have been
provided to the funding participants in Stage 1 of the test bed.
"Surveyed positions were established using the Leica RTK GPS spider network and a GNSS receiver.
These positions were established on California State Plane Zone 3 and converted to Latitude and
Longitude. Elevations were established as a GPS Ellipsoidal Height WGS 84 and corrected with Geoid
09. GPS control points were established at each site and transferred into the building sites with a Trimble
S6, 3” robotic total station. The accuracy of the RTK GPS ground control is +/-2cm vertical and +/-1cm
horizontal. The accuracy of the total station interior shots are +/- 1cm. The significant figures of the data
reflect the stated accuracy.”
Figure 4.2-1. Setup Used by Professional Surveyor for Ground Truth Determination
A sample surveyed location took the form:
Building6. Westfield Valley Fair Mall, Santa Clara
Test Point: 1
Description: Lower level, next to store XYZ close to Entrance K
LAT: 37°19'XX.YYY" LONG: -121°56'XX.YYY"
ELEV: 126.7' (38.62 Meters) per Geoid 09
WGS84 ellipsoid height = 19.4' (5.92 Meters)
Although the test points were surveyed with exceptional accuracy and precision, in this as in any similar
field testing with so many devices under test, a practical accuracy in test device placement relative to
surveyed location is better than one meter. The contribution of such placement tolerance to overall
location error is completely negligible.
Page 15 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Private4.3 Test Fixture
For ease of transportation the test devices were mounted on a rolling cart. As shown in Figure 4.3-1 the
cart had three levels with the top level dedicated to the devices under test, the middle level to the laptops
required by the location technology vendors, and the bottom tray to the backup batteries and TechnoCom
data gathering laptops.
The top tray included two NextNav Receiver/smartphone combinations, three handsets from Polaris
Wireless, and four from Qualcomm (two on the Verizon and two on the Sprint network. Each
handset/receiver was mounted using a cradle on a 12” arm. A minimum separation of 10” was
maintained between the different devices (except between the NextNav receiver/smartphone
combination). The approximate height from the ground of the devices on top of the cart was 1.2 meters.
Figure 4.3-1. Test Fixture (Cart) Used During Indoor Testing
Page 16 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Private4.4 Placement of Test Calls
The field testing staff of TechnoCom performed the following steps at a given test point:
1. Coordinated with building management the sequence of access to the various test points
2. Located the room or area in the building containing the target test point.
3. Used the documented notes and pictures to determine the precise location of the test point.
4. Placed a mark on the ground as a reference.
5. Placed the test cart on top of or very close to the marked point for the duration of the test.
6. Took 4 pictures of the test setup from 4 directions, similar to those in the original pictures used as a guide
for point placement.
7. Started the needed warm-up procedures for some of the devices under test
8. Started the test applications for the devices of the various technologies
9. Started the application’s dialer on some applications as needed in a certain order
10. Monitored all the handsets or devices under test to ensure their proper operation
11. As needed reset or restarted some of the applications that failed to respond or place test calls during the
period of time assigned to the test point
12. From time to time during the placement of the test calls partially rotated the test cart or moved it slightly
(about a foot) ensuring it stays essentially over the marked ground truth.
13. Documented any deviations or anomalies observed during the execution of the processes at the test point
14. At some points as needed due to operational issues manually e-mailed or uploaded test call data logs to the
technology vendor
4.5 Time Budget for Test Calls
The above sequence of events implied a certain overhead associated with each test point. The need to
complete 5 or occasionally a maximum of 6 test points in a building in a day, dictated by access
constraints, implied that an hour and a half is allocated to each test point, in which 75 minutes could be
spent placing test calls. (Additional overhead time was consumed in meeting the building management,
familiarizing the building engineering staff with what was needed, and in certain cases obtaining
temporary credentials to permit unfettered access.)
Working backwards it was determined that if one device is used to place 100 calls then the 45 seconds are
needed for each call and pause between calls. This neatly fit with a 30 second on 15 second off cycle.
This is consistent with 30 second de facto requirement for delivery of a location result in an E911
situation. This was possible with certain of the technologies under test, basically when the test
environment was under the complete control of the location technology company, as was the case with
NextNav and Polaris for the configurations tested. Testing AGPS on the operational networks of Verizon
and Sprint wasn’t as straightforward and required some workarounds as will be explained in the next
section.
NextNav and Polaris by design set the length of their call or call equivalent duration (integration period or
measurement period) to be a bit under 30 seconds. The large majority of the NextNav test calls declared
their location result at around 27 seconds. There was very little variation in that number, essentially by
Page 17 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privatedesign. The large majority of Polaris’ test calls declared their location result around 24 seconds. The
standard deviation was relatively small (see TTFF summary results in Section 6.1.3).
Qualcomm AGPS was tested on operation networks with its complexities and these are discussed below.
4.6 Timer Issues Encountered with Operational E911 Networks
Qualcomm used the commercially installed E911 networks of Verizon and Sprint. Both networks
comprise multiple components (MSC, MPC, PDE) that have been built to ensure a high degree of
reliability and redundancy.
The E911 location system has been built with the assumption that 911 is typically dialed once, and that
there is normally a gap before 911 is dialed again from the same phone. Accuracy testing with repeated
calls made by the same phone is an artificial configuration, created by necessity, which can introduce
timing issues among the network elements that are not seen during normal 911 call processing.
Based on limited initial testing prior to the start of formal testing it appeared that a 25 second on/20
second off cycle would work, enabling the possibility of only one handset per wireless carrier network to
collect the required number of calls per test point. As more calls and logs were collected in the first few
days of testing, it was observed that due to the variant production and test network configurations,
repeated calls from the same phone with the fast pacing of 25 on/20 off, appeared to have different
impacts on location calculation within each carrier network. Location and yield issues occurred because
of the nature of the repeated test calls from the same handset, tripping system timers that are in place to
deal with live 911 call throughput. Hence, after the initial test calls were placed and reviewed, the test
call configuration was changed to 30 on/60 off to minimize production timer impacts on test call results.
The use of two handsets on each wireless carrier network enabled the collection of required number of
test calls.
One of the issues that arose during the initial period with the 25 on/20 off spacing with one of the wireless
carrier networks was that cached fixes were delivered on subsequent test calls from the same test device.
This caused a degradation in yield as the first call from a test device received a location fix, but
subsequent location queries for test calls made 20 seconds later on the same device, received the cached
first test call fix and had to be discarded. This is due to the appearance to the production location system
that the query was from the same “emergency call.” At the longer interval of 30 on/60 off, the caching
disappeared and a location fix was generated for each test call.
Another issue encountered pertained to a wireless carrier’s use of a separate test platform which allowed
for the 30-second on time to be long enough that a second position request was initiated at the PDE.
However, the call would then terminate before the GPS measurements have had a chance to be returned.
In that case there were “extra” fixes which had poor performance due to only being network based. The
original 25 second time was “just enough” to let the first fix get completed within the 16 second IS-801
session, and a second fix was not kicked off. But with the 30 second on time, a new fix was started, but
did not have time to complete properly and thus “failed.”
In the end to resolve a number of these timer related issues within the time frame of the test, a robust call
log analysis method was created by TechnoCom to identify the correct “first fix” and ignore the second
(duplicate) fix. This was mostly effective, but may still have left a small percentage of calls with less
than optimal performance due to the repeated calls from the same phone. Overall, though, the timer
related issues where sufficiently mitigated so as not to have significant impact on the overall results.

5.1 Dense Urban Environment
5.1.1 Dense Urban Polygons
The dense urban and urban polygons postulated by the polygon committee of CSRIC WG3 are shown in
Fig. 5.1.1-1. The dense urban polygon is shown in green and the adjacent urban polygon in magenta.
These shapes were considered preferred polygons to initiate the process of searching for different
categories of buildings. Satellite/aerial maps, primarily using Google Earth as a tool, were the primary
source of morphology information, in addition to broad general knowledge of San Francisco.
During the process of building identification in the field and initial site visits, detailed field examination
of the buildings and their density in the area revealed that some modification of the polygon boundaries is
warranted. Specifically, some expansion of the dense urban polygon by one to two blocks, and in two
corners three blocks, better reflects the nature of the area. The dense urban polygon, updated as observed
in the field, is shown in Fig. 5.1.1-2 in light blue. The adjacent urban polygon has also been adjusted
consistent with the refinement of the dense urban polygon.
Figure 5.1.1-1. Dense Urban and Urban Polygons in SF postulated by Polygon Sub-Group
Page 19 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 PrivateFigure 5.1.1-2. Updated Dense Urban and Urban Polygons in SF (as Observed in the Field)
After intense effort by the building committee of WG3 supported by this test contractor (TechnoCom) six
excellent sample buildings were identifed inside the dense urban polygon. There relative locations are
shown in Fig. 5.1.1-3.
Inital site visits to these buildings were performed that resulted in the detailed identification and the test
point sin each of the bbuildings. Indoor testing per the CSRIC test plan was then perfomed at those test
points. Additonally professional land surveying was perfomed to obtain the ground truths with a high
degree of accuracy and precision.
Page 20 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 PrivateFigure 5.1.1-3. Relative Locations of the Test Buildings Used in the Dense Urban Morphology
5.1.2 Dense Urban Buildings Used
The dense urban buildings used for indoor testing in this stage of the test bed were:
Bldg. 1: Marriott Marquis Hotel, SF
Bldg. 2: One Front Street, SF
Bldg. 3: 201 Spear Street, SF
Bldg. 14: The Hearst Office Building (699 Market Street), SF
Bldg. 15: The Omni Hotel, SF
Bldg. 16: One Embarcadero Plaza, SF
The sample of these 6 dense urban buildings selected for testing provided an excellent representation of
building types in such a dense city environment. Distinct common building types were included. Steel
buildings with glass, concrete and masonry with glass, brick veneer (in the East Coast tradition), tall
buildings over 40 stories high, medium height buildings of around 15 stories high, and buildings
surrounded by other tall buildings on all sides and on fewer sides were all represented. In addition, the
geography of the City of San Francisco, on the tip of the peninsula, made for challenging cellular
Page 21 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privatepropagation, at times experiencing signals from across the Bay (e.g., Pt. 2 in BD3 had a clear view of the
Bay Bridge and beyond, and Pt.1 on the 42nd floor of BD16 had far reaching visibility across the bay to
the north and the city of SF to the south). These are not unusual conditions in a dense city with high rises
but they may be more difficult than in a flat city away from the water. The sample of buildings selected
and the range of test points chosen in each building therefore offered a wide and challenging cross section
of real world situations in which wireless calls could be placed.

5.2.1 Urban Polygons
The urban polygon in San Francisco contains varied building densities and construction types that range
from larger commercial buildings (near the downtown dense urban polygon), to older mixed-use
neighborhoods with medium and smaller sized buildings (both commercial and residential in the middle
of urban clutter), as well as newer, redeveloped areas with medium height residential and commercial
buildings, city government buildings, and a large stadium. The San Francisco urban polygon is typical of
an “older urban” area with densely packed construction (regardless of building height), somewhat
narrower streets, and similar or narrower building separation than the dense urban polygon.
Figure 5.2.1-1. Relative Locations of the Test Buildings Used in the Urban Morphology in SF
Page 28 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 PrivateThe urban polygon in San Jose is representative of “newer urban” development, with a downtown typified
by tall buildings of up to 30 stories, but with somewhat wider streets and somewhat greater building
separation than in older urban or dense urban morphologies.
Figure 5.2.1-2. Urban Polygon in San Jose and Location of Building Selected in It
Page 29 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Private5.2.2 Urban Buildings Used
The urban buildings used for indoor testing in this stage of the test bed were:
Bldg. 4: AT&T Park (baseball stadium), SF
Bldg. 5: Moscone Convention Center, SF
Bldg. 17: US Federal Court of Appeals Building, SF
Bldg. 18: Super 8 Motel on O’Farrell St., SF
Bldg. 19: The 88 San Jose (condominium building), SJ
These five buildings offered a challenging environment, each in their own way. The convention center
had large areas under the surface of the street, with excellent internal cellular coverage but considerable
attenuation when viewed from the outside (e.g., by a beacon). The baseball stadium on the bay (BD4)
offered a challenging RF signal environment. The US Court of Appeals building (BD17) is a heavily
constructed masonry structure (that survived the famous 1906 earthquake) with considerable use of tile on
the inside. The motel (BD18), although not itself large or high, is sandwiched in a row of continuous side
to side five story urban buildings, with higher buildings across the street and down the corner. Finally, the
high rise in urban San Jose presented its own challenges in having considerable visibility to the whole
valley from its high floors and the presence of tall buildings within a few hundred yards. The
combination of buildings selected created a solid, challenging urban sample that represents well beyond
California.

The suburban polygon of Silicon Valley includes a variety of suburban office buildings, industrial and
commercial complexes, government buildings, and a range of residential buildings, including single and
multi-family dwellings. Also included in the suburban polygon are shopping malls, large discount retail
buildings and an airport.

Bldg. 9: City Library, Santa Clara
Bldg. 10: Senior Center, Santa Clara
Bldg. 11: 1405 Civic Center, Santa Clara
Page 34 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 PrivateThis suburban building sample contained smaller, lighter constructed buildings common in the Southwest
as well as an office building and a major mall. The latter two structures could be found in virtually any
part of the US. In all cases significant relative space existed between the tested structure and its
neighbors, reflecting the lower density suburban setting.

5.4.1 Rural Polygon
The rural polygon is located in the area between Gilroy and Hollister, and is characterized by large
farming tracts, isolated residences and limited commercial development. Of particular note is the low
density of cell sites due to distances and the intervening terrain on the periphery of the area. The low
cellular site density was a key factor in the selection of this polygon, which is about 40 miles south of
downtown San Jose.
Figure 5.4.1-1. Rural Polygon and Location of Buildings Used
5.4.2 Rural Buildings Used
The rural buildings used in this stage of the test bed are:
Bldg. 12: Gilroy Gaits, green building (riding stable with metal roof), Hollister, CA
Bldg. 13: Gilroy Gaits, beige building (riding stable with metal roof), Hollister, CA
Page 38 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 PrivateThis selection of rural buildings used was influenced by the paucity of available building in the defined
rural polygon (a selection that was driven by a desired lower cell site density). The lack of public-like
buildings in the area compounded the difficulty. The chosen buildings are both large one story buildings
with metal roofing, which is a common combination in rural operations. They generally represent a more
challenging environment than a rural home, whose performance would be more similar to a suburban
home, e.g., BD 8, or other smaller apartment type structure like BD10.

6.3.1.6.1 Building 16 Environment and Test Points:
Building 16 is One Embarcadero Center, SF, which is one of a group of four high rise buildings in that
commercial center. One Embarcadero is the furthest west. It’s surrounded with high rises more on its
Page 135 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privatesouth than north side. It towers above the buildings in its immediate vicinity. This is particularly
significant here because two test point were on the 42 floor, which is a floor reserved for building
engineering, and it is higher than the buildings immediately around it, and consequently with excellent
sky visibility. That floor is also narrower than lower floors in the building.
TP1: Engineering workshop; 42 floor, many windows
TP2: 42 floor hallway; obscured windows
TP3: Office 2929; window office on 29th floor
TP4: Next to entrance lobby, under plaza roof
TP5: 3rd floor interior hallway

6.3.3.4.1 Building 9 Environment and Test Points:
Building 9 is the Santa Clara City Library. It is a sizeable 2-story suburban building of wood construction
with good size windows and a significant amount of glass in its façade. The test points avoided the area
near that façade of the building.
TP1: Interior corridor between offices, 1st floor
TP2: By employee elevator in parking garage, one level below main library hall.
TP3: Outside room with windows, 1st floor
TP4: Interior space near employee break room, 2nd (top) floor
During the analysis phase it was recognized that TP2 had severely unreliable signal reception that
resulted in extremely low yield by all technologies under test. This point was therefore omitted from the
statistical analysis of the data, and was the only test point among the entire set of 75 points where this was
warranted.

Identifying buildings in the rural polygon that was defined by the polygon sub-working group within
CSRIC proved to be a major challenge. After considerable attempts at identifying buildings in that sparse
rural area it was concluded that utilizing two buildings within the envelope of one large rural property
was the most feasible approach within the strict lime limitations of the testing campaign.
6.3.4.1 Buildings 12 and 13:
6.3.4.1.1 Buildings 12 and 13 environment and test points:
The two buildings are shown in the figure below. Both are large riding stable buildings, with metal roofs,
and considerable interior space allowing for the selection of test points reflecting distinct scenarios.

Page 294 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 PrivatePage 295 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 PrivatePage 296 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Private7 Summary Observations on the Test Results
7.1 Dense Urban Environment
The results for the dense urban buildings highlighted the challenges that satellite signals have in
penetrating to those points that are in the interior of large buildings. Consequently, AGPS fall-back
modes, such as AFLT, were experienced frequently. Accuracy degraded as expected when GPS fixes
were not attained. While a surprising proportion of hybrid fixes were experienced, even at test points
where one would not expect a satellite signal to penetrate, the quality of the hybrid fixes was in general
significantly degraded compared to GPS fixes. Hence, in many dense urban test points (and in urban
buildings as well) a significant amount of spread in location fixes was observed. This often extended over
a number of city blocks. Few very poor fixes are seen in the dense urban case, perhaps because the high
cell site densities (and consequently small cell radii) in the dense urban core create a reasonable lower
bound on fall-back accuracy.
In contrast to the challenges that GPS signals face in the dense urban setting, RF finger printing
experienced its best performance in the dense urban setting. This is probably a combination of a confined
environment that could be extensively calibrated and many RF cell sites and handoff boundaries that
could be leveraged in creating a good RF fingerprint map of the dense urban center.
The best observed performance in the dense urban setting was that of the dedicated terrestrial (beacon)
location system—a new infrastructure. With this level of accurate location performance it is actually
possible to discern some of the vagaries caused by multipath. Oftentimes, when the test point is floors
below the roof and in an outside room with windows, the signal is forced to propagate from the handset
out (or by reciprocity in) towards or from a building that is across the street or a few blocks away (if the
space between it and the test point is open). The signal then propagates to (or from) the location
infrastructure, whether terrestrial beacons or satellites. The result is that location fixes that may be
relatively close in absolute distance (e.g., 40 m away) are often located in a building across the street, in a
neighboring building, or even across a few blocks from the test point. (See for example, BD3_TP1,
BD14_TP3 and BD15_TP4 for NextNav. This phenomenon will become even more obvious in the urban
setting.)
7.2 Urban Environment
As mentioned above in Section 5.2.2, the specific test buildings used in the urban morphology were
challenging, each in their own way. This is because each building represented more distinctly a building
type and setting than the high rises of the dense urban environment.
The baseball stadium by the San Francisco Bay (BD4, AT&T Park) created a situation where AGPS
fallback fixes could be very far away due to the very exposed RF propagation outside the structure in
which the test points were located. This impacted points that were relatively deep inside the stadium
building. The structure of the stadium also appears to have created challenges to RF fingerprinting at
some test points.
The convention center created in some cases an environment that was deep indoors but with very strong
cellular signal from cell sites inside the building (including a DAS). This situation was captured by two
points of different depth (BD5_TP2 and BD5_TP3). This situation resulted in the beacon-based location
system performing poorer than in most other test points, since attenuation to different directions in the
outside world was particularly strong in those scenarios. AGPS and RF fingerprinting relied on the cell
sites inside the structure to create adequate location fixes.
The US Court of Appeals Building (BD17) represented a classic older, heavy construction, but also had a
very large atrium in its middle. Results varied depending heavily on the degree of distance from windows
or the central atrium. Again, the phenomenon of apparent location in a building across the street is seen
here (e.g., BD17_TP2 for both NextNav and Qualcomm, which was a test point inside a large court room
Page 297 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privatewith windows in the direction of the building across the street). As one would expect, the degradation
caused by being away from a window or atrium more significantly impacted the satellite based system
than the terrestrial beacon based one. RF fingerprinting fixes appeared to cluster about the larger
reflectors in this urban corner of San Francisco, which happened to be mostly across the streets from the
target building.
The motel building (BD18) provided a very clear example of relatively good location fixes on the basis of
absolute error distance but that are mostly in or around other buildings across the street (e.g., NextNav all
four test points in BD18 .) This phenomenon is primarily caused by the physics of the problem. This
case poignantly demonstrates the unique challenge with indoor location: absolute distances (like 50 or
150 m) which may have meant much in assessing outdoor performance mean less for the indoors, since
emergency dispatch to the wrong building or even the wrong block could be easily encountered at 50 or
150 m. A location across the street is certainly better than one a few or many blocks away but it may still
leave some human expectations unmet. RF fingerprinting for this building generates either fixes around
the immediate vicinity of the building or clustered around major reflectors in the general area or along
streets, presumably where calibration measurements were gathered.
Finally, the tall condominium building in urban downtown San Jose (BD19) demonstrated the mix of
high rise construction causing direct signal attenuation, prominent distant reflectors, plus wide area cell
site visibility. All combined to create relatively poor AGPS performance, uneven beacon system
performance, and RF fingerprinting performance that degraded with the height of the test point.
All of the above factors related to each of the urban buildings, combined with a generally lower cell site
density for fall back (than in dense urban), resulted ultimately in an aggregate urban performance that is
slightly worse than the dense urban performance. Still, this overall performance is representative of the
challenges of the big city with high structural density, whether it be San Francisco or a city in the
Northeast or the Midwest.
7.3 Suburban Environment
The effect of smaller buildings with lighter construction and more spacing between buildings is
immediately evident on the quality of the location fixes in the suburban environment. This is most clearly
demonstrated in the case of individual houses or small apartment buildings. Outstanding GPS
performance, almost as good as outdoors, can be achieved inside single story homes (see BD8). The
majority of the GPS fixes fall inside the small home or its small lot. Almost as good a performance is
achieved inside the upper floor of relatively small buildings with composite or tile roof material (see
BD10_PT1, BD11_PT1). CDF’s that are tightly packed at small error values (well below 50 m) signify
this type of outstanding performance. Similarly outstanding performance is achieved on average by the
beacon based location technology under similar circumstances. RF fingerprinting appears to suffers from
performance degradation compared to more dense morphologies in the city. It is able to identify only the
part of the neighborhood where the test calls originated, with spreads over a few to several blocks, and
fixes that are frequently clustered or spread along roads where calibration was performed (e.g., BD8,
BD9, BD10).
The AGPS performance predictably changes as the suburban buildings become bigger and higher. Test
points that are not on the top floor have significantly more positioning error and spread about them as fall-
back modes are more frequently the solution. The terrestrial beacon-based network continues to perform
well in the larger suburban buildings (e.g., BD6, BD7). The phenomenon of positioning at the nearest
building is only occasionally seen (basically when the propagation physics force it to happen, which is not
common in the suburban environment). One example where this is seen is the parking structure
(BD7_PT5) where the location signals are forced to tunnel through the garage entrance and bounce off the
side of the adjacent building. Curiously, GPS appears to perform well in this specific scenario, perhaps
because the parking structure had only 2 floors. RF finger printing shows some enhancement relative to
the smaller suburban buildings, but still shows most of the location fixes along the roads, highways or
reflecting buildings.
Page 298 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Private7.4 Rural Environment
As mentioned in Section 5.4.2, the building chosen for the rural environment where limited by what was
accessible in the available time. Both buildings selected were large one story structures with metal roofs.
Performance of AGPS reflected the effect of the metal roof and some metal siding in limiting the
available number of satellite signals available for trilateration at certain test points. In these cases more
hybrid fixes were experienced with a concomitant increase in the spread of the location fixes about the
true location (e.g., BD13_TP2 and to a lesser extent BD12_TP1). In easier rural scenarios where metallic
surfaces or multiple floors are not present, e.g., in a rural house, the expected performance would be very
good similar to that seen in a suburban home, like BD8, or a small structure like BD11.
The performance of the beacon based network was less impacted by the metallic roof (since that roof had
more impact on sky visibility rather than on side visibility towards terrestrial beacons). Consequently the
performance was somewhat better than for AGPS. The performance of the beacon based network would
of course depend on the density of its deployed beacons covering the rural area, which was sufficient in
the case of the rural test polygon.
RF finger printing showed reduced performance relative to the suburban environment due to the large
spacing between surveyed roads (where calibration is done) and the rural structures as well as the lower
density of cell sites. The location fixes are spread along relatively long stretches of the rural roads.
Page 299 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Private8 Lessons Learned and Considerations for the Future
This section summarizes the lessons learned from TechnoCom’s participation in the test bed as the
independent test house. These lessons are presented from TechnoCom’s perspective rather than more
broadly from a CSRIC Working Group perspective. They are presented together with specific
recommendations or suggestions aimed at for future test bed campaigns.
It should be kept in mind while reading these paragraphs that TechnoCom has been an active participant
in CSRIC WG3. A number of the challenges cited below were easier to overcome because TechnoCom’s
project lead was an active member of CSRIC and of a number of its sub-working groups.
One of the biggest challenges to face CSRIC WG3 and TechnoCom was the very tight timeline in which
the test bed Stage-1 had to be implemented, executed and its result reported. This is reflected in each of
the following major areas where lessons have been learned and recommendations for the future are made.
8.1 Contractual and Project Setup
Setting up the contractual agreements for TechnoCom to serve as the independent test house was its first
major challenge. Despite the remarkable efforts of WG3 in creating a common framework for the project,
which encompassed a contractual template to be followed, a funding commitment beforehand from each
participant, and a common technical statement of work, negotiating the actual contractual terms and
contract language with each participating company was a major undertaking that consumed considerable
energy and time.
Some of the smaller participating companies were agreeable to using the template with very little
modification. That certainly helped expedite the process. Legal and contracts organizations in larger
companies, however, varied in their willingness to adopt such a common template. At times, the template
had to be abandoned for terms and conditions that are familiar to the contracting officers in those
organizations. Often that was the only way to get an agreement signed in the available time frame. At
other times, a hybrid of the common template and a company’s traditional legal forms were created.
Agreement in principle to the common template by the technical representative of a large company to
CSRIC does not imply buy-in from contracts and legal departments. In most cases there was not enough
time for that internal process in a larger company to take place. This meant that the test house had to
expend the effort to negotiate terms similar in spirit to those in the common template agreement. That
process was successful to varying degrees. Cancellation, indemnification, acceptance and payment were
among the thorniest terms to reach formal agreement on. For example, the concept of an independent test
house creating a report that is not necessarily subject to formal acceptance conditions by the client is alien
to many contracting organizations at larger companies.
These contracting complexities meant that TechnoCom, because of its longstanding working relationship
with most of the participants in Stage-1 and its intimate participation in CSRIC, agreed to verbal
commitments when written language was an impediment to timely project launch and execution. Two
factors were very helpful in this regard: (1) the acceptance by all that the SOW would be unchanged as a
pre-condition for participation, and (2) the promise of up-front payment to the test house by the
participants, although this sometimes did not get reflected in written agreements.
In a future test bed it is strongly recommended that enough time be allowed for a common legal
agreement to be more formally accepted by all companies participating. This needs significantly more
than 3 or 6 weeks and it needs to be started very early, immediately upon expression of interest to
participate by the individual companies. The contracts or purchasing departments of companies must be
active participants in this process. Companies would potentially be disqualified from participation in the
test bed stage if they unduly delay the common agreement.
Related to the above issue is a company’s commitment to participate and not to withdraw in mid-stream.
The up-front payment condition is very helpful in guaranteeing no harm being imparted on the rest of the
Page 300 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privateparticipants. TechnoCom views this as a critical element for the ability of the test house to perform its
duties without being unduly influenced by the potentially changing views within participating companies.
8.2 Test Planning
One of the most challenging aspects of Stage-1 of the indoor test bed has been the identification of
buildings that meet the required technical selection criteria and which can be accessed for the purposes of
testing within the tight time window of the test bed. Identifying possible buildings using satellite or aerial
imagery, like with Google Earth, is an easier initial step than identifying a receptive point of contact in the
ownership or management structure of that building. That particular step is the most difficult and most
time consuming. It requires the proper introduction, preferably facilitated by local public safety officials,
education on the objectives and the public benefits, continuous project management and coordination, and
a willingness to accommodate the limitations and concerns of building management and/or its
engineering staff, who have little bandwidth in their daily jobs to deal with this type of effort.
Furthermore, the test house has to be able to accommodate the liability insurance requirements of the
building, e.g., meet certain overage limits and add the building management or ownership to the
beneficiaries of the insurance policy. In some cases a written access agreement is required and has to be
developed, which takes additional time and effort. Despite all of these challenges, the eventual set of
buildings selected in Stage-1 was excellent, which is a testimony to the dedication of all who participated
in making the building selection and access process successful.
In a future test bed this aspect of the project should be handled in a more structured and formal approach
than the strictly voluntary way used in Stage-1. Not only is a long lead time imperative, but also
innovative approaches should be put in place to educate building managers and owners, and to incentivize
them to permit access for testing, possibly on a periodic basis. One such idea would be a standing access
agreement (possibly with a local wireless carrier) in which the building receives an honorarium or
convenience fee, such as $500 or $1000 (depending on the size of building) for each day in which testing
takes place.
8.3 Technology Readiness
The compressed project schedule, exacerbated by the lengthy collective decision making process to fund
and participate in the project, and in some cases the lack of visibility of this effort within some
participating organizations, resulted in somewhat inadequate time to: (1) fully validate the readiness of
the technologies for testing in the field, (2) verify and refine their data collection configurations or system
settings, and/or (3) fully establish and formally accept timely data and log handling processes. This
resulted at times in field testing personnel or test house analysts supporting troubleshooting by the
participating companies or supporting investigations into adjustments of test call settings that took place
several days into the testing. Ideally, such engineering efforts should not be done during the formal
period of testing but rather before it. Corralling all participants to be ready on all fronts at the same time
under very tight time constraints is a daunting challenge. More time and a more formal go/no-go gate
process needs to be followed in future comparative indoor test campaigns.
From a technical data perspective, exceptions to agreed-upon data formats that impact engineering
assessment and analysis, such as absence of an accurate absolute time stamp or test device ID inside each
log should be avoided.
8.4 Test Execution
Since access to test buildings is the most challenging aspect of project execution, the number of visits to
each building should be minimized. Ideally no more than two visits would be needed: (1) initial visit and
point selection, and (2) test call placement and formal surveying (if required at a new test point).
However, achieving this objective requires the ability to coordinate well in advanced among multiple
parties. Often this was not possible in Stage-1 because the buildings were not known well in advance. In
fact, final agreement from some buildings was received one or two days only before the test team visit,
Page 301 TechnoCom & CSRIC WG3 Privateand that had to be a multi-team member visit to accomplish all the objectives of point identification,
testing and surveying. In any case, project planners cannot and should not assume perfect efficiency in
terms of trips to the market, time the field testers will be in the market, or cost of travel and
accommodation. Many factors are simply beyond any one party’s control.
From a technical perspective, although the SOW stated a minimum ground truth accuracy of better than 5
m, the benchmark and comparative nature of the test bed requires a more accurate ground truth
determination. It is recommended that horizontal and vertical accuracy better than 1 meter be maintained
at all test points, including any uncertainty in placing the test cart or fixture at the test point.
8.5 Project Scope
Although in theory a number of technologies exceeding 3 or 4 could be tested side by side in the test bed
by employing a scalable test organization, in reality, the complexity of interactions among the
participating companies, as well as the logistics, such as the physical dimensions of a non-obtrusive test
cart or fixture make it very difficult for more than 4 technologies to be tested at the same time. It is
recommended that the number of technologies included in a single test bed campaign be limited to 4.
The number of buildings selected for testing in Stage-1 was 19 and the number of test points within the
buildings 75. Based on the variety of scenarios that were observed, the field experience with the
buildings used, and the nature of the results obtained, this number of buildings was appropriate. More
would be better but would make the project progressively more expensive and more difficult to execute in
a timely manner. The ideal breakdown of a 19 or 20 building selection would include 6 dense urban, 6
urban, 5 or 6 suburban, and 2 rural buildings. The maximum recommended number of test points per
building is 5 so as to perform the test call placement from all points in the building in one day.
Regardless of the exact number of buildings and test points, a large amount of test data is required to
create statistically valid samples and to draw definitive conclusions from the indoor testing. It would be
easy for a test house to under-estimate the amount of effort required for the data analysis and for
generating a high quality report, containing varying degrees of detail, which benefits a wide range of
stakeholders. Care should be taken to avoid such possibilities in the future.
8.6 Test Bed Region
The San Francisco Bay Area, despite being a relatively expensive place to perform testing, proved to be
an outstanding environment to support the requirements of the indoor testing. It provided ample
opportunity to create representative morphology polygons and to find potential candidate buildings to
meet the technical requirements of the test plan. It also had an extensive travel infrastructure and a
pervasive wireless coverage that made indoor testing more feasible.
8.7 Test Bed Continuity
Stage-1 of the test bed contained in the end only 3 technologies to test. With the complexity of the task at
hand, this created a good learning opportunity for both CSRIC WG3 members and the test house.
However, there are a number of technologies that are either in use for location based services (LBS) or
that are emerging which should be evaluated for their potential to contribute to the improvement of indoor
wireless E911.
Indoor wireless E911 is a critical public safety issue that will only increase in magnitude; it fully deserves
the focus and continued forward momentum that a test bed stimulates.
