Human factors ABSTRACT  
The paper aims to analyse and assess cybersecurity competencies and define the recommended 
solutions to improve the human factor in cybersecurity. The article presents the results of theo-
retical and empirical research that were carried out in 2019 –2021. The research subject consti -
tutes one of the priorities of many countries and international organisations. Cybersecurity is one 
of the essential foundations for implementing the idea of sustainable development. A cyberse -
curity analysis using a layered structure was proposed in the theoretical part. Empirical research 
was conducted using a diagnostic poll method based on a survey. The presentation of the research 
results includes an analysis of statistical dependencies. The paper presents the research results on 
cybersecurity competencies in the field of threats to state cyberspace and methods of securing and 
protecting data. An important element of the research was to identify forms of education that can 
be used to achieve greater efficiency in increasing cybersecurity competencies. The result of the 
implementation of the research objectives was the development of recommended solutions 
facilitating the improvement of the human factor in the field of cybersecurity.   
1.Introduction 
Over the last few years, there has been a continuous development of information and communication technologies that determine 
the nature of changes in the modern world. Progressive computerisation and the transfer of activities to cyberspace are inherent 
aspects of the functioning of individuals, organisations, states and the international community. These elements have become the 
target of developing countries and a distinguishing feature of countries highly developed (e.g., Appiah-Otoo & Song, 2021 ; Vu, 
Hanafizadeh, & Bohlin, 2020 ). Many strategic documents of global political actors recognise the need for further development of the 
information society, cyberspace, and new technologies (e.g., Mitomo, Fuke, & Bohlin, 2015 ). 
The effectiveness of implementing the above assumptions, including the idea of sustainable development, depends on many factors, 
one of which is the need to ensure cybersecurity (e.g. Vasiu & Vasiu, 2018 ). The achievement of goals related to further technological 
progress requires ensuring the security of data and services implemented in cyberspace. According to the studies of European Union 
agencies, national reports and publications of commercial companies concerned with cybersecurity, the scale of incidents in cyber -
space has a growing tendency (e.g., ENISA, 2019a ; Europol, 2019 ; WEF, 2020a ). Cyberspace threats are becoming more sophisticated 
and encompass a wide variety of attack methods and techniques. Cyberspace is, therefore, an environment of positive and negative 
cooperation because it not only creates conditions for broadly understood progress but is also a source or target of threats. Ensuring

2technological development with the simultaneous need to ensure cybersecurity is a significant challenge. This issue is reflected in the 
strategies and legal acts of many countries and international organisations (e.g., O.J. EU L 191/1, 19.7.2016, July 6, 2016). 
Cybersecurity is an interdisciplinary issue because it requires coordinated actions in the technological, legal, organisational, 
procedural and social areas. At the same time, many studies recognise that the human factor is the weakest link in a cybersecurity 
system. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) emphasises that increasing the level of skills and knowledge is an 
indispensable element in building society’s resilience to cyberspace threats (e.g., ENISA, 2017). The need to improve competencies in 
the discussed area is one of the targets of many countries and international organisations. In recent years, there has been a growing 
interest in the issue of cyber hygiene, which allows avoiding a large number of security incidents. The analysed subject area also covers 
strategic research and development priorities of the European Union in the field of cybersecurity (e.g., ENISA, 2018). 
The outlined context shows the need for research on cyberspace security in the social aspect. This article presents the results of 
theoretical and empirical research that allowed for the evaluation of competencies in the field of cybersecurity. The conducted 
research made it possible to identify problem areas and indicate recommended solutions to improve cybersecurity competencies in a 
systemic approach. 
2.Methodological foundations of theoretical and empirical research on cybersecurity competencies 
The research subject is competencies in the aspect of cybersecurity. In this context, it is essential to diagnose the actual condition as 
well as to identify the relationships and dependencies between the subject of research and cyberspace security. Due to the above, it is 
reasonable to detail the subject of research with the following elements (Sienkiewicz, 2013):  
- identification of the phenomenon, i.e. the distinguished fragment of reality that constitutes the object-subject of cognition,  
- definition of the system, i.e. a complex object in which the phenomenon is realised, or is a driving force affecting how phenomena 
appear;  
- determination of the process realised in the system, i.e. an ordered set of states and/or events which constitute the cause or effect of 
the phenomenon;  
- evaluation of the risk of value loss as a result of the occurrence of a threat (as an element of safety management). 
The research subject described by the phenomenon, system, process and value was concretised in the research as indicated in 
Table 1. 
The main aim of the research is to assess cybersecurity competencies and to define recommended solutions for the policy that will 
help to minimise the risk of threats caused by the vulnerability of the human factor. 
The following objectives were defined in the research:  
- explaining the essence of cybersecurity,  
- determining the impact of competencies on cybersecurity,  
- identifying policy challenges for cybersecurity competencies,  
- analysis of the results of empirical research on cybersecurity competencies,  
- developing solutions that will facilitate the raising of cybersecurity competencies. 
The implementation of theoretical considerations results from the need to adopt scientifically justified criteria for assessing 
competencies in the field of cybersecurity. Moreover, a review of the literature in the context of the research’s main aim allows for the 
specification of dependent and independent variables necessary to implement empirical research. It was assumed that empirical 
research would contribute to the identification of problem areas relating to the researched issues. As a result of the realisation of the 
research objectives, it is possible to develop recommended solutions to increase cybersecurity competencies. 
The main research problem was formulated as the following question: What is the importance of cybersecurity competencies, and 
what recommendations can be made for telecommunications policy to minimise the risk of threats from human factor vulnerabilities? 
Based on the main research problem, areas of theoretical and empirical research as well as specific research problems have been 
distinguished. Table 2 shows the methods and expected effects that led to the formulation of policy recommendations.

3The specified research subject and formulated research objectives cover issues in many areas of knowledge, including technical 
sciences, social sciences, law, and management sciences. Therefore, a research process model appropriate for systemic analysis was 
adopted, which enables to perform the analysis of the phenomena holistically. In theoretical research, the literature analysis and 
synthesis on the subject, legal acts, and reports were used. 
Empirical research was carried out using the diagnostic poll method based on a survey. The survey was conducted among 1520 
respondents. The research covered respondents from the enterprise sector. The selection of the research sample was random, which 
was carried out based on the available database of companies. The research tool was a questionnaire in printed and electronic form. 
The survey questionnaire contained questions about socio-demographic characteristics and competencies in the field of cybersecurity, 
which covered such areas as: threats and methods of cyber-attacks, security and data protection in cyberspace, improvement of 
competencies in the area of cybersecurity. For the purposes of the research, it was assumed that it is justified to examine the statistical 
relationships between the answers provided and the socio-demographic characteristics. Random selection of the research sample made 
it possible to apply selected methods of statistical analysis (e.g., Singh, 2006). The presentation of the research results includes an 
analysis of statistical dependencies. The research used the r-Pearson correlation coefficient, the Chi-2 test of independence and the C 
Pearson’s contingency coefficient.

43.The theoretical basis of cybersecurity in the social aspect 
3.1. The essence and elements of cybersecurity 
There are many definitions of cyberspace security in the literature on the subject and in legal acts. Depending on the field of science 
and the analysed cybersecurity context, the emphasis is on the technical, legal, organisational and many other aspects. An overview of 
selected definitions of cybersecurity is presented in Table 3. 
The interpretations presented in Table 3 take into account essential aspects related to cybersecurity and emphasise the mechanisms 
associated with ensuring cyberspace protection against potential threats. In technical sciences, many formal models relating to ICT 
security have also been developed, e.g., the Bell-LaPadula model (e.g., Bell & LaPadula, 1973), the Biba model (e.g., Biba, 1975), the 
Graham-Denning model (e.g., Graham & Denning, 1972), the Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman model (e.g., Harrison, Ruzzo, & Ullman, 1976). 
From the point of view of research issues, it is legitimate to analyse cybersecurity considering the social aspect of cyberspace. In this 
context, on a highly generalised level, the cybersecurity layers presented in Fig. 1 can be distinguished. 
The strategic layer presented in Fig. 1 covers issues related to legislation, standardisation and shaping cybersecurity strategies at 
the international, national and individual public and private levels. Therefore, this layer has a significant impact on the organisation of 
a cybersecurity system, defining the principles of its functioning, and it constitutes a regulator of the rights and obligations of cy-
berspace users (e.g., Kosseff, 2019). The essential elements of this layer include EU institutions and bodies, EU member states in-
stitutions and bodies, standardisation organisations. Examples of achievements that have had a significant impact on cybersecurity 
include the Regulation on the protection of personal data (GDPR regulation) (O.J. EU L 119/1, 4.5.2016, April 27, 2016) and the 
Directive on measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (NIS Directive) (O.J. 
EU L 191/1, 19.7.2016, July 6, 2016). The aforementioned legal acts established the principles of cybersecurity protection and 
obligated EU member states to develop adequate national strategies and cooperation at the EU level (e.g., Markopoulou, Papakon -
stantinou, & de Her, 2019). The implementation of EU solutions to the national legal order has significantly contributed to increasing 
cybersecurity and privacy protection (Szczepaniuk, Szczepaniuk, Rokicki, & Klepacki, 2020). The rules set out in the strategic layer 
affect the organisation of a cybersecurity system in public and private institutions, which includes defining the principles of human 
resource management and shaping education in the field of cybersecurity. 
The technical layer includes a wide range of hardware and software security measures as well as physical protection measures. 
Currently, top-rated are, for example, antivirus programs, Firewall, IDS/IPS systems. It should be emphasised that cyberspace is an 
evolving and complex system because several paradigms of its development can be distinguished, related to the popularisation of next 
generations of the Internet and new technologies (e.g., Liu et al., 2019; Robison & Crenshaw, 2002). The popularisation of a specific 
technology brings about positive changes in users’ quality of life or affects the optimisation of information processes in organisations. 
On the other hand, the development of new technologies also determines the emergence of new vulnerabilities; thus, research on the 
design, implementation and improvement of technical security measures is of great importance (e.g., ENISA, 2018). Relating the above 
considerations to the research subject, the skills of cyberspace users in the scope of the possibility of using technical security measures 
are of fundamental importance. An important issue is conducting scientific research on cybersecurity, a cooperation of the public and 
the private sector in the discussed field, and the development of departments and specialities focused on educating future cybersecurity 
experts. 
The social layer covers cyberspace users, including their rights, duties, knowledge and skills in the field of cybersecurity. It should 
be emphasised that the social layer of cybersecurity can be analysed on many levels. In the literature on the subject, there are studies on 
various aspects of privacy protection in cyberspace (e.g., Geber, Geber, & Volkamer, 2018; Henriksen-Bulmer, Faily, & Jeary, 2019; 
Kim & Kim, 2018). An important point is the assessment of threats to information security that occur as a result of human error or 
intentional human activity. These phenomena may also apply to internal employees of an organisation (e.g., Probst, Hunkel, Dieter, & 
Bishop, 2010). Another area of analysis is cyberspace threats that expose cyberspace users to personal and material damage, e.g., 
ransomware, phishing, identity theft (e.g., Connolly & Wall, 2019; Frauenstein & Flowerday, 2020). Therefore, the main challenge is 
education for security and increasing users’ knowledge about cybersecurity rules (e.g., Franke & Brynielsson, 2014; Person et al.,

The strategic, technical and social layers are interrelated and interdependent. The essence of cybersecurity can be seen as a state 
and a process in which the elements that constitute cyberspace are characterised by “the ability to protect against current and future 
disruptions (threats) to the functioning or loss of certain values - the system is resistant toward threats (internal, external, accidental, 
intentional) ” (Szczepaniuk, Szczepaniuk, Rokicki, & Klepacki, 2020 ). 
From the point of view of research issues, it is reasonable to detail the social aspect of cybersecurity with the following 
requirements:  
 legal documents create conditions for the organisation of a cybersecurity system, which takes into account the improvement of the 
human factor (including departments and specialities related to cybersecurity, shaping social awareness, standards in the field of 
employee training);  
 the legislation provides legal protection of cyberspace users, including the protection of privacy;  
 an appropriate cybersecurity organisation ensures the security of information and services at the assumed level of confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability;  
 research and education in the field of cybersecurity is in development; 
 an appropriate cybersecurity organisation minimises the risk of security incidents caused by deliberate activities of the organi -
sation ’s employees;  
 cyberspace users are aware of threats and are not susceptible to them,  
 cyberspace users have skills in the aspect of the use of technical security measures that ensure at least the minimum-security 
requirements;  
 the perpetrators of incidents have limited possibilities of using cyberspace to generate threats by utilising the vulnerability of the 
human factor. 
According to the systemic approach, the improvement of a cybersecurity system is equivalent to the desired shaping of all the 
considered elements (e.g., Sienkiewicz, 1989 ). The vulnerabilities that create conditions for the appearance of a threat or a security 
incident may occur in the strategic, technical or social layer. 
3.2. The importance of competencies and cyber hygiene in ensuring cybersecurity 
The growing number of cyberattacks that exploit the vulnerability of the human factor determines the need to raise competencies in 
the area of cybersecurity. Moreover, digital competence is an essential element of implementing the idea of sustainable development 
(s.g, Sharma et al., 2016 ). ENISA underlines that raising knowledge and competencies is essential to the improvement of cybersecurity 
in the European Union (ENISA, 2020a ). A similar position can be observed in NATO ’s activities, which created the Cybersecurity 
Collaboration Hub, to exchange experiences and training. 
Competency is defined differently depending on the discipline. Moreover, within one discipline, one can also find different in-
terpretations of a discussed category (e.g., Schoon, 2009 ). In the literature on the subject, some definitions link competency with the 
effectiveness of action in a given field. In other approaches, competencies are related to collecting many different abilities, skills, and 
traits (e.g., Raven & Stephenson, 2001 ; Szczepaniuk, 2019 ). The article assumes that cybersecurity competencies relate to a combi -
nation of knowledge, skills, and attitudes to ensure cybersecurity. Having competencies in the discussed area determines the

6effectiveness of the unit’s actions in decision-making situations related to ensuring cybersecurity and minimising the risk of security 
incidents. 
The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) established the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), 
which is a forum for collaboration between government, academia and the private sector. NICE has developed the Cybersecurity 
Competency Model, which is an attempt to define, classify and normalise knowledge, skills and attitudes related to cybersecurity 
(Whitman, 2018 ). The model is presented as a pyramid consisting of several levels (Fig. 2). 
The model presented in Fig. 2 consists of levels covering basic competencies (levels 1–3), industry competencies (levels 4–5) and 
higher-level competencies representing a specialisation in a given occupation. In the document specifying the model, measures and 
indicators for assessing specific competencies groups are distinguished additionally (Cybersecurity Competency Model, 2019 ). The 
elements included in the model may constitute a reference point for the analysis and assessment of competencies in the field of 
cybersecurity. 
Evaluation of competencies in the context of the research issues is an essential element of ensuring cybersecurity. Many modern 
cyberattacks exploit the vulnerability of the human factor to cyber threats. Vulnerability analysis and threat identification are critical 
elements of risk management, which is the starting point for assessing and improving a cybersecurity system. Regardless of the adopted 
method of risk management, vulnerabilities are defects or gaps in a security system that facilitate the occurrence of a threat (e.g., 
Antonucci, 2017 ). Risk is expressed in the relationship between the threat and vulnerability and the amount of the effects caused by the 
occurrence of threats. The risk analysis results determine the protection requirements adopted in the form of security measures that 
minimise the risk (Szczepaniuk, Szczepaniuk, Rokicki, & Klepacki, 2020 ). Therefore, the purpose of vulnerability analysis and threat 
identification is to organise a system that will respond to cybersecurity challenges. 
It should be emphasised that the vulnerabilities and the resulting threats may occur in all elements of cyberspace or a cybersecurity 
system. Therefore, the vulnerabilities that may be indicated are, among others, software, physical, infrastructural, organisational, 
procedural or personal vulnerabilities. Considering the elements presented in Figs. 1 and 2, Table 4 shows examples of vulnerabilities 
and threats in relation to the human factor. 
The impact of the human factor on vulnerabilities and threats can be analysed, among others, in terms of the organisation ’s security 
or the personal security of a cyberspace user. Kraemer and Carayon proposed the Human Factor Vulnerability Analysis (HFVA) 
methodology, which enables the study of employees ’ vulnerability, including technical vulnerabilities (Kraemer & Carayon, 2003 ). 
The methodology is limited to two vulnerability categories, but it can be used to identify security vulnerabilities and analyse security 
breaches. 
Hadlington investigated the relationship between Internet addiction, impulsiveness and human vulnerability to risky behaviour in 
the aspect of cybersecurity. One of the study ’s important findings was to show that employees ’ personality traits and attitudes can 
affect the effectiveness of involvement in cybersecurity (Hadlington, 2017 ). 
Wang conducted a study assessing users ’ knowledge and behaviour in the area of cybersecurity on the example of the threat of 
phishing. The obtained results indicated that there is a relationship between the knowledge and the behaviour of end-users in the 
aspect of utilising anti-phishing solutions (Wang, 2013 ). Phishing also often depends on the knowledge of human attitudes and the use 
of human vulnerabilities (Dodge, Carver, & Ferguson, 2007 ). 
ENISA emphasises that in the last several years, activities facilitating cybersecurity consisted mainly in the technical security of

7systems and devices. The importance of the human factor in the cybersecurity system was limited primarily by procedures and 
sanctions (ENISA, 2019b). It may have contributed to the low competencies in cyberattack prevention. 
The scientific literature and initiatives of many countries and international organisations began to notice the need to improve 
cybersecurity competencies. In this context, the concept of “cyber hygiene” has emerged, which means knowledge and behaviour 
aimed at reducing risky behaviours in cyberspace (Neigal, Claypoole, Waldfoogle, Acharya, & Hancook, 2020). A proper level of cyber 
hygiene reduces the system’s vulnerability to threats and includes the ability to prevent a potential attack (e.g., Kalhoro, Rehman, 
Ponnusamy & Shaikh, 2021). Cyber hygiene refers to a set of rules and behaviours that, if followed, increase the safety of individual 
users and have a positive impact on an organisation. 
Competencies are essential in ensuring cybersecurity. Both the lack of knowledge or the lack of appropriate skills can contribute to 
the occurrence of cyber threats. Cyberspace is a subject of further evolution; therefore, it is important to improve competencies to 
minimise the risk of threats. Promoting cyber hygiene principles can help to avoid a large number of security incidents. 
3.3. Policy challenges - cybersecurity competencies 
Many strategy documents and policies emphasise the importance of digital technologies for socio-economic development while 
respecting the Sustainable Development Goals. The World Economic Forum report indicated that the computerisation of the public and 
private sectors determines changes in the employment structure. Nowadays, there is a demand for an increase in digital competencies 
among employees (WEF, 2020b). 
The effective implementation of modern technologies requires the implementation of many projects, including ensuring cyber -
security. According to some forecasts, it is estimated that the cost of cybercrime is growing by 15% annually, and by 2025 it could 
reach over $ 10 trillion annually (Morgan, 2021). Therefore, the issue of cybersecurity is a significant global challenge. The United Table 4

Cybersecurity competencies - selected EU regulations.  
Initiative Characteristic 
The Directive on security of network and information 
systems (the NIS Directive)  - The Directive sets out the obligations of the Member States to increase the overall level of 
cybersecurity in the EU.  
- The tasks of the cooperation group include the exchange of information and best practices on 
awareness-raising and training.  
- The document indicates that the national strategy for the security of network and 
information systems should contain guidelines relating to education, information and 
training programs (O.J. EU L 191/1, 19.7.2016, July 6, 2016) 
The Cybersecurity Act  - The Regulation indicates that additional efforts are needed to raise citizens’ awareness of 
cybersecurity.  
- The recommended solution is to promote cyber hygiene in the Member States.  
- ENISA supports the Member States in raising awareness of cybersecurity.  
- ENISA contributes to the promotion of best practices and solutions, including in the field of 
cyber hygiene and digital skills, at the level of citizens, organisations and enterprises.  
- Public information campaigns should spread knowledge about threats such as phishing 
attacks, botnets, financial and banking fraud, data fraud incidents. In addition, security 
methods should be promoted, including multi-level authentication, encryption, anonym -
isation and data protection (O.J. EU L 151, 7.6.2019, April 17, 2019) 
Digital Education Action Plan 2021–2027  - The document concluded that all Member States lack digital experts, including cybersecurity 
analysts.  
- The demand for e-skills will grow, and it will be necessary, among other things, 
competencies in the field of cybersecurity (COM/2020/0624). 
The EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital 
Decade  - The strategy emphasises that cybersecurity competencies are low. In addition, there is a 
significant shortage of cybersecurity skills among employees.  
- Cybersecurity competence and hygiene should underpin the digital transformation (JOIN, 
2020)

8Nations recommends building digital capabilities, including cybersecurity competencies (UN, 2017). At the European Union level, 
there is also a need to improve solutions in this area. Table 5 presents selected regulations and initiatives of the European Union 
concerning, among other things, cybersecurity competence. 
The table above presents selected initiatives of the European Union, which emphasise that achieving an acceptable level of 
cybersecurity requires actions in the legal, technical, physical, and social areas. The documents indicate that the cybersecurity 
competencies are too low. Consequently, a significant policy challenge is the dissemination of knowledge and skills for building 
cybersecurity defence capabilities. 
The European Union regulations have a significant impact on the legal system of the Member States. As a result of the initiatives 
taken, there is an improvement in the level of security of network and information systems in the Member States. Significant 
importance in this regard was played, among others, by detective NIS (Szczepaniuk, Szczepaniuk, Rokicki, & Klepacki, 2020). It can be 
assumed that the analysis of cybersecurity competencies may contribute to the identification of problem areas that will determine 
policy challenges in the studied area. 
4.Empirical research results 
Theoretical considerations lead to the conclusion that insufficient competencies in the field of cybersecurity may generate sig-
nificant vulnerabilities in a security system. For empirical research, it was assumed that vulnerabilities might occur in each layer 
presented in Fig. 1 or Fig. 2. The relationships between the human factor and other cybersecurity system elements were examined in 
this context. 
4.1. Threats to the state cyberspace and methods of conducting cyber attacks 
The survey questionnaire formulated questions about the respondents’ knowledge of threats and selected cyberattacks methods. 
Table 6 presents quantitative data illustrating the respondents’ knowledge of threats to the state cyberspace. 
According to the table above, the respondents’ knowledge of threats may be insufficiently assessed. Most of the respondents are not 
aware of the scale of security incidents caused by the activities of the organisation’s employees or social engineering. The research 
results also showed that many respondents do not know the specifics of such threats as cyberwar or cyber spying. Most of the re-
spondents are aware of the threat of cyberterrorism and cybercrime and can assess the scale of the potential effects of such activities. 
The analysis of the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents and the answers provided allows us to assume that there is 
a relationship between education, age and knowledge of the threats to the state cyberspace. Comparing the quantitative data in in-
dividual groups of the education structure, 85% of people with an academic degree or title know the threats to the state cyberspace. 
Among people with higher education, 68% of respondents showed knowledge in the researched field. According to the level of 
knowledge, the following groups of respondents are as follows in the education structure: secondary - 22%, vocational - 13%, primary - 
11%. Relating the data to the age structure of the respondents, younger people are more aware of the threats to the state cyberspace 
compared to older adults. The percentage distribution in individual age groups in relation to the possessed knowledge is as follows: 
78% (people under 26 years of age), 75% (26–35 years), 66% (36–45 years), 37% (46–55 years), 21% (56–65 years) and 17% (people 
over 65). The tables below present quantitative data and percentage data in terms of knowledge about threats to the state cyberspace, 
taking into account the level of education (Table 7) and the age of the respondents (Table 8). 
The relationship between education, age and knowledge about the risks was investigated using the r-Pearson correlation coeffi -
cient. The value of the correlation coefficient for the studied variables is presented in Table 9, while the scatter diagrams showing the 
correlation between the variable X and the variable Y are illustrated in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. 
The r-Pearson correlation coefficient showed a strong statistical relationship between the examined variables. In the case of the 
influence of education on the respondents’ knowledge, the direction of the relationship is positive, which means that the higher level of 
one variable determines the higher level of the other one. There is a negative correlation between age and the answers given by the 
respondents. 
The next group of questions in the survey questionnaire concerned cyberattacks and malware. Table 10 presents the respondents’ 
knowledge in the discussed area. 
The quantitative data in Table 10 shows that the respondents do not have detailed knowledge about cyberattacks in most cases. The 
survey questionnaires did not include a definition of individual attack methods because one of the research objectives was to evaluate

9the respondents ’ level of knowledge. It should be emphasised that understanding the specifics of individual attacks and malware 
requires specialist knowledge. The analysis of the answers provided showed that most of the respondents were aware of such threats as 
a computer virus or a Trojan horse. The collected material indicates that most of the respondents are not aware of the remaining 
threats. Spoofing, SQL Injection, Redirects, Spyware, and Cryptojacking are among the least known threats. 
Detailed analysis of the collected material made it possible to adopt a hypothesis that there is a relationship between knowledge of Table 7

11Based on the data contained in the table above, a hypothesis can be assumed that there is a relationship between knowledge about 
cyberattacks and malware and the acquired education. It can also be assumed that respondents’ participation in courses and training in 
information security influences their knowledge. The adopted hypothesis was verified with the Chi-2 test. However, the dependency’s 
strength was determined using the C Pearson’s coefficient. The described dependencies are presented in Table 12. 
The results of the Ch-2 test, presented in Table 12, allowed for positive verification of the formulated hypothesis. Pearson’s C 
coefficient indicates a very strong relationship between the studied variables. Both respondents with IT education and persons 
participating in training in the field of information security showed greater knowledge of cyberattacks and malware. 
4.2. Security and data protection in cyberspace 
An important issue is the analysis of data protection methods used in cyberspace by the respondents. The survey questionnaire 
formulated questions about technical security and actions taken for data protection in cyberspace. The study results regarding the 
applied technical protections are presented in Table 13. 
Referring to the above results, it can be stated that the majority of the respondents use such security measures as antivirus (86%), 
firewall (77%) or IDS/IPS systems (62%). A smaller proportion of the respondents use such solutions as VPN (35%), disk encryption 
(33%), e-mail encryption (31%), end-to-end encrypted instant messaging (24%). A small number of respondents use Tor Browser 
(13%), configure the Wi-Fi router to hide the SSID network (11%) and filter allowed clients by MAC address (8%). 
The applied analysis of the answers provided on the security measures showed that the knowledge of the respondents about the 
threats to the state cyberspace influences the decision on the choice of security and data protection methods. This relationship was 
investigated using the r-Pearson correlation coefficient (Table 14), and it is depicted in a scatter diagram (Fig. 5). 
The r-Pearson correlation coefficient’s value showed a strong statistical relationship between the studied variables. In the case of 
the studied variables, there is a positive correlation, i.e. an increase in knowledge about threats to the cyberspace of the state affects the 
increase in the data protection security measures and methods used. 
The empirical research also included the respondents’ attitudes towards good practices or risky behaviour in cyberspace. This is 
because ensuring data protection is determined mainly by compliance with cyberspace security rules. Moreover, user behaviour may 
generate vulnerabilities that expose data and services to the loss of information security attributes. In this context, the survey ques-
tionnaire formulated questions about the attitudes and behaviour of the respondents in the area of compliance with security rules and 
good practices, risky behaviour in cyberspace, as well as personal data protection and privacy. The survey results regarding the issues 
mentioned above are presented in Table 15. 
According to the above table, the questions in the questionnaire regarding the attitudes and behaviour of the respondents were 
formulated using the Likert scale. In the area of safety rules and best practices, the answer “sometimes” was dominant in the over-
whelming majority of cases. The figures lead to the conclusion that the majority of respondents do not follow the recommended so-
lutions that contribute to ensuring cyberspace security. After summing up the answers “always” and “often”, the attitudes and 
behaviour of the respondents for individual safety rules and good practices are as follows: software updating (including the operating 
system) - 44%, viruses’ database updating in an antivirus program - 42%, using websites that have the HTTPS protocol - 39%, regular 
password changing and applying passwords of adequate complexity - 27%, scanning external storage media - 25%, two-factor 
authentication - 19%, scanning e-mail attachments - 16%, regular scanning computer for malware - 16%. The largest number of re-
spondents “never” scan external storage media, do not use two-factor authentication and do not scan attachments in received e-mails. 
Another area presented in Table 15 is risky behaviour in cyberspace. Analysing the study results, most of the respondents confirmed 
the performance of activities in cyberspace that are potentially dangerous and may generate vulnerability. The sum of the answers 
“always”, “often” and “sometimes” for each of the examined elements was as follows: downloading illegal software - 84%, using 
potentially dangerous websites - 71%, using public Wi-Fi - 67%, opening attachments and links from an unknown source - 59%, 
viewing spam and other messages from an unknown source - 53%. It should be emphasised that the behaviours of the respondents, 
which may be considered risky in cyberspace, do not occur regularly because the most common answer was “sometimes”. Never -
theless, it can be assumed that respondents’ awareness is insufficient in terms of the risk resulting from the analysed behaviour in 
cyberspace. 
The last group listed in Table 15 is personal data protection and maintaining privacy in cyberspace. It should be emphasised that 
marginalising the discussed issues is facilitating the occurrence of various types of threats that may relate to the personal safety of users 
(e.g., Newman, 2006). The cited data shows that 50% of respondents “always” or “often” adjust the default privacy settings on social 
networks to their own needs. About 41% of respondents “always” or “often” consent to data profiling, with the most frequently chosen

12answer being “sometimes ”. The exclusion of geolocation services in an operating system is as follows: “always ” - 12%, “often ” - 17%, 
“sometimes ” - 38%, “rarely ” - 26%, “never ” - 7%. The analysis of the collected material shows that only 36% of the respondents 
“always ” or “often ” read privacy policies and terms of use of websites. The largest number of respondents indicated that they do not or 
rarely use browsers that do not record their search history. 27% of respondents admitted that “always ” or “often ” consent to allowing 
third parties to access and use their data. Network traffic anonymisation is the solution used by the smallest number of respondents. 
The percentage distribution in this range is as follows: “always ” - 4%, “often ” - 10%, “sometimes ” - 22%, “rarely ” - 24%, “never ” - 40%. 
Summarising the above considerations, it can be stated that the attitudes and behaviour of the respondents in the area of cyber -
security are insufficient. Compliance with the rules and good practices functions to a limited extent. Most of the respondents perform 
activities that may be considered dangerous and risky with varying frequency. The protection of personal data and the preservation of 
privacy in cyberspace occurs at a slightly better level than other areas of the study. It can be assumed that this is a consequence of 
implementing the provisions of the GDPR in the EU member states. 
The analysis of the respondents ’ answers made it possible to adopt the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the attitudes 
and behaviour of respondents in cyberspace and participation in training or courses in the field of information security. This rela-
tionship was tested using the Chi-2 test and the Persona C correlation coefficient (Table 16). 
The results of the Chi-2 test and the values of the C Pearson ’s coefficient allowed for positive verification of the hypothesis about the 
existence of a relationship between the attitudes and behaviour of respondents and participation in training or courses. Compliance 
with the principles of security and good practices in cyberspace occurred in an overwhelming number of cases regarding people who 
acquired appropriate knowledge in this area. The research results show a moderate correlation between the risky behaviour of users in 
cyberspace and participation in training or courses. Despite their knowledge of the threats, respondents relatively often download Table 13

13illegal software, use potentially dangerous websites or use public Wi-Fi. Nevertheless, many other publications also emphasise that the 
elements mentioned above constitute a significant problem in cybersecurity (e.g., Jaishankar, 2011). The attitudes and behaviour of 
respondents facilitating data protection and maintaining privacy in cyberspace are determined by the knowledge that the respondents 
acquired during training or courses. As already mentioned, it can be assumed that the results of research in this area could also be 
influenced by the implementation of the GDPR provisions into the legal order of European Union member states. 
The above considerations lead to the conclusion that raising knowledge in the area of cyberspace, including shaping the right 
attitudes and behaviour, can be achieved through education for cybersecurity. Table 15

144.3. Improving competencies in the field of cybersecurity 
In 2020, ENISA published a report on cybersecurity skills development. The report focuses on the education system and the 
problems related to the shortage of cybersecurity specialists and inadequate professional skills to meet modern labour market re-
quirements (ENISA, 2020b ). In this context, the improvement of competencies is an essential issue regarding ensuring cybersecurity. 
The survey questionnaire included questions about education, courses and training, the content of education, the form of education 
and sources of information on cybersecurity. Table 17 presents the study results on the respondents ’ opinions on the validity of shaping 
competencies at various levels of education, workplace, and public space. 
Based on the above data, it can be concluded that the majority of respondents see the need to improve competencies in the area of 
cybersecurity at all levels and types of education studied. The largest number of respondents assessed that it is necessary to conduct 
training at a workplace (73%) and to conduct public information campaigns (66%), which will contribute to the improvement of 
competencies in the field of cybersecurity. The percentage distribution for the remaining levels and types of education according to the 
affirmative responses of the respondents was as follows: university education - 63%, education in secondary schools - 61%, education 
in primary schools - 59%, additional courses and training - 52%. 
The questionnaire also formulated questions related to the content of education in which the respondents perceive the need to 
improve competencies. The questions included, among others, knowledge and skills in the context of formal and legal aspects of 
cybersecurity, principles of safe use of cyberspace, threats and methods of protection against threats, as well as personal data pro-
tection and maintaining privacy. The research results on the issues mentioned above are presented in Table 18. 
The figures in Table 18 show that most respondents see the need to raise knowledge and skills of the areas mentioned above. The 
sum of the answers “definitely yes” and “rather yes” for individual educational content was formed in the following order: rules of safe 
use of e-services - 96%, characteristics and use of security measures - 95%, procedures in the event of a security incident - 87%, 
characteristics, effects and detection of cyber threats - 86%, rights and obligations of cyberspace users - 85%, legal basis for cyber -
security - 83%, personal data protection and maintaining privacy - 78%. It is worth noting that the respondents are aware of the need 
for education in the field of cybersecurity and positively assess the proposed educational content. 
The last area studied within the scope of improvement and competencies was the preferred form of education and obtaining in-
formation on cybersecurity. Data on these issues are presented in Table 19. 
The table above presents the results of a study in the field of courses, training, and sources of information on cybersecurity. The 
study ’s goal in this area was to identify the forms by which it is possible to achieve effectiveness in raising competencies and 
awareness. Most respondents prefer to participate in stationary training in a traditional form (63%) and raise knowledge during in-
formation campaigns in the public media (53%). The respondents showed less interest in education and obtaining information using 
modern technologies. The percentage distribution in this respect is as follows: e-learning courses and training - 51%, mixed courses and 
training - 48%, information campaigns on social networks - 43%. The smallest number of respondents declared press articles (41%) 
and information brochures and newsletters (28%) as the preferred source of obtaining information on cybersecurity. It is worth 
emphasising that the forms of education and sources of information selected by the respondents are significantly differentiated in terms 
of age structure (Table 20). 
Table 20 show that younger people prefer forms of communication based on new technologies, such as e-learning and social 
networks. On the other hand, older people declared traditional forms of education and information sources, i.e. stationary courses and 
training, information campaigns in public media. Therefore, it can be assumed that there is a correlation between the answers given by 
the respondents and their age. The adopted hypothesis was verified using the Chi-2 independence test and the Pearson C coefficient 
(Table 21). 
The above data lead to a positive verification of the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the preferred forms of education 
and sources of information about cybersecurity and the age of the respondents. The value of the C Pearson ’s coefficient indicates a 
strong correlation between the studied variables in the scope of e-learning courses and training and information campaigns on social 
networks. A moderate dependence occurred in traditional courses and training, information campaigns in public media, articles in the 
press, and information brochures and newsletters. The study of the relationship between the age of the respondents and the courses and 
training carried out in a mixed form indicates a weak relationship between the studied variables. Summing up, it can be assumed that 
the effectiveness in raising knowledge may be achieved in different channels and forms of communication according to potential 
recipients. 
5.Conclusions and recommendations 
The technological revolution and the emergence of the information society generate many possibilities and areas of functioning in 
cyberspace. The further evolution of cyberspace, on the one hand, creates further development possibilities, and on the other hand, 
there is a need to ensure the security of the carried-out processes. One of the conditions for the effective functioning of society in 
cyberspace is having appropriate knowledge and skills in the discussed field. With regard to the subject and objectives of the research 
and research problems, the following conclusions were formulated:  
 A review of the literature on the subject indicated that many of the analysed definitions of cybersecurity take into account the 
cyberspace user. The key issue in this respect is to raise the level of skills and knowledge to build society ’s resilience to threats in 
cyberspace. Furthermore, for many countries and international organisations, the discussed issue is one of the priorities in 
cybersecurity. E.K. Szczepaniuk and H. Szczepaniuk                                                                                                                                                                             Telecommunications Policy 46 (2022) 102282
15 Cyberspace security in the context of the human factor can be analysed by applying a layered structure. The article proposes to 
distinguish a strategic layer, a technical layer and a social layer. The areas mentioned above are interrelated and may affect the 
effectiveness of cybersecurity management. The proposed interpretation of cyberspace security may contribute to the study of 
relationships between individual layers and the identification of problem areas. In this context, the article details the social 
dimension of cybersecurity with the following types of requirements: legal, organisational, procedural, educational and technical. Table 18

Policy recommendations - cybersecurity competencies.  
Field Recommendations 
The essence and definition of cybersecurity  - In defining cybersecurity, it is justified to consider the human factor. The social dimension of 
cybersecurity should take into account the following requirements:  
o Policies, strategic documents and legal acts define the areas of education and training that will 
include cybersecurity competencies.  
o Legal acts provide legal protection of cyberspace users.  
o The organisation of the cybersecurity system ensures the attributes of information security and 
minimises the risk of threats caused by the vulnerability of the human factor.  
o Cyberspace users have and improve their competencies in the field of cybersecurity. 
Research on cybersecurity competencies  - One of the measures for assessing the effectiveness of the implementation of the sustainable 
development goals may be the empirical research results on cybersecurity competencies.  
- Research should take into account knowledge, skills and attitudes in the field of cybersecurity.  
- Competency analysis should take into account user interactions with individual layers of 
cyberspace security (Fig. 1).  
- The Cybersecurity Competency Model can be the basis for assessing competencies in the field of 
cybersecurity (Fig. 2).  
- It is legitimate for research to include the analysis of statistical relationships between dependent 
and independent variables. Recognition of the relationship between the studied variables will 
enable the development of educational programs that will be dedicated to specific groups of 
recipients. 
Threats to cyberspace of the state and 
methods of cyber attacks  - Research results have shown that there is a need to increase knowledge about the threats and 
methods of cyberattacks.  
- Courses and training have a significant impact on the level of knowledge about threats. It is 
important to disseminate general and specialist knowledge about the threats and methods of 
cyberattacks.  
- The analysis of statistical dependencies showed that there is a relationship between the knowledge 
of cyberspace threats and the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. The content of 
information campaigns and training courses should be developed taking into account the charac -
teristics of the recipients, i.e. age, education. 
Security and data protection in cyberspace  - It is necessary to promote knowledge and skills about specialised solutions that minimise the risk of 
security incidents.  
- The findings of empirical research have shown that awareness of threats influences the choice of 
security measures and methods of data protection. There is a strong correlation between the use of 
specialised security measures and knowledge about the threats to the state cyberspace. Educational 
programs should include knowledge of identifying threats in cyberspace and the types of adequate 
protection methods.  
- It is reasonable to promote principles and good practices, such as two-factor authentication, 
scanning (computers, storage media, e-mail attachments), updating (software, virus databases in 
an antivirus program).  
- Training programs should present the potential effects of risky activities in cyberspace, such as, e.g. 
downloading illegal software, opening attachments and links from an unknown source, using 
public Wi-Fi and using potentially dangerous sites.  
- The protection of personal data and the preservation of privacy in cyberspace is on a better level 
compared to other areas of the study. Nevertheless, it is justified to improve competencies in the 
discussed area.  
- The analysis of statistical dependencies showed that there is a relationship between attitudes and 
behaviour in cyberspace and participation in training and courses. Therefore, it can be assumed 
that increasing the frequency of training and disseminating knowledge may contribute to 
increasing competencies in the field of security and data protection in cyberspace. 
Improving cybersecurity competencies  - Most of the respondents see the need to improve their cybersecurity competencies. There is great 
interest in on-the-job training and public information campaigns. Appropriate information cam-
paigns and training can be positively accepted by the public. In addition, it is reasonable to include 
cybersecurity issues at all levels of education (primary schools, secondary schools, university 
education).  
- The recommended content of education in the field of cybersecurity includes, among others: legal 
bases, rights and obligations of users, rules of safe use of e-services, conduct in the event of a 
security incident, detection of cyber threats, use of security, data and personal protection and 
preservation of privacy.  
- The choice of the preferred forms and sources of information depends on the age structure. 
Research findings have shown that younger people prefer new technologies, while older people 
prefer traditional forms of training. Therefore, it is reasonable to implement training courses taking 
into account various forms and sources of information, e.g. e-learning, social media, public media, 
press articles. E.K. Szczepaniuk and H. Szczepaniuk                                                                                                                                                                             Telecommunications Policy 46 (2022) 102282
17 The theoretical analysis indicates that competencies in the context of the research subject are often equated with the proper 
perception of threats in cyberspace, having adequate knowledge, skills and attitudes to facilitate ensuring cybersecurity. The 
Cybersecurity Competency Model developed by NICE can provide a reference point for analysing and assessing the human factor in 
cybersecurity. It is worth emphasising that the lack of knowledge and competencies may generate vulnerabilities in a security 
system.  
 Achieving sustainable development goals requires the implementation of many projects, including increasing cybersecurity 
competencies. Many strategic documents indicate that the challenges for cybersecurity policy include the need to improve the 
human factor. An essential task for politics is promoting cyber hygiene, digital skills, providing information on threats and pro-
tection methods. The European Union regulations improved the level of security of networks and information systems. Never -
theless, there are still problem areas in the field of cybersecurity. In addition, it can be assumed that the further development of 
digitisation will increase the demand for competencies in the field of cybersecurity. Therefore, it is justified to improve the existing 
solutions to minimise the risk of threats caused by the vulnerability of the human factor.  
 The paper presents the research results on competencies in the field of threats to the state cyberspace, methods of cyberattacks, and 
data security measures and protection. The survey questionnaire also contained questions aimed at finding out the respondents ’ 
opinions within the range of educational content and the need to improve competencies. The empirical research aimed to identify 
forms of education and communication sources that can be used to achieve efficiency in raising cybersecurity competencies.  
 The research results showed that the respondents ’ awareness and knowledge of threats to the state cyberspace are insufficient. Most 
of the respondents are not aware of the specificity and scale of such threats as intentional and unintentional activities of the or-
ganisation ’s employees, social engineering, cyber warfare and cyber spying. The analysis of the socio-demographic characteristics 
of the respondents and the answers provided indicated the existence of a relationship between knowledge, education, and age. 
People with higher education and younger people are more aware of the threats to the state cyberspace. In this context, the authors 
recommend the implementation of information campaigns and training courses that take into account the education and age 
structures.  
 The quantitative data on cyberattacks and malware highlighted significant gaps in specialised knowledge. The research results 
showed a significant statistical relationship between the answers provided and the type of education and training in information 
security. The respondents with IT education and the people participating in the training were distinguished by much greater 
knowledge within the range of the discussed field. Therefore, it is justified to consider the need to introduce a subject considering 
principles of safe use of cyberspace to the education programs of all fields of study. However, in the field of training, the gradual 
introduction of courses for public and private sector employees is recommended.  
 Based on the results of research on security and data protection methods, it can be stated that the majority of respondents use 
popular solutions such as antiviruses or firewall software. Other of the tested methods of protection occurs to a rather limited 
extent. The statistical dependencies analysis showed a positive correlation between knowledge of threats and the applied security 
measures and data protection methods. People who are more aware of the threats to the cyberspace of the state usually use many 
types of security simultaneously. Therefore, it can be assumed that improving the knowledge about the scale and effects of cyber 
threats could contribute to increasing the prevention of cyberattacks among society. Therefore, it is reasonable to include the 
discussed content both in education programs and courses, as well as in public media.  
 The empirical research also covered the attitudes and behaviours of users in cyberspace, which concerned compliance with security 
principles and good practices, risky behaviour, as well as personal data protection and maintaining privacy. Detailed analysis of the 
issue proves that most respondents do not comply with the recommended cyberspace security rules and perform activities that may 
be considered dangerous. Examples include no regular computer scanning for malware, no scanning of external storage media, 
downloading illegal software, using public Wi-Fi networks or viewing messages from an unknown source. On the other hand, the 
protection of personal data and the maintenance of privacy are of a higher level. Nevertheless, it can be stated that too high a 
percentage of respondents, for example, do not read privacy policies and terms of use of websites. The study of statistical re-
lationships showed a relationship between training and the attitudes and behaviour of the respondents in cyberspace. The research 
results in this area once again confirm the positive impact of education on raising competencies in the area of cybersecurity. 
Therefore, it is recommended to increase the number of training courses regarding the research issues.  
 The questionnaire also included questions regarding the respondents ’ opinions on education, training, education content and 
preferred forms of obtaining sources of information on cybersecurity. This part of the research aimed to identify social needs in the 
discussed area and to identify forms of communication with the help of which it is possible to achieve greater efficiency in raising 
competencies. It should be emphasised that the majority of respondents are aware of the need to popularise knowledge and 
improve competencies in the studied areas. Therefore, it can be assumed that relevant information campaigns could be positively 
received by the public. Comparing the research results to the preferred forms and sources of information on cybersecurity, it can be 
noticed that the selection of specific types is determined by the age structure. The statistical dependencies analysis showed that 
younger people prefer methods that use new technologies, e.g., e-learning, social media. On the other hand, the older adults declare 
their readiness to raise knowledge using traditional forms of communication, e.g., stationary courses and training, information 
campaigns in public media. In this context, the authors recommend using the potential of the available forms of education and 
information sources to improve cybersecurity competencies. It can be assumed that the differentiation of the forms of communi -
cation according to the age structure could contribute to the expanse of the range of potential recipients. Source: Own work. E.K. Szczepaniuk and H. Szczepaniuk                                                                                                                                                                             Telecommunications Policy 46 (2022) 102282
18The research results made it possible to define the recommended solutions for the policy for the purpose of improving cybersecurity 
competencies (Table 22). 
The article ’s subject concerned the important issue of improving the human factor in cybersecurity. It should be emphasised that 
the lack of appropriate competencies in the discussed area may lead to negative consequences for both personal safety and may bring 
about significant losses to public and private institutions and national security. Moreover, the modern labour market requirement is 
the demand for cybersecurity specialists. 
The implementation of the recommended solutions for the policy requires increasing financial outlays on cybersecurity. In orga-
nisations, it is justified to increase expenditure on educating employees and increasing their competencies in the field of cybersecurity. 
As previously mentioned, many reports show that cybercrime losses are enormous and tend to increase. Compliance with cyber hy-
giene principles can reduce the significant number of security incidents caused by human factor vulnerabilities. Education expenditure 
can be a significant economic burden for many organisations. However, the costs of handling security incidents are often much higher. 
Especially that there is still an unsolved problem area of insufficient competencies in the field of cybersecurity. The overall economic 
profit and loss account of investments in cybersecurity education requires further analysis. 
In addition, it is also worth considering the risks associated with the vulnerability of the human factor to fake software updates. 
There are many attack vectors that take advantage of fake updates. Cybercriminals can use social engineering techniques and send fake 
messages about updates. Directional attacks on update servers are also possible, causing end devices to receive updates containing 
malware. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that raising cybersecurity competencies is a significant strategic challenge. In conclusion, the au-
thors perceive a need to continue research regarding competencies in the area of cybersecurity.
