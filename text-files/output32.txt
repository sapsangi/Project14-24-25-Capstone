vEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This Report of the Submarine Cable Resiliency Working Group of CSRIC V (“WG4A”)
examines the key regulatory agencies and activities that impact submarine cables, along
with interagency coordination mechanisms and problems. It recommends the adoption of
additional policies, best practices and protection measures to mitigate the problems.
Recent conflicts between cables and other marine activities (including offshore dredging,
beach replenishments, and offshore wind farms and hydrokinetic energy projects)
highlight the urgent need for establishment of a single federal point of contact and
clearing house for submarine cables, timely exchange of information by and greater
coordination between the agencies that authorize such projects, proactive involvement by
the FCC in marine spatial planning, and development of additional standards and policies
to ensure the resilience of submarine cables infrastructure and continuity of
communications.
BACKGROUND ON CSRIC V AND WORKING GROUP 4A
Objectives and Methods
The Federal Communication Commission (“FCC” or “Commission”) tasked the
Submarine Cable Routing and Landing Working Group of CSRIC IV (“WG8”) with the
responsibility of examining the risks posed to submarine cable infrastructure and how
proximity to other marine activities, governmental permitting processes, and clustering of
cable routes and landings can increase the risk of cable damage. This, in turn, has the
potential to affect U.S. network reliability. WG4A continues the work begun during
CSRIC IV.
The focus of the working group includes addressing not only spatial separation of cable
lines, but also governmental coordination issues. This report examines interagency and
interjurisdictional coordination issues. More specifically, this report identifies: (1) key
federal regulatory activities and their lead agencies; (2) key state and local regulatory
activities; (3) existing coordination problems; and (4) existing interagency and
interjurisdictional coordination mechanisms. The report examines gaps, conflicts, and
sources of delay in existing federal, state, and local interagency coordination for offshore
permitting, as well as recommends mechanisms for enhancing coordination without
increasing regulatory burdens.
Membership
WG4A consists of approximately 22 members. They represent diverse interests
including submarine cable operators, cable system customers, marine services
consultants, federal energy agencies, and state regulators, all with subject matter expertise
to accomplish WG4A’s objectives.WG4A MEMBERS AND PARTICIPANTS

2BACKGROUND
Extent of Federal and State/Local Jurisdiction
Multilateral treaties, customary international law, federal statutes, and Executive Orders
define the limits of U.S. jurisdiction over ocean areas adjacent to the U.S. coast. As
described in CSRIC IV’s report on the use of spatial separation to protect submarine
cable infrastructure,1 various international treaties dating back to 1884 guarantee unique
freedoms to lay, maintain, and repair submarine cables—freedoms not granted for any
other marine activities—and restrict the ability of coastal states (i.e., countries) to
regulate them.2 Specifically, these treaties guarantee:
 The freedom to install submarine cables on the high seas beyond the continental
shelf and to repair existing cables without impediment or prejudice;3
 The freedom to install and maintain submarine cables on the continental shelf,
which extends 200 nautical miles seaward from the shore of a coastal state,
subject to further extension upon recognition of a claim of an extended
continental shelf,4 subject to reasonable measures for the exploration of the
continental shelf and the exploitation of its natural resources;5
 The freedom to install and maintain submarine cables in the exclusive economic
zone (“EEZ”) of all states, which such states may assert up to 200 nautical miles
seaward from their shores;6

Convention.”).

the continental shelf is subject to coastal-state consent, while the course of a submarine cable is not.

3 The ability to install submarine cables in a state’s territory or territorial sea, which
a state may assert up to 12 nautical miles seaward from its shore subject to
conditions and exercise of national jurisdiction;7 and
 The freedom to maintain existing submarine cables passing through the waters of
an archipelagic state without making landfall.8
These treaty obligations are now treated as customary international law,9 in particular by
the United States.10
Although these treaties permit coastal states to take reasonable measures respecting
natural resource exploitation on the continental shelf, they bar states from taking such
measures with respect to submarine cables, the construction and repair of which are not
undertaken for natural resource exploration or exploitation.11
In contrast with freedoms granted to submarine cable operators in the EEZ and on the
continental shelf, these treaties grant coastal states jurisdiction to control and regulate a
variety of activities, including commercial fishing, oil and gas exploration, marine
minerals development, and renewable energy infrastructure development.
In the United States, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”) explicitly
extended federal jurisdiction and of certain enumerated laws to the outer Continental
Shelf (“OCS”) with respect to regulation of a specific class of activities:

ratified the LOS Convention (it signed only in 1994) and even though the Convention did not enter
into force for those states that had ratified it until 1994. Presidential proclamations by two different
U.S. presidents expressly stated that the establishments of an EEZ and a contiguous zone, respectively,
did not infringe on the high-seas freedoms to lay and repair submarine cables. See Presidential Proc.

Aug. 15, 2014) (stating that “beyond the outer limits of the 12 nm territorial sea, the coastal State may
not (and should not) impede the laying or maintenance of cables, even though the delineation of the
course for the laying of such pipelines [but not submarine cables] on the continental shelf is subject to
its consent. The coastal State has jurisdiction only over cables constructed or used in connection with
the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial
islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction.”)..
4The Constitution and laws and civil and political jurisdiction of the
United States are extended to the subsoil and seabed of the outer
Continental Shelf and to all artificial islands, and all installations
and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the
seabed, which may be erected thereon for the purpose of exploring
for, developing, or producing resources therefrom, or any such
installation or other device (other than a ship or vessel) for the
purpose of transporting such resources, to the same extent as if the
outer Continental Shelf were an area of exclusive Federal
jurisdiction located within a State.12
OCSLA grants the U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”) the authority to regulate the marking of
artificial islands, installations, and other devices enumerated in 43 U.S.C. § 1333(a)(1)
for purposes of promoting safety of life and property. OCSLA also grants the Secretary
of the Army authority to regulate artificial islands, installations, and other devices
enumerated in 43 U.S.C. § 1333(a)(1) for purposes of preventing obstruction to
navigation in the navigable waters of the United States.
In the 1940s, several U.S. states claimed jurisdiction over mineral and other resources off
their coasts. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected these claims in 1947 when it determined
that states had no title to, or property interest in, these resources. In response, the U.S.
Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act in 1953 to give each coastal state jurisdiction
over a territorial sea extending three nautical miles seaward from the coastal baseline.13
For historical reasons, the state territorial seas of Texas and the Gulf Coast of Florida
extend nine nautical miles seaward from the coastal baseline. Subsequent legislation
granted the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa jurisdiction three nautical
miles seaward from the coastal baseline, while Puerto Rico has jurisdiction nine nautical
miles from the coastal baseline.
The federal government retains the power to regulate commerce, navigation, power
generation, national defense, and international affairs throughout state waters.
Nevertheless, U.S. states and territories retain authority within their territorial seas to
manage, develop, and lease resources throughout the water column and on and under the
seafloor. States have similar authorities on the land side of the baseline, usually up to the
mean high tide line, an area known as state tidelands.
In certain instances, a state’s regulatory role stems from a federal law where authority to
administer compliance with the act’s requirements is delegated to the state.14 The array

delegate to a state the responsibility to regulate activities within the state’s designated coastal zone.
5of federal and state regulations and tribal requirements can create a complex set of
processes and requirements for pursuing or tracking a project proposal. Although an
individual state’s regulatory process may be less complex than the federal bureaucracy,
the variation in how states regulate the aforementioned activities leads to complexity on
an interstate, regional, and national level.15
Regulatory Fundamentals
Agency roles in offshore waters vary greatly based on statutory and pragmatic factors.
For instance, one agency may authorize an infrastructure project, another may construct
an infrastructure project, and others may be charged with protecting specific resources
within the area where an infrastructure project is sited. In cases where a federal agency is
acting on its statutory authority to carry out a project, the federal agency is the action
agency (e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“ACOE” or “Corps”) is the action
agency for federal dredging projects). In cases where a federal agency has the statutory
role of approving all or part of a project, the federal agency is the authorizing agency
(e.g., the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) is the authorizing agency when species
or critical habitat protected under the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), and that fall
under FWS’s jurisdiction, could be affected by a proposed project). In general, if a
federal action or authorization for a project is under review, even a small part of a larger
project, the entire project is subject to the requirements of all applicable federal laws and
statutes. As a result, in most proceedings that have a ‘federal nexus,’ there are multiple
federal authorizing agencies, each with different mandates and responsibilities, and
operating under different statutes.
As a practical matter in dealing with the multiple statutes, sets of regulations, and
agencies, an important role is that of the ‘lead agency.’ The key roles of a lead agency
are to: (1) provide a process that complies the with letter and spirit of the administrative
requirements of the relevant statutes; (2) establish a common process schedule; (3)
maintain a record (generally a public record) of the proceeding; (4) support the making of
the necessary decisions; and (5) communicate the decisions to those who must act on
them. As an example, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is the lead
agency for the siting of marine and hydrokinetic (“MHK”) energy projects in state
waters. In terms of authority, however, the lead agency may or may not make the final
decision on authorizing or denying a project proposal and rarely has authority over all of
the conditions (and smaller decisions) that might be applied as part of a project approval.
Though the lead agency is usually essential, other federal agencies, and state agencies
Also, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency can delegate to the state the responsibility for
administering compliance with sections of the Clean Water Act.
15 This paragraph is partially paraphrased from An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century. See fn. 1,
supra.
6and tribal organizations applying federal authority, often have the authority to stop or
significantly modify a project.
While the discussion above is focused on individual projects, the potential effects of
multiple proposed projects in a given area over time may need to be assessed. Some
statutes require that the review of a specific project include evaluation of cumulative
effects to existing resources and uses. For example, the National Environmental Policy
Act (“NEPA”) requires the federal action agency to consider cumulative effects as part of
its environmental review of a proposed project.16
In addition to their site-specific and cumulative-impact assessments, agencies also engage
in policy planning and rulemaking activities that establish ground rules for the conduct of
particular categories of marine and coastal activities and encourage or discourage
particular kinds of activities. Several statutes require the preparation of large-scale,
multi-year plans by federal agencies. In some cases, a federal agency is authorized to
lead or participate in large-scale planning processes with other federal agencies, tribes,
state agencies, and other stakeholders. Plans developed from such a framework are
generally intended to inform local or regional scale decisions. Site-specific
authorizations, however, usually require the collection and analysis of information
gathered for a specific area of interest, generally more than can realistically be gathered
for a large-scale planning document. Often, site-specific information is needed for an
authorization, even when some information for the site exists in a large-scale plan.
Process Requirements
The regulatory framework for evaluating a proposed project is complex and governed by
multiple federal laws and statutes. Although individual federal agencies typically act
pursuant to their “organic” statutes (i.e., the laws authorizing them to undertake licensing,
permitting, and other regulatory activities in specific substantive areas), certain federal
laws and regulations dictate some of their procedures and the means by which they must
interact with each other.
Under the NEPA, federal agencies must establish procedures to identify and account for
the environmental impact of projects they undertake or authorize.17 To that end, NEPA
established the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”), tasking it to oversee the
16 According to the Council on Environmental Quality’s regulations for implementing NEPA (50 C.F.R.
§ 1508.7), an action may cause cumulative impacts on the environment if its impacts overlap in space
or time with the impacts of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of
what agency or person undertakes such other actions.
17 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321-4370e.
7programs and activities of the federal government in order to determine whether those
programs and activities are contributing to the achievement of U.S. environmental
policy.18 The CEQ has established a three-tiered approach to NEPA implementation and
compliance which applies to all federal agencies, including the Commission. First, for
“major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,”
NEPA requires agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement (“EIS”).19
Second, for major actions that may significantly affect the quality of the human
environment, the CEQ permits federal agencies to prepare an environmental assessment
(“EA”) to determine whether an EIS is necessary.20 Third, for activities that individually
and cumulatively do not significantly affect the quality of the human environment and for
which environmental analysis would be required only in extraordinary circumstances, the
CEQ allows federal agencies to exclude categorically those activities from evaluation
under NEPA.21 The EA and categorical exclusion provisions of the CEQ’s regulations
make plain that not every action of a federal agency is a “major” action with
“significant”—or even certain—environmental effects. To ensure proper agency
coordination, the CEQ’s NEPA regulations call for the selection of a “lead agency” to
take primary responsibility for preparing the EIS or EA.22 NEPA directs the responsible
federal official (i.e., the lead agency) to “consult and obtain the comments of any Federal
agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any
environmental impact involved.”23
As for matters of historic preservation, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (“NHPA”) requires federal agencies to consider the effects of their actions upon
properties included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic
Places.24 To that end, NHPA established the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
(“ACHP”) to implement the NHPA. Both the NHPA and the ACHP’s regulations require
that, for actions affecting historic properties, federal agencies initiate a consultation
process with the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer, affected Indian Tribes,
and the ACHP.25

8The Administrative Procedure Act establishes standards governing the internal processes
of federal administrative agencies and their interactions with members of the public,
including rulemaking, adjudication, and licensing.26 It requires agencies to: (1) inform
the public of their organization, procedures and rules; (2) provide for public participation
in the rulemaking process; (3) establish uniform standards for rulemakings and
adjudications, including on-the-record proceedings with an opportunity to be heard; and
(4) restate the law for seeking judicial review of agency actions.
Most states and territories have similar state-level laws governing environmental impact
and the administrative process.
Additionally, there are a number of other organic federal laws and statutes that a federal
action agency must consider and comply with in its review of a proposed project. These
include the Marine Mammal Protection Act (“MMPA”), the ESA, section 305(b)(2) of
the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (“MSA”) (Essential
Fish Habitat), the Coastal Zone Management Act (“CZMA”), the Clean Water Act, the
Federal Power Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Communications Act of
1934, and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Complying with the requirements of
these federal laws and statutes creates a complex and intricate regulatory process that can
create interagency and interjurisdictional challenges when reviewing and authorizing a
proposed project.
Key Federal Regulatory Activities and Their Lead Agencies
Cable Landing Licenses for Submarine Cables
Cable Landing License. Before constructing or operating a submarine cable within U.S.
territory (including the U.S. territorial sea, which extends 12 nautical miles seaward from
the shore), an operator must obtain a cable landing license issued by the FCC pursuant to
the Cable Landing License Act of 1921.27 The Cable Landing License Act does not apply
to “cables, all of which, including both terminals, lie wholly within the continental United
States.”28 Consequently, a number of coastal and intrastate submarine cable systems have
26 5 U.S.C. §§ 551-559.
27 “An act relating to the Landing and Operation of Submarine Cables in the United States,” codified at
47 U.S.C. §§ 34-39 (“Cable Landing License Act”); 47 C.F.R. § 1.767.
28 Id. Although the term “continental United States” appears frequently in federal statutes, it does not
have a consistent meaning throughout. In some statutes, the term refers to the lower 48 states plus
Alaska (see, e.g., 1 U.S.C. § 1 note) or to all 50 states (see, e.g., 12 U.S.C. § 221). In other cases, the
term refers only to the lower 48 states (see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 5701(6); 26 U.S.C. § 4262(c)(1)). When
the U.S. Congress admitted Hawaii and Alaska as states, amending numerous provisions of the U.S.
Code to specify whether “continental United States” included Hawaii or should be replaced by a
reference to “the States,” it neglected to clarify the applicability or non-applicability of the Cable
9not been licensed by the FCC pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act. The FCC
issues a single cable landing license for all landings in the United States and its
territories. Although construction is undertaken by a supplier, it is the cable owner that
must apply for and hold the cable landing license, even during the construction phase.
The FCC requires license applications for: (1) every entity directly owning five percent
or more of the cable system assets (but not each entity that owns five percent or more of
the corporate entity owning the cable system) which also intends to use the U.S.
endpoint(s) of the cable system, and, absent a waiver, (2) every entity owning or
controlling a U.S. cable station where the cable system lands.29 A cable landing license is
both an infrastructure and a services license that authorizes the construction, ownership,
and operation of a submarine cable system landing in the United States. If a submarine
cable operator provides—or is required by the FCC to provide—“common-carrier”
services, it must obtain a separate carrier license (in addition to the cable landing license)
under Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.30
Executive Branch Review. The Cable Landing License Act authorizes the President—
not the FCC—to grant cable landing licenses. Under a 1954 Executive Order, President
Eisenhower delegated to the FCC the ministerial task of granting cable landing licenses
subject to final review and approval by the U.S. Department of State, in consultation with
the U.S. Departments of Defense and Commerce.31 Such Executive Branch review and
approval is now routine. This Executive Branch review is entirely separate from Team
Telecom national security reviews, discussed below.
Categorical Exclusion from Environmental Processing. Under NEPA, the FCC
decided in 1974 that an application for a submarine cable landing license would be
categorically excluded from scrutiny under the FCC’s environmental processing, based
on a finding that submarine cable installation was unlikely to have a significant
Landing License Act. See Hawaii Omnibus Act, Pub. L. 86-624, July 12, 1960, 74 Stat. 411 (48
U.S.C. note prec. 491); Alaska Omnibus Act, Pub. L. 86-70, June 25, 1959, 73 Stat. 141. The FCC
International Bureau has long taken the position that a system requires a cable landing license if it
extends beyond the U.S. territorial sea. See FCC International Bureau, Submarine Cable Landing
Licenses (last visited Apr. 1, 2016) (stating that a cable landing license must be obtained for a system

Consistency with State and Territorial Coastal Zone Management Plans. Under the
complex system of U.S. coastal regulation, the CZMA grants state and territorial
governments the right to review permitting and licensing activities by federal government
agencies to ensure consistency with state and territorial coastal management plans, under
which the states and territories regulate activities within or affecting a state or territory’s
sea (which extends three nautical miles seaward from the shore).34 Most states and
territories maintain coastal zone management plans for which they may seek consistency
reviews of federal permitting activities. If a state or territory were to require a
consistency review of an FCC cable landing license application, that state or territory
could delay FCC licensing until completion of the consistency review.35 To date, no state
or territory has ever requested such a consistency review of an FCC cable landing license
application. Instead, the states and territories seek consistency reviews of submarine
telecommunications cable projects only with respect to permits issued by the Corps under
the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and the Clean Water Act.36
Team Telecom Scrutinizes Foreign Investment, Foreign Landings, and Financing and
Supplier Arrangements. The FCC under the authority delegated by Executive Order
refers cable landing license applications to the Executive Branch agencies for review of
any national security, law enforcement, and foreign policy and trade policy issues.37

over vast distances, the environmental consequences for the ocean, the ocean floor, and the land are
negligible. In shallow water, the cable is trenched and immediately covered; in deep water, it is simply

and a modest building housing facilities.”).

11Investigation)—conducts national security and law enforcement reviews of new facilities
or services and for FCC consent to transfer or assign a license in a merger or
acquisition. For a new submarine cable system, Team Telecom will generally conduct a
review if (1) the system will connect the United States to a foreign point, or (2) the
system will have aggregate direct or indirect foreign ownership of 10 percent or
more. Where particular ownership, supply, or financing arrangements raise concerns,
Team Telecom will typically make additional inquiries and information requests and will
often seek additional security-agreement conditions to safeguard U.S. surveillance
activities, U.S. communications generally, and infrastructure security.
Procedures. Team Telecom does not act pursuant to any law and has not promulgated
any regulations governing its substantive requirements and procedures. In spite of the
unwritten and non-public nature of its reviews, Team Telecom’s processes are reasonably
well-established. The filing of a cable landing license application with the FCC formally
triggers the Team Telecom process when it meets the foreign-ownership or foreign-
landing criteria described above. Team Telecom initiates its review by issuing a “triage”
questionnaire to the applicant. Team Telecom’s “triage” questionnaire requires
information duplicating parts of the FCC application as well as significant information
about each system’s principal equipment, U.S. landing arrangements, network operations
center operations, demarcation points, fiber map, cable station map, law enforcement
point of contact, direct and indirect ownership interests of five percent or more, and
management. Team Telecom typically requests that the FCC defer action on a license
application pending execution of a risk mitigation instrument, as described below. Once
a mitigation instrument (either a network security agreement or letter of assurances) is
executed, Team Telecom will petition the FCC to condition any license or transaction
approval on compliance with the mitigation instrument. The process is entirely
confidential, though any resulting security agreement or assurances letter is generally
made public via Team Telecom’s petition to the FCC to condition approval upon
compliance with the mitigation instrument. The FCC defers to the Executive Branch on
issues of national security, law enforcement, and public safety, and the FCC will not
grant a cable landing license absent Team Telecom clearance.38 The Team Telecom
process, rather than FCC scrutiny, is the principal source of delay in the grant of a cable
landing license.
Structures and Work in Waters of the U.S.
Permit Requirements in Waters of the United States, Including Navigable Waters. The
Corps regulates structures and work in navigable waters of the U.S. under Section 10 of
the Rivers and Harbors Act (Section 10) of 1899; discharges of dredged and fill material
in waters of the U.S. (including jurisdictional wetlands) under Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act (Section 404); and the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of
ocean disposal under Section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries
Act of 1972. The mission of the Corps’ Regulatory Program is to protect the nation’s
38 Foreign Participation Order, 12 FCC Rcd. at 23,919-20 ¶ 63.
12aquatic resources and navigation capacity, while allowing reasonable development
through fair and balanced decisions.
Navigable waters under Section 10 and Section 404 include, but are not limited to, tidal
waters and wetlands. Section 10 jurisdiction in tidal waters extends from the mean high
water line at shore to three nautical miles.39 The OCSLA of 1953 extended the Corps’
Section 10 authority from three nautical miles to the OCS for artificial islands,
installations, and devices located on the seafloor.40 As a general rule, the Corps does not
require the government of a foreign nation or a corporation incorporated in a foreign
nation and not incorporated in the U.S., to obtain a Section 10 permit for those portions
of a submarine communication cable laid on the seabed of the OCS seaward of twelve
nautical miles. Section 404 jurisdiction for tidal waters extends from the high tide line at
shore to three nautical miles.41
Examples of regulated work per Section 10 include obstructions or alterations of
navigable waters like construction or demolition in, over or under navigable waters,
excavation, dredging, or any other work that has the potential to affect the course,
location, condition or capacity of navigable waters, such as laying cables on or burying
cables under the seafloor. Examples of regulated work under Section 404 include fill
pads, trench and backfill, grading, rip-rap, mechanized land clearing, bank stabilization
and beach nourishment.
The Section 10/404 Permit Process. If the project would result in regulated activities as
described above, a permit from the Department of the Army is required prior to initiating
the work.42
Permit Application: The project proponent needs to submit an application to the
appropriate Corps District, describing the proposed work, location, purpose and need,
and to include drawings.43 After the application is received by the Corps, it is
assigned an identification number and reviewed for completeness. When
applications are incomplete, additional information will be requested of the applicant
in order to initiate the application process. The Corps determines what form of
permit is appropriate: individual, through a standard permit or letter of permission;
or general, through a regional general permit (“RGP”), programmatic general permit
(“PGP”) or nationwide permit (“NWP”).
39 See 33 C.F.R. § 329.
40 When the OCSLA was codified in 43 U.S.C. 1333(a), energy exploration, exploitation, or transport
was used as an example of a circumstance when a permit may be required. The First Circuit Court of
Appeals clarified in the decision Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound v. U.S. Department of the Army,
298 F.3d 105 (1st Cir. 2005) that this provision does not limit the authority of federal agencies to issue
permits only for energy exploration, exploitation, or transport. The submarine cable industry believes
that this ruling, as it might be applied to regulation of submarine cables on the OCS, is inconsistent
with U.S. treaty obligations.
41 See 33 C.F.R. § 328.
42 See id. § 325 (describing the permitting process).
43 See id. § 325.1(d) (listing permit application requirements).
13General Permits: The review processes for authorized general permits (RGPs, PGPs
or NWPs) vary. A case-by-case review of activities authorized by general permits is
not required when the project proponent complies with all the terms and conditions
of the general permit and any applicable regional conditions. There are cases when
general or regional permit conditions trigger reporting requirements when certain
thresholds are crossed, such as effects to endangered or threatened species, or historic
properties.
The case-by-case review by Corps Districts ensures the proposed activity results in
minimal adverse environmental effects and also meets the terms and conditions of
the general permit. Regional conditions can be added requiring reporting for a
district, state, county, watershed, or other geographic area. Also, special conditions
can be added to general permit authorizations to minimize adverse environmental
effects. Compensatory mitigation requirements may be imposed to offset the losses
of aquatic resources and time-of-year restrictions to protect species during critical
life cycle processes.
The district will notify the project proponent when the proposed activity will have
more than minimal individual or cumulative net adverse effects on the aquatic
environment or otherwise may be contrary to the public interest. The notification
can be either: (1) a NWP authorization with special conditions that are necessary to
ensure the adverse effects are minimal, or (2) instructions on how to apply for an
individual permit. Individual websites for Corps Districts list existing RGPs and
PGPs.
Examples of NWPs used in the past for submarine cables are NWP-3 and NWP-12.
NWP-3 authorizes the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of any previously or
currently authorized, structure, or fill, authorized by 33 C.F.R. § 330.3, provided the
structure or fill is not being used different from those uses specified or contemplated
in the original permit or the most recently authorized modification. This NWP also
authorizes the removal of accumulated sediments and debris in the vicinity of
existing structures (e.g., bridges, culverted road crossings, water intake structures,
etc.) and/or the placement of new or additional riprap to protect the structure. It also
authorizes temporary structures, fills, and work necessary to conduct the
maintenance activity. NWP-12 authorizes activities for construction, maintenance,
repair, and removal of utility lines and associated facilities in waters of the United
States. These activities must not result in the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of water
for each single and complete project. Once an application is submitted, the Corps
District will make a determination on which type and level of permit is appropriate
for the proposed activity.
A complete list of available NWPs is posted at
http://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/RegulatoryProgramandPermits/Na
tionwidePermits.aspx
14Individual Permit: Proposed work or activity not qualifying for the general permit
will require an Individual Permit. Once the Corps receives all information to
complete the application a public notice will be issued with a 30 day (normally)
comment period. This provides local, state and federal agencies, stakeholders and
the general public an opportunity to comment. The Corps reviews and considers all
comments received and any substantive comments will be furnished to the applicant
for their information and comment. The Corps may ask the applicant for additional
information, including information to make a public interest review determination,44
environmental data or information on other alternative sites.
The Corps evaluates the impacts of the project and all comments received, works with the
applicant to ensure necessary modifications of the project as required to avoid and
minimize effects, and completes appropriate documentation to support a recommended
permit decision. The permit decision document must include environmental
documentation required by the NEPA and findings of the public interest review process.
NEPA documentation, either an EA or EIS, provides for consideration of alternatives,
including the no action alternative, and discussion of effects of each alternative. For the
public interest review, all factors relevant to the proposal must be considered including
the cumulative effects: conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental
concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife, flood hazards, floodplain values,
land use, navigation, shore erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and
conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral
needs, consideration of property ownership, and needs and welfare of the people. The
specific weight of each factor is determined by its importance and relevance to the
particular proposal.
The following general criteria will also be considered: the relative extent of the public
and private need for the proposed structure or work; where there are unresolved conflicts
44 Until 1968, the primary focus of the Corps’ regulatory program was the protection of navigation.
Implementing subsequent laws and judicial decisions, the Corps’ program has evolved to one
involving the consideration of the full public interest by balancing the favorable impacts against the
detrimental impacts. This is known as the ‘‘public interest review.’’ Public Interest Review. (1) The
decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts, of the proposed activity and its intended use on the public interest. Evaluation of
the probable impact which the proposed activity may have on the public interest requires a careful
weighing of all those factors which become relevant in each particular case. The benefits which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. The decision whether to authorize a proposal, and if so, the conditions under
which it would be permitted, are therefore determined by the outcome of this general balancing
process. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal must be considered including the
cumulative effects thereof: among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards,
floodplain values, land use, navigation, shore erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and
conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs,
considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people. 33 C.F.R. §
320.4.
15as to resource use; the practicability of using reasonable alternatives and methods to
accomplish the objectives of the proposed structure or work; and the extent and
permanence of the beneficial and/or detrimental effects the proposed structure or work is
likely to have on the public and private uses.
A decision may not be made until consultations required under Section 7 of the ESA,
Section 106 of the NHPA are complete and the essential fish habitat (“EFH”) provisions
of the MSA have been met. The Corps makes every effort to adopt the lead federal
agency NEPA document, as well as Section 7, Section 106 and EFH. This works better
when the lead federal agency coordinates early in the process to incorporate information
that will be necessary to complete the Corps permit decision.
The Corps also considers Tribal resources affected by the project and complete
appropriate consultation with Tribes. Since there is no lead federal agency for tribal trust
responsibilities, each federal agency must consult with tribes on the impacts to tribal trust
resources within their jurisdiction. Work with the tribes is needed to determine if joint
meetings are appropriate and acceptable to the tribes.
When all considerations are complete, the Corps decides to either issue or deny the
permit. When a denial is warranted, a written explanation will be provided to the
applicant. The Corps makes every effort to process Individual Permit applications within
120 days of the submitted application. In controversial projects or projects dealing with
endangered species or other concerns, the processing time may be greater than 120 days.
Permission to alter Corps Civil Works Projects. Permission under Section 14 of the
Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (codified in 33 USC 408), commonly
referred to as Section 408, is required for activities within the lands and real property
interests identified and acquired for Corps Civil Works projects by any entity other than
the Corps. Under Section 408, the Corps grants permission for the alteration, occupation
or use of a Corps Civil Works project when the Corps determines the activity will not be
injurious to the public interest and will not impair the usefulness of the project. Proposed
alterations vary in size, level of complexity, and potential impacts. Procedures and
information required to make a determination are scalable. Based on the proposed
alteration, Corps Districts determine data, analyses and documentation necessary for the
evaluation.
The Basic Section 408 Request and Determination Process. The Corps follows
procedures in Engineer Circular 1165-2-216, Policy and Procedural Guidance for
Processing Requests to Alter U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works Projects
Pursuant to 33 U.S.C. § 408. Each district office has a designated Section 408
coordinator to assist and facilitate the reviews. The following are the basic steps for a
Section 408 determination. Depending on the activity, not all steps may be required or
steps can be conducted concurrently. It is important to note that many Corps Civil Works
projects have a non-federal sponsor responsible for operations and maintenance of the
project and must be involved in the Section 408 determination if they are not the
requester of the activity.
16Step 1: Pre-Coordination. Early coordination between the Corps, the requester and/or
the non-federal sponsor, is strongly recommended and will aid in identifying potential
issues, focusing efforts, minimizing costs, and protecting sensitive information.
Step 2: Written Request. Section 408 process initiation begins with the written request
and is used by the Corps District to determine documentation and approval requirements.
Step 3: Required Documentation. The documentation outline is necessary for the Corps
District to determine whether the proposed alteration would impair the usefulness of the
project or be injurious to the public interest. This documentation includes technical
analyses and environmental compliance documentation as deemed necessary by the
Corps District.
Step 4: Corps Formal Review Process. The Corps District determines the level of review
which is scalable based on the scope and complexity of the activity. Higher level review
and decision may be required based on the potential impacts of the proposed activity.
Step 5: Final Determination. Reviews and the final determination will be documented in
a Summary of Findings, which the Corps District will issue as the official notification to
the requester.
Close coordination is required when a Section 408 request also requires a Section 10,
404, or 103 decision. Section 10/404/103 decisions are separate from Section 408
decisions and require separate documentation. However, the information required to
make those separate determinations should be leveraged. A Section 408 request decision
must be made prior to a Section 10/404/103 decision being issued.
Example of coordination between Section 10/404 and Section 408: A submarine cable
was being installed in association with an offshore wind farm, and would pass beneath
the Federal shore stabilization project in Atlantic City. The requester was made aware of
the Section 408 requirement, and the Section 408 and Regulatory permit review process
were carried out concurrently, which minimized impacts to the project schedule. Early
awareness of the Section 408 requirement, and early coordination between the Section
408 coordinator and the requester is important to ensure timely and effective reviews for
the applicant.
The Corps encourages an applicant to contact the Corps District, or the appropriate
District field office, to request a pre-application consultation. Pre-application
consultation may involve one or more meetings between an applicant, Corps district staff,
and other federal, state or Tribal regulatory and resource agencies. The basic purpose of
the consultation is to provide an opportunity for the applicant to learn about the Corps
and other agencies’ concerns with the potential location and type of proposed project,
assess the viability of the different alternatives to accomplishing the project purpose,
discuss measures for reducing the impacts of the project, and to inform the applicant of
the factors the Corps must consider in its decision making process. If the activity may
17affect federally listed threatened and/or endangered species, critical habitat, historic
properties, EFH, or Tribal trust resources, the agencies would discuss with the applicant
information that will likely be necessary to conduct these consultations.
The benefit of a pre-application consultation is maximized when the applicant brings a
project at a stage with enough level of detail on location and extent of the proposed
impacts for a meaningful discussion, but still flexible enough to incorporate agencies’
concerns to avoid and minimize proposed impacts to jurisdictional resources.
One challenge with the pre-application process is the lack of specificity on cable route. In
situations where there have been pre-application requests for guidance on burial depths
for a non-specific cable route, the ACOE can only provide very general information
which is subject to change based on future project details. The Corps might not schedule
pre-applications meetings with applicants until project descriptions and drawings which
depict their proposed cable routes are provided. This should be done in advance of the
meeting so that the materials can be reviewed and prepared to provide substantive
comments. Also, it is important that the applicant identify the locations of associated
shoreline facilities or cable landing methods that might result in additional impacts to
jurisdictional resources (e.g. coastal wetlands).
Leasing and Permitting for Oil and Gas Development
Oil and Gas development in U.S. waters is regulated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management (“BOEM”) and by FERC. Each operates under separate authority and has
separate missions divided by location and type of the activity.
Statutory Authority. BOEM is a bureau in the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”)
that manages the offshore energy resources of OCS. The passage of the OCSLA
authorized the Secretary of the Interior to grant mineral leases and to prescribe
regulations governing oil and natural gas activities on OCS lands in a manner that
protects human, marine, and coastal environments. OCSLA’s Congressional Declaration
of Policy, provided with amendments passed in 1978, states the OCS should be made
available for expeditious and orderly development, subject to environmental safeguards
while maintaining competition for OCS resources.
BOEM has jurisdiction over offshore energy development in the federal waters of the
OCS. Federal jurisdiction generally covers the area that extends from 3 nautical miles
(5.6 km) to 200 nautical miles along the coastline in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic
Oceans, and the Gulf of Mexico. The only exceptions are in Texas and the west coast of
Florida where state jurisdiction extends to 3 marine leagues or nine nautical miles (16.2
km). Additionally, under principles of international law, federal jurisdiction may extend
beyond 200 miles where it can be shown that the continental shelf physically extends
beyond 200 miles, subject to various measures. (See discussion at
18http://www.boem.gov/Oil-and-Gas-Energy-Program/Leasing/Outer-Continental-
Shelf/Index.aspx)
Leasing Process. BOEM does not propose, construct, operate, or own offshore energy
projects. It issues leases for offshore mineral and energy development and enforces lease
terms and conditions as well as regulations described in 30 C.F.R. Chapter V. Initial
terms for oil and gas leases are 5 years, not to exceed 10 years in areas of unusually deep
water or other unusually adverse conditions. If a discovery is made within the initial term
of an oil and gas lease, the lease is extended as long as oil and/or natural gas is produced
in paying quantities or approved drilling operations are conducted.
Leasing and operational activities on the OCS are also subject to the requirements of
some 30 federal laws such as the NEPA, ESA, and CZMA to name a few. All oil and gas
exploration, development, and production plans are carefully reviewed by BOEM to
ensure they will be performed in an environmentally sound and safe manner.
BOEM is responsible for start-to-finish oversight of each lease for the duration of its
term. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) is responsible for
safety and enforcement responsibilities, including operations, inspections, and
environmental compliance.
The leasing process begins with the development of a Five Year Program pursuant to
Section 18 of the OCSLA. The Five Year Program process includes:
● three separate comment periods,
● three proposals,
● final secretarial approval, and
● the development of an EIS.
The statutorily-mandated process usually takes about two and a half years and includes
the coordination of multiple federal agencies, state, local, tribal input, and other
stakeholders, including energy and non-energy industries, environmental and other public
interest organizations, and the general public. Before the Secretary of the Interior can
approve the Program, the Proposed Final Five Year Program is sent to the President and
Congress for a minimum of 60 days. No area may be leased unless it is on an approved
Five Year Program schedule of lease sales.
The next stage of the leasing process is the lease sale. The typical first step in the sale
process for an individual area is to publish a Call for Information and Nominations and a
Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS in the Federal Register. Subsequent steps include
preparation of Draft and Final EISs, Proposed and Final Notices of Sale, and consistency
determinations under the CZMA where applicable. Some proposed sale areas may
include an additional first step, a request for industry to express their interest in the
specific area. Leases are generally issued to the highest bidders in a sealed competitive
cash bonus bid process. Such bids are subject to “fair market value” review by BOEM
19and antitrust review by the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission before
a lease is issued.
During the Call comment period, BOEM solicits information for the public about the
identified areas, and individual and private entities have the opportunity to identify areas
where existing infrastructure is located and provide information about any multiple use
conflicts.
BOEM conducts in-depth reviews and must approve lessees’ Exploration Plans and
Development and Production Plans (Development Operation Coordination Documents in
the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico) before any regulated activities can take place.
BOEM conducts project-specific reviews for multiple use conflicts during its reviews of
these plans, such as any conflicts associated with existing infrastructure.
Statutory Authority. FERC is an independent federal agency with a mission to regulate
and oversee energy industries in the economic, environmental, and safety interests of the
American public. FERC’s statutory authority centers on major aspects of the Nation’s
wholesale electric, natural gas, hydroelectric, and oil pipeline industries.
FERC is composed of up to five commissioners who are appointed by the President of
the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate. Commissioners serve
staggered 5-year terms and have an equal vote on the orders through which the FERC
takes action. To avoid any undue political influence or pressure, FERC is a bi-partisan
body and no more than three commissioners may belong to the same political party. The
President appoints one of the Commissioners to be the Chairman of FERC, and the
Chairman is the administrative head of FERC.
Among the areas under FERC’s statutory authority, regulating the construction and
operation of natural gas infrastructure, as well as hydroelectric development (see
renewable energy discussion that follows), are most likely to require coordination with
submarine telecommunication cables.
Natural Gas and Liquefied Natural Gas Permitting Process. FERC’s role in regulating
the natural gas industry is largely defined by the Natural Gas Act of 1938. Under section
3 of the Natural Gas Act, FERC reviews the siting, construction, and operation of
facilities to import and export natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (“LNG”)
terminals. As part of its responsibility, FERC conducts cryogenic design and technical
review of the of the proposed LNG facilities during the authorization process, and
compliance inspections during construction. Once an LNG facility is constructed and
operational, FERC conducts safety, security, infrastructure, and environmental
inspections for the life of the facility.
Under section 7 of the NGA, FERC issues certificates of public convenience and
necessity for the construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines and storage
20facilities. FERC also conducts compliance inspections of the natural gas pipelines and
storage facilities during construction. Although FERC does not have any jurisdiction
over the safety or security of natural gas pipelines or storage facilities once they are in
service, it actively works with other agencies with these responsibilities, most notably the
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the Department of
Transportation.
As required by NEPA, the Commission prepares environmental documents for proposed
natural gas and LNG facilities and acts in conformance with other environmental statutes
as appropriate, including the ESA, NHPA, and CZMA. NEPA, specifically the early
phase of scoping, provides a mechanism for identifying where existing infrastructure
(e.g., submarine cables) may be located.
The Commission’s Pre-filing Review Process is voluntary for interstate natural gas
pipeline, compression, and natural gas storage projects, but required for LNG projects. If
an applicant does not go through pre-filing, the review process (including scoping) will
begin after a formal application is filed with FERC.
Pre-filing is requested by the project sponsor, or applicant. During the pre-filing process,
the applicant submits drafts of its environmental resource reports. These reports contain
the environmental information that is the basis of FERC’s NEPA document. Pre-filing
ends when the project sponsor files an application for a Certificate of Public Convenience
and Necessity (pipeline or storage facilities) under section 7 of the NGA or an
Authorization (for LNG facilities) under section 3 of the NGA. The application includes
both environmental and developmental (e.g., infrastructure) information that staff use to
prepare FERC’s NEPA document. The FERC considers its own staff’s analyses and
recommendations, as well as all other information in the record, including stakeholder
comments, in deciding whether to approve or deny a project. A project found to be in the
Public Convenience and Necessity will be approved. A favorable LNG import or export
project receives an Authorization.
Marine Mineral Leasing
OCSLA also provides BOEM with the authority to issue leases for “non-energy
minerals” (primarily sand and gravel) obtained from the ocean floor. To date, BOEM has
conveyed rights to millions of cubic yards of OCS sand for coastal restoration projects in
multiple states.
The Bureau uses two types of lease conveyances for sand and gravel and other non-
energy minerals from the OCS. The first type is a non-competitive negotiated agreement
(“NNA”) or Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”), which can only be used for obtaining
sand and gravel for public works projects funded in part or whole by a federal, state, or
local government agency. Marine minerals leases or negotiated agreements are project
dependent, typically lasting between 2 and 4 years. NNAs are held between BOEM and
a state agency while a MOA is issued for a partnership between BOEM and another
federal agency. The second type is a competitive lease sale in which any qualified person
21may submit a bid. To date, all leases for marine minerals on the OCS have been NNAs
for beach nourishment and coastal restoration projects.
Preparation of a noncompetitive agreement is a multi-step process that typically takes 12-
14 months to complete. It involves technical and environmental review of the request
and project, including preparation of an environmental analysis (EA or EIS), completion
of a MOA with any federal agency participating in the project, signing of the agreement
instrument with terms and conditions, and formal notification of House and Senate
committees when the agreement has been signed.
Through these processes, BOEM ensures that all federally-regulated marine minerals
activities are performed in an environmentally sound and safe manner, and that any
potential adverse impacts to the marine, coastal and/or human environments are avoided
or minimized. BSEE’s role in federal marine mineral leasing is limited to addressing use
conflict issues with pipelines.
More information about BOEM’s Marine Mineral Program (“MMP”), such as key
program statistics and summaries of various sand management working group meetings,
can be found on BOEM’s MMP website.
Authorizing Renewable Energy Development
As with traditional energy, renewable energy development in U.S. waters is also
regulated by BOEM and FERC. Again, the type of activity and its location determines
the role of each agency.
Statutory Authority. In 1920, the U.S. Congress passed the Federal Water Power Act,
which provided the Federal Power Commission (“FPC”), FERC’s predecessor, its
original authority to license and regulate non-federal hydropower projects. As the
regulatory authority of the FPC expanded, the Federal Water Power Act became Part I of
the Federal Power Act (“FPA”). The FPA has been amended over the years by the
Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Energy
Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct”), and the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013.
FERC relies on these authorities to carry out its hydropower responsibilities, including:
(1) the issuance of preliminary permits; (2) the issuance of licenses for the construction
and operation of new projects; (3) the issuance of relicenses for existing projects; (4) the
investigation and assessment of headwater benefits; and (5) the oversight of all ongoing
project operations, including dam safety and security inspections, public safety, and
environmental monitoring.
FERC’s responsibility under the FPA is to strike an appropriate balance among the many
competing developmental and non-developmental (including environmental) interests.
These responsibilities are complicated by other statutes that affect hydropower
regulations, which include, but are not limited to, NEPA, Clean Air Act, ESA, Fish and
Wildlife Coordination Act, CZMA, and NHPA.
22For purposes of administering Part I of the FPA, hydropower includes not only
conventional and pumped storage projects, but MHK projects as well.45 Ocean-based
projects have the potential to require coordination with submarine telecommunication
cables.
Hydropower/Hydrokinetic Licensing Process. Part of the FERC’s mission involves
promoting the development of a strong national energy infrastructure that includes
hydropower, which is currently the leading renewable energy source in the United States.
Congress charged FERC with evaluating whether proposed non-federal hydropower
projects should be approved, including MHK projects as well as conventional and
pumped storage projects. Wind turbines are not considered hydrokinetic, and FERC has
no jurisdiction over such projects.
FERC does not propose, construct, operate, or own such projects. It issues preliminary
permits and licenses for hydropower projects, enforces the conditions of each license for
the duration of its term, and conducts project safety and environmental inspections.
Preliminary permits maintain a permittee’s priority to file a license application while it
gathers data and studies the feasibility of developing a proposed project at a particular
site. Permits expire after 3 years; they do not authorize any land-disturbing activities,
project construction, or installation. During the term of the permit, a permittee prepares
an application for an original hydropower license. An original hydropower license
authorizes the construction and operation of a project for a term of up to 50 years. A new
license, also called a relicense, authorizes the continued operation of an existing
(previously licensed) project, and the license term may be 30 to 50 years.
The licensing process formally begins with the applicant filing a Notice of Intent and a
Preliminary Application Document (initial proposal and information document) to begin
the pre-filing licensing process. The process involves FERC staff working with the
prospective applicant and stakeholders to develop a science-based study plan to obtain
information on a variety of resources (e.g., water quality, fish, wildlife, recreation,
operational considerations, and existing infrastructure) that will facilitate and inform
FERC staff’s NEPA review. Studies typically take 1-2 years to complete, and the study
results are used to develop the license application. The final step in the pre-filing stage is
the prospective applicant’s filing of a Preliminary Licensing Proposal, which describes
the proposed project, its operations, and other infrastructure considerations, and includes
an environmental review of the proposed action.
The post-filing phase of the licensing process begins with the filing of a final license
application, which includes: (1) a detailed description of the project facilities and its
operation; (2) a description of the applicant’s proposal; (3) a description of existing
environmental resources and infrastructure affected by the project; and (4) an evaluation
of the effects of the proposed project on those resources. All comments and
45 A hydrokinetic project is a project that generates electricity from waves or directly from the flow of
water in ocean currents, tides, or inland waterways without the use of a dam or reservoir.
23recommendations filed on the license application are considered by FERC staff in
developing its NEPA document.
After construction is complete, FERC staff conducts periodic safety inspections to ensure
safe project operation, as well as environmental inspections to ensure that project
operators comply with the environmental conditions required by the license. FERC staff
ensures that any required plans (e.g., aquatic habitat, recreation, shoreline management,
and historic properties management plans, etc.) are developed and implemented
according to the license. During the term of a license, FERC must approve any proposed
changes or amendments to that license.
To facilitate the licensing of hydrokinetic projects, FERC staff issued guidance on
Licensing Hydrokinetic Pilot Projects in 2008, in the form of a white paper. The goal
was to provide a mechanism to expedite license application processing to allow
developers to test new marine and hydrokinetic technologies to determine appropriate
siting of these technologies and to confirm their environmental effects. Developers
would do so while connected to the interstate grid. FERC oversight and opportunities for
input would be maintained. The guidance was intended for small projects, which are able
to be shut down or removed on short notice, and avoid sensitive locations. The resulting
licenses would be short-term and include rigorous environmental monitoring and
safeguards. The guidance clearly stated that it was a staff document and not new
regulation.
In addition, FERC staff developed added internal guidance in 2015 that directed staff to
look at the submarine cable maps to scan for cables near a proposed project site when a
preliminary permit application is received, when a pre(license) application document is
received, or when a draft license application for a pilot project is received. If a submarine
cable appears to be in the vicinity of the proposed project site staff is to: (1) contact the
applicant and, if possible, the cable owner, to notify them of the issue; (2) direct the
developer to consult; and (3) add the cable owner to the mailing list for the project. If
the cable owner cannot be identified via the maps, a staff person has been designated to
reach out to the FCC, Navy, or the cable industry trade association, as appropriate, to try
to identify and obtain contact information for the cable owner.46
In the end, FERC determines whether issuing a license for a project is in the public
interest and, if so, what operational conditions and other environmental measures to
include in the license. In so doing, FERC bases its licensing decisions on the public
record for the project, including FERC staff’s NEPA document and the comments filed
on that document.
46 FERC also requires applicants for a preliminary permit to send a copy of the preliminary permit
application to the FCC, the Naval Seafloor Cable Protection Office, and the NOAA Charting Branch
within five days of receiving FERC’s letter accompanying the notice accepting the application for
review. FERC does not, however, require that the FCC or the Navy provide an affirmative or negative
response to the notification.
24Statutory Authority. EPAct amended OCSLA to provide BOEM with the authority to
issue leases, easements and rights of way for certain renewable energy projects on the
OCS. EPAct provided a general framework for BOEM to follow when authorizing these
renewable energy activities. For example, OCSLA as amended requires that for
renewable energy projects, BOEM coordinate with relevant Federal agencies and affected
state and local governments, obtain fair return for leases and grants issued, and ensure
that renewable energy development takes place in a safe and environmentally responsible
manner that considers other users of the OCS.
In 2009, President Barack Obama and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced
the finalization of regulations governing BOEM’s OCS Renewable Energy Program.
These regulations provide a detailed structure to govern how BOEM manages its
Renewable Energy Program, ensure that BOEM meets its statutory obligations, and
provide both certainty and flexibility for overseeing the nascent offshore renewable
energy industry. Also in 2009, FERC and BOEM finalized a Memorandum of
Understanding (“MOU”) to establish jurisdiction over OCS MHK projects, which
establishes that BOEM will issue leases for the siting of OCS MHK projects and FERC
will issue licenses governing the operations of OCS MHK projects. This MOU and the
resulting guidelines are discussed further in section 66 of this report.
Renewable Energy Leasing. BOEM’s offshore wind authorization process can be
broken down into four phases: planning, leasing, site assessment, and construction and
operations.
The offshore wind planning process typically begins with the establishment of an
Intergovernmental Renewable Energy Task Force. BOEM currently establishes its Task
Forces on a state-by-state basis, and coordinates with the members of each Task Force in
order to inform how and whether renewable energy planning and leasing should proceed
offshore that state.
Though there are different paths provided for in BOEM’s renewable energy regulations,
after delineation of a planning area in coordination with the applicable Task Force and/or
receiving an unsolicited application identifying a particular area from a developer,
BOEM will typically publish one or more Federal Register notices to determine whether
there is competitive interest in the area identified and gather comments from the public.
If there is competitive interest, then BOEM will follow a competitive planning and
leasing process that involves steps similar to those included in the agency’s oil and gas
lease sale process. This includes the step of Area Identification to establish a Wind
Energy Area, conducting the necessary environmental reviews to inform a potential
leasing action, the publication of sale notices detailing the proposed lease sale, and
holding an auction to award one or more leases to the winning bidder(s).
25If there is not competitive interest, then after the completion of necessary environmental
reviews, BOEM may begin with negotiating the terms of the lease with the one interested
developer prior to lease issuance.
BOEM solicits comments from stakeholders at several points during its planning and
leasing process. Stakeholders are encouraged to provide information and feedback
during the comment periods associated with a Request for Interest, Call for Information
and Nominations, and Proposed Sale Notice. There are also one or more comment
periods to inform BOEM’s pre-lease NEPA process. Finally, BOEM encourages
stakeholders to observe its Task Force meetings and provide feedback during the
subsequent public Q&A session.
After lease issuance, the lessee begins the site assessment term of their lease and has
approximately five years to complete the necessary site characterization and assessment
activities. If a lessee is proposing to install a meteorological tower or buoy to gather
resource data on the leasehold, then the lessee must submit a Site Assessment Plan that
describes these activities for BOEM’s approval.
The final phase of the process, construction and operations, begins with the submission of
a Construction and Operations Plan (“COP”). The COP provides the lessee’s detailed
plan for the construction and operation of a wind energy project in the lease area. BOEM
will conduct thorough engineering and environmental reviews of the COP, likely to
include an EIS. BOEM will also examine each COP to evaluate the potential for
interference or harm to other uses and users of the OCS. After completing its reviews,
BOEM will approve, disapprove, or approve with modifications the COP. The approval,
or approval with modifications, of a COP is the last BOEM approval necessary before the
lessee may construct and operate their project. BOEM’s offshore wind leases typically
include a 25-year operations term.
There are a number of opportunities for the public to provide input in the NEPA process
associated with BOEM’s plan review. For example, stakeholders can provide comments
during comment periods and participate in public meetings. There is also the opportunity
to observe Task Force meetings held to discuss the specifics of the proposed project.
With regard to BSEE’s safety and enforcement oversight obligations, the division of
responsibility is still underway for BOEM’s renewable energy program.
BOEM has developed a number of national and regional guidelines to provide its
renewable energy lessees with additional information and guidance for compliance with
its regulations, standards and other requirements.47 Certain guidelines provide
information to lessees relating to how BOEM expects those lessees to coordinate with
other ocean users in order to obtain information BOEM needs to conduct its plan reviews,
such as its Guidelines for Providing Information on Fisheries Social and Economic
47 BOEM’s renewable energy guidelines can be found at: http://www.boem.gov/National-and-Regional-
Guidelines-for-Renewable-Energy-Activities/
26Conditions for Renewable Energy Development on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf
and its Guidelines for Information Requirements for a Renewable Energy COP.
Specifically, BOEM’s Guidelines for Information Requirements for a Renewable Energy
Construction and Operations Plan provide guidance to lessees regarding the information
BOEM would expect to receive in a COP in the event that the lessee’s proposed project
area is traversed by one or more telecommunications cables.
BOEM provides a lease and grant information on its Renewable Energy Program
webpage as well as detailed information about BOEM’s renewable energy activities
offshore specific coastal states. This information includes:
● published planning and leasing notices, such as: a Call for Information and
Nominations, the Notice of Intent to Prepare an EA, Proposed Sale Notices, Final
Sale Notices, and associated public comments and a summary of commercial
nominations;
● individual submitted project plans;
● executed leases;
● Task Force and public meeting summaries;
● press releases.
Comments and recommendations made by other governmental agencies, other
stakeholders, and the public are taken into account by BOEM as the agency moves
through its various decision-making processes.
Permitting and Exclusions (and Mitigation) Involving Marine Protected Areas
and Species
Offices within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) are
charged with protecting coastal and marine resources. The Office of National Marine
Sanctuaries (“ONMS”) regulations have established permit procedures and have the
responsibility for permit review and issuance for projects including submarine cable
installations within National Marine Sanctuaries. National Marine Fisheries Service is
the trustee for coastal and marine resources including commercial and recreational
fisheries, marine mammals, and endangered and threatened species and their habitats.
Submarine cabling consultations most likely to be triggered occur under the ESA,
MMPA, or MSA.
Most cable projects will require a permit from the ACOE pursuant to the Corps’ authority
under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act or Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
If the ONMS decides to authorize another agency’s permit (rather than issue a sanctuary
permit), a permit from the ACOE would be a likely vehicle through which ONMS could
authorize cable projects in cases where a permit or a special use permit is not available.
The FCC has rules that clarify that: (1) there is no requirement to include a CZMA
consistency certification in a cable landing license application filed under FCC’s rules
unless the FCC licensing process is a listed activity in a state’s federally-approved coastal
27management program; (2) the applicant must promptly report to the FCC pursuant to
FCC’s rules, if a state timely requests consistency review of the unlisted activity within
the 30-day period prescribed by NOAA’s regulations; (3) upon expiration of that 30-day
period, the applicant must file a report with FCC on the extent to which the affected
states have waived, or are deemed to have waived, consistency review of the unlisted
activity; and (4) applies to those states that have waived, or are deemed to have waived,
any right to review the application under the CZMA.
Regulatory Authority. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. § 1431 et seq.)
(“NMSA”) requires the designation and management of the marine environment with
nationally significant aesthetic, ecological, historical, or recreational values as national
marine sanctuaries. The ONMS of NOAA has issued regulations to implement this act,
safeguard resources within sanctuary boundaries, and prohibit the conduct of some
activities (15 CFR Part 922).
The CZMA, federal consistency provision (16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A)) and NOAA’s
CZMA regulations (15 C.F.R. Part 930, Subpart D), outline that an applicant for an FCC
submarine cable license may have to submit a CZMA consistency certification to a
coastal state for review. NOAA and the FCC previously collaborated with each other to
clarify the application of the CZMA when FCC amended its cable licensing regulations
in 2010.
In most national marine sanctuaries it is unlawful to alter or place material on the seabed
or submerged lands unless conducted pursuant to a sanctuary permit or other
authorization. Since cable installation activities require seabed disturbance or placement
of material on the seabed, cable installation is prohibited in most sanctuaries. However,
certain prohibited activities may be authorized to the extent they are compatible with the
resource protection mandate of the NMSA and meet the regulatory requirements for a
sanctuary permit or authorization. Submarine cable installation and maintenance has
been permitted in sanctuaries using a sanctuary general permit, special use permit
(“SUP”), authorization, or combination of the three tools.
Sanctuary General Permits. Most sanctuaries have regulations that allow permits to be
issued for activities that would otherwise be prohibited when those activities are related
to research, education, or management related to the goals and objectives of the
sanctuary. Additional permit categories are available for Indian tribal welfare (Olympic
Coast National Marine Sanctuary) and for furthering sanctuary purposes (Florida Keys
National Marine Sanctuary). These permit categories are included here because they
could potentially allow installation and maintenance of submarine cables at these two
sanctuaries. In order to qualify for a regulatory general permit, a cable project must meet
the purposes of an ONMS permit category.
Special Use Permits. The NMSA also provides authority to issue SUPs for specific
activities and for the collection of fees for the conduct of any activity under a SUP.
28SUPs are issued for specific activities in a sanctuary only if such authorization is
necessary: (1) to establish conditions of access to and use of any sanctuary resource; or
(2) to promote public use and understanding of a sanctuary resource. Should ONMS
determine that a special use permit is appropriate for the continued presence and
operation of a specific submarine cable project, it will process the application consistent
with Section 310 of the NMSA. The notice specifies that the continued presence of
commercial submarine cables beneath or on the seabed will be subject to the
requirements of special use permits.
ONMS has adopted a methodology for determining the fair market value of special use
permits.48
Authorizations. In certain sanctuaries ONMS can also authorize an otherwise prohibited
activity if that activity is permitted by a valid lease, permit, license, approval or other
authorization issued by any federal, state, or local authority of competent jurisdiction.
Such approval by the sanctuary superintendent is known as an “authorization.” The
authority to issue authorizations is limited to the following sanctuaries: Florida Keys,
Flower Garden Banks, Monterey Bay, Stellwagen Bank, Olympic Coast, and Thunder
Bay.
National Marine Fisheries Service (“NMFS”) is the trustee for coastal and marine
resources including commercial and recreational fisheries, marine mammals, and
endangered and threatened species and their habitats. Submarine cabling consultations
are most likely to be triggered under the ESA, MMPA, or MSA.
Under the ESA §7(a)(2),federal agencies must insure that any action authorized, funded
or carried out by the agency is not likely to (1) jeopardize the continued existence of any
endangered or threatened species; (2) result in the destruction or adverse modification of
habitat of such species; or (3) result in adverse modification of habitat of such species.
Any agency determining an endangered species or critical habitat, under NOAA
jurisdiction, may be adversely impacted is required to consult with NOAA Fisheries to
avoid, minimize, and mitigate any harm, prior to the authorization of any take.
The MMPA prohibits the take of marine mammals unless exempted by the MMPA or
authorized under a permit. Take is broadly defined as to harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or
attempt to harass, hunt, capture or kill. Sections 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) allow for the
authorization of the incidental taking of marine mammals that occur during otherwise
lawful activities, if it is found that the total taking will have a negligible impact on the
affected species (or stock) and that the total taking will not have an unmitigatable adverse
impact. In the case of a submarine cable installation, a 101(a)(5)(D) Incidental
48 NOAA, Fair Market Value Analysis for a Fiber Optic Cable Permit in National Marine Sanctuaries,
Final Report (Aug. 2002), http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/library/pdfs/fmv_focpermit_final_2002.pdf.
29Harassment Authorization is the most likely permit sought. The MMPA permits are only
issued by NMFS headquarters, however, all other consultations occur in the appropriate
regional office. If approved, the Incidental Harassment Authorization authorizes
incidental harassment, but not mortality, for permissible methods of taking and
mitigation, monitoring and reporting requirements, and is valid for up to one year.
Habitat loss is one of the greatest long term threats to commercial and recreational
fisheries. Under the MSA, §3(10), EFH is defined as those waters and substrate
necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Some subsets of
EFH merit special attention and are identified as Habitat Areas of Particular Concern.
These areas are considered high priority for conservation, management, and research, and
increased conservation measures may be warranted. EFH is designated by Fishery
Management Councils and described in Fishery Management Plans. Under §305 (b)(2)
Federal Agencies must consult with NOAA Fisheries on any action or proposed action
that a federal agency authorizes, funds, or undertakes that may adversely affect EFH. If a
federal agency determines an action will adversely affect EFH, then the federal agency
must provide NOAA Fisheries with a written assessment of the effects of the action on
EFH, with detail commensurate with the complexity and magnitude of the potential
adverse effects of the action. NOAA Fisheries will work with the agency to identify
ways to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and offset any impacts from the proposed action.
Commercial and Tribal Fishing
The submarine cable industry has a long and, and at times, adversarial relationship with
the commercial fishing industry in the US, and indeed throughout the world.
Commercial fishing has been, since the first cables were laid, and continues to be the
cause of the greatest proportion of submarine cable faults. From the perspective of the
commercial fisherman, new submarine cabling restricts some of their “traditional” fishing
grounds. Add to this the fact that submarine cable owners have successfully recouped
damages from those fishermen they could prove damaged their cables and one can easily
see how the tensions developed. Commercial fishing in the U.S. is regulated by the
Regional Fisheries Management Commissions. These Commissions are generally in bio-
geographic regions where groups of species of fish regularly occur and the fishing effort
for those fish can be logically regulated.
From the perspective of the submarine cable owner, not all fishing is the same. The most
harmful to submarine cables are those fisheries which drag nets or dredges across the
bottom in the vicinity of cables. Clam dredges, scallop dredges and otter trawls are those
fishing gears that have the greatest potential to damage a submarine cable. Clam dredges
are generally used in the North Atlantic from about Maryland north. Scallop dredges are
used in various places throughout the U.S. but the main concentration generally overlaps
with that for clam dredges and otter trawls are used throughout the US.
Tribal fisheries do not generally present an additional concern for submarine cable
owners. Ancient artisanal methods pose little danger to submarine cables. Instead, cable
owners work with tribal fishers in the same way they work with others.
30While cable faults in the U.S. due to fishing tend to be lower than in many other regions
of the world, fishing remains one of the primary causes of cable faults on the continental
shelf of the U.S. as noted above. In almost all regions in the US, cable companies and
cable installers have engaged fishing captains, owners and fishing organizations in
discussions on cable routing and protection measures such that fishing activities are
minimally disturbed during the route survey, cable installation and burial program, and
over the life of the system. This process reduces fault rates over the life the system,
assists in reducing objections during the permitting process, and reduces interference of
fishing vessels and gear during the installation. This informal process is followed even in
regions not covered by one of the regional committees noted above (i.e. U.S. east coast as
an example). Route planning engineers arrange meetings and early notice in order to
maintain a good relationship with the fishing community. This communication normally
takes the form of project and route notices, charts, and meetings in key fishing ports. The
process is somewhat more formal in regions covered fishing committees which often
requires a signed MOU and consulting fee for route review and survey consultants.
These relationships have been developed over several decades and have been a critical
step in the process, albeit informal and ad hoc in many cases.
Fisherman/Cable Coordination Committees and Agreements
In several West Coast states, commercial fishermen have entered into contractual
agreements with submarine cable owners. These agreements exist in California, Oregon
and Alaska and the entities formed by the agreements are generally referred to as
cable/fisheries liaison committees. The reasons behind the formation of these committees
are various but key among them is the feeling among fishermen that their livelihoods
were being affected by submarine cables during the boom time at the end of the 1990’s.
Several cable owners were required by local regulators to participate in the liaison
committees as a condition of permitting or receipt of a seabed lease. Some of these
committees require yearly payments on the order of $100K from the cable owner.
Among the provisions of these agreements is the requirement for commercial fishermen
to exercise certain behaviors in the vicinity of a submarine cable or avoid fishing over the
cable entirely for participation in the agreement. Typically the submarine cable owner
will exempt the fishermen from liability in the event they cause a cable break and are
operating under the practices spelled out in the agreement. The Liaison Committees we
are aware of at the time of the drafting of this report are:
 Southern California Cable Fisheries Liaison Committee
 Central California Joint Cable/Fisheries Liaison Committee
 Point Arena Cable Committee
 Bandon Submarine Cable Committee
 Oregon Fishermen’s Cable Committee
 Alaska Fisheries Cable Committee
 South Bay Cable and Fishing Committee
31While the initial method of forming the committees may have been unwelcome to the
cable owners, the results, in terms of the lack of submarine cable faults caused by
commercial fishermen, seem to have been worthwhile.
Military Activities, Exercises and Construction
Large portions of oceans within the U.S. EEZ are used for military exercises. These areas
are called Department of Defense Operating Areas. The majority of these areas are not
exclusively reserved for military use. However, some portions of the areas are closed to
vessel traffic at particular times to limit exposure to dangerous activities. The military
exercises can pose a threat to cable ships during installation and repair. Vessel operations
must be coordinated with the military to ensure that there are not scheduling conflicts
between the cable ship and exercises involving live fire or other military activities.
Because exercises can last for weeks, cable installations can be significantly impacted if
the schedules are not coordinated in advance.
In addition, there are cabled military ranges where ships and aircraft operate over an
instrumented seabed. Military ranges fall generally within the outer boundaries of the
operating areas. Portions of the ranges close to shore are charted as restricted areas, but
the cables and instruments can extend well beyond those boundaries. These ranges
should be avoided by cable route planners, as repair operations to either the commercial
cable or the range cables would be significantly complicated by the presence of the other.
Construction of new ranges and other cables is completed in accordance with the NEPA,
Executive Order 12114, and various Navy procedures. The construction process is
similar to the construction of new commercial cables, with environmental studies and
acquisition of applicable permits.
In order to ensure that industry has a means of communicating with Navy regarding cable
installation and repair, Navy operates the Naval Seafloor Cable Protection Office
(“NSCPO”). The NSCPO maintains a database of commercial and government cables
and acts as a liaison between the Navy and the cable industry. When Navy is planning
new construction in the vicinity of commercial cables, NSCPO will reach out to cable
owners in order to minimize conflicts. Alternately, Navy requests that industry inform
NSCPO of new construction projects so that impacts to naval facilities and operations can
be evaluated and resolved. The Navy, represented by NSCPO, is a member of the
International Cable Protection Committee. New cable construction, repairs, and cable
recoveries all create an impediment in the water column. The U.S. Navy categorizes
these as fixed hazards and requires submarines to keep clear. In order to do so, Navy
asks that cable construction companies file broadcast warnings and notices to mariners,
and contact the NSCPO.
Key State and Local Regulatory Activities
U.S. state/territorial environmental regulators generally take the lead role in the combined
state and federal permitting processes for new cable landings. While each state and
territory has a different process, generally there is an environmental review under NEPA
32and state regulations and a separate granting of a seabed lease. After the state regulators
have reviewed and approved a project, the ACOE will complete its process.
In addition to NEPA, several coastal states, such as New York, California, and
Washington, have state-law equivalent statues that resemble NEPA and require different
levels of detail in thee technical analysis of impacts. These statutes present similar
advantages and disadvantages as NEPA when it comes to cable protection.
For example, in California the California State Lands Commission (“CSLC”) performs
the environmental review and writes the environmental document (EIS or Negative
Mitigated Declaration) associated with the granting of the lease of State Sovereign
Submerged Lands. Staff time for these activities is reimbursed by the submarine cable
owner. In areas where the seabed is owned by a local jurisdiction, that town will
complete a similar process. The California Coastal Commission conducts their own
review after the CSLC (or local entity) has completed theirs. Only after these regulators
have reviewed the project and added in appropriate mitigation will the ACOE perform
their review and add in any additional mitigation efforts they feel may be needed. This
environmental review process, in recent years, has taken approximately 2 years to
complete.
The State of Oregon follows a similar method in which the Oregon Department of State
Lands is the lead agency in the environmental review process and the ACOE comments
at the end of the process.
Both Oregon and California have, as a condition of the State Lands Lease, a requirement
to periodically re-inspect the cable to verify burial. Currently re-inspections occur every
2-5 years depending on the age of the cable. Re-inspections generally show that there is
no change in the burial status of the cable over time.
Local permitting is generally focused on road and beach opening permits, compliance
with noise, water, and air pollution requirements, and acquisition of easements.
In addition, certain states require compliance with air quality regulations both for the
cable station equipment (i.e., emergency generators) and vessel emissions.
Existing Coordination Problems
The United States lacks a regulator with regulatory and planning oversight over all
marine and coastal activity. Instead, the United States has a fragmented system of
federal, state, local, and tribal regulations that is largely activity or industry-specific.
Moreover, unlike other countries such as Australia and New Zealand, the United States
lacks a robust submarine cable protection regime to highlight the economic and national-
security importance of submarine cables and to require that other proposed marine and
coastal activities account for and minimize the risk of damage to submarine cables.
This fragmented system of regulation and planning has resulted in a number of particular
coordination problems that exacerbate risks to submarine cables, including gaps in actual
33or perceived legal authorities, gaps in how existing legal authority is exercised, lack of
familiarity with submarine cable technologies and installation and repair operations, and
lack of clarity in procedures for consultation between relevant agencies when other
marine activities are proposed for permitting in proximity to submarine cables. Existing
coordination problems should inform recommendations for enhancing coordination
without increasing regulatory burdens. One of the most pressing elements of the
coordination issue is to ensure the entity requesting the action engage as early in the
process as possible and on as broad of a spectrum of stakeholders as possible. Often the
“new action” may not be aware of all the aspects and elements of the maritime
environment and unsure of where to turn or how to engage. In all cases, coordination
among diverse maritime industries and their infrastructure, such as pipelines, energy
projects, and power transmission cables, is in all parties’ best interests.
NEPA Alone Is Insufficient to Ensure Protection of Submarine Cables
Existing U.S. authorizing statutes do not include a specific requirement to consider cable
protection when federal or state agencies are considering a new use in proximity to
submarine cables. Damaging a submarine cable through culpable negligence or
intentional action is a violation of U.S. and some U.S. state laws. U.S. law also imposes
prohibits fishing vessels from interfering with cable ships or buoys marking a cable when
using nets. However, these prohibitions are not incorporated into permitting processes or
standards. Marine spatial planning has not progressed to the point of requiring a cable
protection analysis except in individual jurisdictions such as Oregon.49
The NEPA requires environmental impact analysis of new marine uses if a federal
approval is required. NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the direct and indirect
environmental impacts of actions which may significantly affect a broad definition of the
environment, which includes the built environment. Submarine cables fit within this
broad definition and therefore impacts of new marine uses on submarine cables can be
analyzed under NEPA. In practice, however, NEPA’s utility as a cable protection tool is
limited.
However, in the experience of the telecommunications cable industry, there are several
limitations to relying only on NEPA analyses to provide for sufficient protection for
telecommunications cables.
First, some agencies do not interpret “environment” to refer to existing infrastructure. In
that case, the proposed action’s potential impacts to telecommunications cables would not
be thoroughly analyzed. For example, while cables are considered critical
telecommunications infrastructure and the integrity and resilience of such networks can
have safety and national security implications, these factors may not be considered part of
a typical “environmental” impact analysis. This inconsistency makes it difficult to
predict the extent to which impacts to existing infrastructure will be analyzed in a NEPA
document.
49 See CSRIC Spatial Separation Report 1, at 10-11, Appendix C.
34Second, agencies generally require project developers to provide a description of existing
infrastructure to help inform the agency’s NEPA analysis. Nevertheless, if a potential
developer is unaware of the existence of submarine cables in its proposed project area,
submarine cables may not be identified for NEPA analysis. This would need to be
remedied either by the agency itself identifying the need to analyze potential impacts to
telecommunications cables, or through this issue being raised by commenters during a
comment period associated with the preparation of the NEPA document.
Finally, NEPA is a procedural statute in that it establishes an environmental review
process that can help to inform agencies’ decision-making. Ultimately the law lacks any
substantive requirements that obligate an agency to select any particular alternative. For
example, NEPA would not require an agency to select the alternative that presents the
fewest impacts to other uses of the proposed project area.
These issues illustrate that NEPA’s utility as a cable protection tool is limited.
Nevertheless, there is opportunity for agencies to coordinate and identify potential
process revisions and improvements outside of NEPA.
In addition to NEPA, several coastal states, such as New York, California, and
Washington, have state-law equivalent statues that resemble NEPA and require different
levels of detail in thee technical analysis of impacts. These statutes present similar
advantages and disadvantages as NEPA when it comes to cable protection.
Many Permitting Regulations Do Not Require Identification of Submarine
Cables or Coordination with Cable Operators, Other Agencies
In addition to NEPA, the authorization of marine activities that potentially impact
submarine cables typically requires agency approvals under various federal and state
permitting statutes. These, however, in some instances only focus on particular specific
impacts that are the focus of the permitting statute.50 Where the consideration of potential
adverse effects is of a more general nature, as with NEPA, there is no specific provision
for submarine cables,51 and use of these types of provisions to protect submarine cables
raise identical issues.
Identification of cables should occur as early as possible in the stages of conceptualizing
and site identification of a new marine project to avoid potentially significant adverse
interactions.
50 See, e.g., Army Corps of Engineers permits under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899
(33 U.S.C. § 403) and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. § 344).
51 E.g., Section 10(a)(1) of the Federal Power Act, under which marine energy projects are authorized,
requires, inter alia, that licensed projects be best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or
developing a waterway or waterways for the use or benefit of interstate or foreign commerce and for
other beneficial public uses. 16 U.S.C. § 803(a)(1).
35Importantly, the FCC and the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), which are
responsible for various efforts involving critical infrastructure protection, do not have
direct roles and do not participate (by MOU or other mechanism) in permitting activities
in close proximity to submarine cables. Planning procedures and permitting criteria fail
to require coordination and consultation with the FCC and DHS or otherwise ensure
cable protection is integrated into substantive permitting decisions. The FCC does not
have a defined role in coordination between agencies, by MOU or otherwise, and thus
lacks an adequate reliable procedural mechanism to address potential threats to the
telecommunication network’s integrity, resilience, or reliability raised by activities being
permitted by other agencies.
In practice, it is typically the responsibility of the project applicants to identify the
presence of submarine cables in proximity to a new proposed use of the sea. Without
increased awareness of submarine telecommunications cables and improved coordination
between agencies, the existing regulatory requirements may not be effective.
Agencies and Other Industry Sectors are Unfamiliar with Submarine Cable
Protection and Operation Requirements, Vulnerabilities
Certain state and federal agencies, as well as private sector industries, are unfamiliar with
the presence, operational requirements, vulnerabilities, status as critical
telecommunications infrastructure, and statutory and treaty protections that apply to
cables. Additionally, agencies focused on other resources and infrastructure generally
lack expertise in telecommunication cable technology. Awareness of such expertise
elsewhere in government and access to expertise could improve coordination and analysis
of potential effects on submarine cables.
Public Resources Identifying Existing and Planned Submarine Cables and
Their Owners are Not Fully Utilized
Information about the location of submarine cables is critical to early identification of
potential issues in the planning stages of new marine uses. The Marine Cadastre and the
North American Submarine Cable Association (“NASCA”) websites provide centralized
access to a repository of information identifying existing and planned submarine cables,
including ownership or operator contact information, to facilitate planning and dialogue
among stakeholders. While these sites cannot provide 100% of the current information
required for project engineering, they provide a good baseline of data required for
planning. However, if project proponents and authorizing agencies are not aware of the
importance of this information or its existence, they will not realize that it should be
taken into account. Further development of these sources and use of these tools by
agencies and applicants is essential to detecting potential issues with submarine cables
and other infrastructure resources.
36Absence of a Clear Federal Point of Contact
Terrestrial infrastructure, such as a natural gas pipeline or underground electrical
transmission line, benefits from a “call before you dig” requirement with a clearly
defined hotline that is well-known to relevant stakeholders. Marine infrastructures, such
as submarine cables, lack similar protections and procedures to allow for coordination.
Agencies, project proponents, and cable owners facing a new proposed use, a siting or
planning question, or a potential conflict between uses, lack a simple and straightforward
federal point of contact to begin the coordination process among federal agencies. As
noted above, permitting processes and environmental review have proven inadequate for
this purpose to date. A clear notice requirement and clear point of contact to deliver the
notice would initiate the coordination process and help alleviate greater issues later on.
Existing Interagency and Interjurisdictional Coordination
Mechanisms
To land or operate a submarine cable in the United States, an operator must obtain a cable
landing license from the FCC pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act of 1921. As
described in Section 4.1, the FCC plays a coordinating role in various interagency
processes, and other governmental agencies frequently look to the FCC for guidance on
matters pertaining to submarine cables.
Existing Coordination Mechanisms
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers grants permits for submarine cables as structures
located in the navigable waters of the United States pursuant to the Rivers and Harbors
Act of 1899 and the Clean Water Act, as described in Section 4.2. The Corps typically
completes an environmental review under the NEPA before issuing permits and will
consult with other agencies on fisheries and endangered species issues, including FWS
and NOAA. If a cable system will traverse a national marine sanctuary, the cable owner
must also obtain a permit from the ONMS under the NMSA.
In recent years, federal and state agencies responsible for permitting activities and siting
infrastructure in the ocean employed several strategies to improve coordination efforts
within a complex set of existing statutes and regulations. Individual agencies developed
public and internal guidance to improve coordination with other ocean uses. Agencies
worked together, formally and informally, through the drafting and issuing of joint
guidance, and through the negotiations of agreements such as MOUs. Federal, state, and
regional bodies developed plans to help coordinate future infrastructure siting and other
oceanic activities.
BOEM, FERC, NOAA, and the Corps all provide guidance for maneuvering their
regulatory processes on their web pages, in guidance documents and checklists, and in
communications with project proponents. The agencies also commonly provide internal
guidance to their staff to promote consistent review and, in some cases, coordination with
other agencies and stakeholders in the regulatory process.
37Limiting the effort to one agency makes drafting and vetting language as simple as
possible. Guidance must be vetted to ensure compliance with existing statutes and
regulations, and clarity of language for achieving its purpose. However, general
guidance, as discussed here, is not regulation or policy. It is merely staff’s direction on
how to comply with the regulations and move efficiently through the process. The
advantages of such guidance are speed and simplicity. It is limited, however, to fairly
mechanical matters and to the authority of staff and does not have the imprimatur of the
agency principals or the force of policy, regulation, or statute. Additionally, guidance
documents typically do not undergo the notice-and-comment process associated with
rulemaking efforts, and BOEM, for example, has received feedback recommending its
renewable energy guidelines documents undergo review by parties outside the agency
prior to finalization.52
Federal agencies often recognize the need to document agreements that detail how the
agencies will coordinate and consult on areas of mutual interest or jurisdiction. These
agreements typically take the form of MOUs that require the signature of all parties to the
agreement. Agencies can also coordinate when conducting reviews pursuant to the
NEPA. The CEQ’s regulations implementing NEPA allow federal agencies (as lead
agencies) to invite other federal agencies and tribal, state, and local governments to serve
as cooperating agencies in the preparation of NEPA documents.
Examples
 BOEM invites relevant government entities (federal, state, local, and tribal) to act
as cooperating agencies during its NEPA reviews as a standard approach early in
the process. BOEM tries to be very inclusive in this process, and generally invites
as broad an interagency group as possible to participate.
 In 2009, DOI and FERC developed a formal MOU, signed by the Secretary of the
Interior and the Chairman of FERC, to clarify jurisdictional understandings
regarding MHK energy projects in the offshore waters on the OCS.
 In 2012, BOEM and FERC issued an update to joint Guidelines on Regulation of
Marine and Hydrokinetic Energy Projects on the OCS, originally drafted in 2009,
to clarify the responsibilities of each agency and how to best navigate the process
of obtaining an OCS MHK lease and license, pursuant to the MOU.
 In 2013, USCG and FERC negotiated a formal MOU, signed by the Commandant
of the Coast Guard and the Chairman of FERC, to cooperate as FERC receives
applications to site, construct, and operate hydrokinetic power generation
52 BOEM received comments on this point in response to its recent request for feedback. See Request for
Information on the State of the Offshore Renewable Energy Industry—Request for Feedback;
MMAA104000, 80 Fed. Reg. 58,786 (Sept. 30, 2015.
38equipment and facilities (proposed projects) in waters subject to the jurisdiction of
the United States.
 In 2010, the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Council of
Environmental Quality negotiated a formal MOU with FERC, signed by each
agency’s executive, regarding FERC’s participation on the National Ocean
Council and in marine spatial planning.
 In 2004, FERC was one of 11 agencies to sign a MOU to establish a process to
facilitate the timely review of deep water port applications.
 Established between 2008 and 2010, FERC has MOUs with the states of
California, Oregon, Maine, and Washington to coordinate the review of MHK
energy projects within state waters.
 BOEM and NOAA’s Office for Coastal Management have established the Marine
Cadastre53 website. It is a collection of marine data and a web publishing service
for others who curate their own data. It includes a downloadable layer of cable
data from charts and viewable data including contact information provided by
NASCA.
 BOEM has signed a number of MOUs with other federal agencies in order to
better coordinate its various processes, including:
 In 2009, BOEM and FWS signed a MOU concerning the responsibilities of
federal agencies to protect migratory birds.
 In 2004, the Minerals Management Service (a predecessor agency to BOEM
and BSEE) signed an agreement with the USCG to, in part, foster
communication and cooperation, and to clearly delineate areas of expertise
and jurisdiction. Further, in 2011, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
Regulation and Enforcement (the second predecessor agency to BOEM and
BSEE) signed a MOU with the USCG to identify and clarify the roles and
responsibilities of the two agencies with regard to BOEM’s renewable energy
authorization process.
 The Red Book: In September 1985, a group of the principal agencies involved in
assessing permit applications under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for
federal‐aid highway projects (Federal Highway Administration, USACE, EPA,
FWS, and NMFS) formed a workgroup to identify methods for improving
interagency coordination and conducting more efficient (e.g., concurrent) reviews.
The end result was a handbook entitled “Applying the Section 404 Permit Process
to Federal‐Aid Highway Projects,” more commonly known as the Red Book,
released in September 1988. In 2012, the Transportation Rapid Response
Team—a federal interagency group launched in November 2011 to streamline
federal reviews of transportation projects—expressed a renewed interest in the
concept of concurrent review processes covered in the original Red Book. A new
interagency workgroup consisting of FHWA, FRA, USACE, USCG, EPA, FWS,
53 http://marinecadastre.gov/
39and NMFS was formed in late 2013 to update the 1988 Red Book. The 2015 Red
Book was finalized in September 2015, and has been posted at
https://www.environment.fhwa.dot.gov/strmlng/RedBook_2015.asp
The Red Book provides a “how‐to” on synchronizing the NEPA and other
regulatory reviews such as ACOE’s Section 10/404 review, USCG’s bridge
permit reviews, and the ESA’s consultation for field staff of federal agencies that
review permit applications and federal, state, and local agencies that fund or
develop transportation projects. It includes techniques and lessons learned that
can support more efficient and concurrent review processes. While the document
focuses primarily on the transportation sector, transferability of these techniques
to other infrastructure sectors are noted.
Communication Methods, Pros, and Cons. Developing interagency agreements fosters
communication and understanding among the staff at the participating agencies. Once
established, the resulting agreement must be communicated to the agency staff who will
be implementing it and those stakeholders affected by it. A MOU often lacks the level of
detail needed for day-to-day implementation and may need to be followed by a less
formal and more flexible mechanism, such as a letter or memorandum of agreement, joint
guidance, or responses to frequently asked questions.
While an informal agreement is less complex than a formal one, the involvement of
multiple agencies still adds a significant challenge. Differences in decision structure,
culture, and terminology require effort to overcome. Formal MOUs start with the same,
interagency challenges, but require additional work to gain a high level of approval to
receive the signature of an agency principal.
Generally, federal agencies have found that cooperating agency participation in a NEPA
review enhances the quality of its NEPA documents, provides for efficiencies in the
NEPA review process, and improves communication and understanding.
Existing and future ocean-based infrastructure are major concerns. Planning efforts
should focus on centrally gathering available information, coordinating and streamlining
regulatory processes, and educating stakeholders about the regulatory process in order to
maximize input.
Examples
 BOEM’s primary mechanism of informally coordinating and consulting with its
intergovernmental partners with regards to a particular potential renewable energy
lease area is through the establishment of its Intergovernmental Task Forces.
BOEM’s Intergovernmental Task Forces are currently established on a state-by-
state basis, and include officials from relevant and potentially affected federal
agencies and elected state, local, and federally-recognized tribal officials (or their
40designated representatives). These Task Forces help to inform all stages of
BOEM’s renewable energy authorization (planning, leasing, site assessment,
construction, and operations) and are particularly valuable in helping BOEM
understand the issues on the landscape and identify areas where, because of
potential multiple-use or environmental conflicts, renewable energy development
may not be appropriate. Though BOEM’s current Task Force structure does not
enable participation by non-government entities, those entities are always
welcome to observe Task Force meetings, and BOEM holds a Q&A session
immediately following each Task Force meeting during which other stakeholders
can raise issues or ask questions.
 BOEM’s Five Year Program, detailed in section 2.2 of this document, includes
several comment periods during which the public and stakeholders can provide
input on the proposal, and provides for coordination of input from multiple
federal agencies and state, local, and tribal governments.
 In the case of FERC, plans can have a pertinent place under section 10(a)(2)(A) of
the FPA. That section requires the FERC to consider the extent to which a project
is consistent with federal and state comprehensive plans for improving,
developing, or conserving a waterway or waterways affected by the project. If an
ocean plan meets the requirements to be recognized as a comprehensive plan
under the FPA and provides information with enough specificity to apply to site-
specific decisions, the plan will receive the status of review required under the
FPA. In fact, portions of the marine spatial plans developed by Rhode Island and
Oregon have been accepted by the FERC as comprehensive plans, pursuant to
section 10(a)(2)(A) of the FPA.
State, regional, and federal bodies have carried out planning for coordination of ocean
uses through marine spatial planning. While the initial focus of several of these efforts
had not considered submarine telecom cables in planning, telecom industry voices have
been present to ensure submarine cables are included in the ocean planning processes.
State Level. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Oregon led the effort among the states.
The state efforts involved an extensive public process to establish state priorities. They
also involved aggressive gathering of information to inform the development of the plans.
Much of the data existed, with a smaller amount of new data collected. Much of the data
was in the form of maps or could be represented on maps. All three of these leading
states in marine spatial planning incorporated ocean-based infrastructure into their
mapping data, including specific maps of submarine cables. The states are using the data
to bolster their Coastal Zone Management Plans under the CZMA. With specific
exceptions, all federal actions and authorizations must be deemed consistent with the
state’s coastal zone management program.
Regional Level. At the regional level, groups of states have formed regional planning
entities to carry out ocean planning across state boundaries. Examples include the Mid-
Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (“MARCO”), Northeast Regional Ocean Council
41(“NROC”), West Coast Governors' Alliance on Ocean Health, and the Gulf of Mexico
Alliance. These entities have compiled regional ocean data, fostered cooperative
planning efforts, delivered education and outreach, and provided funding for planning-
related projects.
National Ocean Policy and Regional Planning Bodies. Issued as Executive Order
13547 in 2010, the President’s Ocean Policy called for the formation of regionally
focused Regional Planning Bodies (“RPB”) to better manage the nation’s oceans and
coasts. To carry out this significant endeavor, the area of ocean under United States
authority was divided into nine regions, each to have a RPB of government officials. In
the Northeast (http://neoceanplanning.org/about/northeast-rpb/ established November
2012) and the Mid-Atlantic (http://www.boem.gov/Mid-Atlantic-Regional-Planning-
Body/ established April 2013), the RPB regions overlap NROC and MARCO
respectively. The Northeast region also includes two of the three states with the most
thorough state-level marine spatial plans. In these regions, the RPBs and regional entities
are working together closely and are farther along in the process than elsewhere.
The RPBs comprise State, Federal, Tribal, and Fishery Management Council
representative that include BOEM, NOAA, U.S. Navy, UGCG, EPA, Natural Resources
Conservation Service, Department of Energy, and Maritime Administration. Although
the ACOE is not a formal member of the RPBs at this writing, it is the lead agency for
permits of telecom cable routes.
The RPBs have been working to define their mission and role in the ocean planning
process after having held a number of public meetings to discuss the process and define
work products. For the Mid Atlantic RPB, a facilitation team is helping to coordinate the
meetings and assist with preparation of the region's Ocean Action Plan. An important role
of the RPBs is to act as a forum for engaging stakeholders and the public on the range of
ocean uses and resources. This has been successful in that a number of not-for- profit
groups (Surf Rider Foundation and others), commercial and recreational fishers,
recreational boaters, industry shipping companies and telecom owners and installation
companies have been able to have input into the process.
It should be noted that the RPBs are not regulatory bodies; they do not create new
regulations, laws, authorities, or missions. RPBs may create regional ocean plans,
information exchange, and coordination processes to help inform and guide decision-
making under existing agency authorities. So it is left to the existing agencies (ACOE in
the case of granting federal permits for telecom cables) to review permit applications,
consult with agencies such as NOAA and FWS and others to rule on a telecom cable
permit and set conditions (if appropriate) for its route and installation methods.
Although, there is optimism that the RPB will act as a resource and coordination body
such that the cognizant agencies can make use of prepared studies to make informed
decisions on impacts and act in an efficient manner.
Aside from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic ocean data portals that comprise layers of
seabed infrastructure and uses and the RPBs’ intention to use this data in their agencies'
42decision-making, there does not appear to be a plan for the RPBs themselves to act as
vetting organizations for new ocean uses or for future ocean planning per se. However,
the website of the Northeast RPB states, “The RPB has no authority to create new
regulations. Its mandate is to create a plan and oversee its implementation, with many
opportunities for public participation.”
Regional ocean planning is intended to improve decision-making by helping individual
agencies exercise existing authorities in a more informed, coordinated, and efficient
manner. The RPBs' mandate is to create an ocean action plan and oversee its
implementation, with many opportunities for stakeholder engagement and public
participation. The financial resources needed to stand up and staff the RPB, as well as
carry out the necessary data development and analysis efforts and stakeholder
engagement, have been funded both by agencies and foundations. The RPBs leveraged
State and Federal funding through agency in-kind support, existing federally-funded
marine survey and scientific work, and inter-agency coordination.
Plans, by definition, are intended to support future decisions. The plans being developed
by the states, regional bodies, and RPBs will provide significant amounts of data, records
of stakeholder interests and opinions, and better understanding of agency roles, all of
which will support decisions about competing uses of the ocean, including for
infrastructure projects. Through these planning efforts, submarine cable data has been
collected and easily placed in the context of many other ocean uses. Siting a specific
infrastructure project, however, requires site-specific data. While the planning data
probably will lower the burden of gathering site-specific data for each impacted or
regulating agency, the need is likely to persist when the details of a development project
are presented.
NASCA is a non-profit organization of companies that own, install or maintain
submarine telecommunications cables in the waters of North America. NASCA serves as
a forum for its membership to provide and exchange information on technical, legal, and
policy issues of common interest. These issues include standards and procedures for
government approval of new cable installations; working relationships with other marine
industries; and public education about such cables. NASCA was formed in October
2000.
NASCA, and its seventeen members, are pleased to unveil member submarine telecom
cable system routes now available at the NASCA website at http://www.n-a-s-c-
a.org/cable-maps/ for online viewing or downloading in PDF format. NASCA has taken
this major step forward to further ensure the safety and continued operations of
submarine telecom cable systems which have been designated critical infrastructure for
both economic and security reasons. NASCA cable charts provide the interested
stakeholder the ability to assess the proximity of submarine cable systems to any planned
coastal projects or infrastructure buildout, and to request further information if required.
43Cable routes are overlaid onto NOAA Charts for those residing in United States waters,
and on equivalent charts for those outside of the United States.
Evaluation and Recommendations
Recommendations
Given the economic and national security importance of submarine cables, the continuing
need to ensure submarine cable protection in light of the risks posed to submarine cables
by other marine and coastal activities, the complex and diffuse regulation of such marine
and coastal activities, and gaps in understanding and coordination among government
agencies involved in such regulation, CSRIC V makes the following recommendations to
improve interagency and interjurisdictional coordination.54
1. Single Federal Point of Contact and Clearinghouse for Submarine Cables:
The FCC should establish—most likely within the FCC International Bureau—a
single federal point of contact and an information clearinghouse for submarine
telecommunications cables. The point of contact would provide a centralized and
initial point of contact for other federal, state, and local government agencies,
tribal organizations, and private parties seeking information regarding submarine
cables. The clearinghouse would provide information about existing and planned
submarine cables landing in the United States and its territories. It should also
provide other information about submarine cables, including but not limited to:
installation and repair methods; spatial requirements for installation, repair, and
infrastructure protection; federal laws prohibiting negligent and willful damage to
cables; limitations on commercial fishing activities in the proximity to submarine
cable-related activities; and the economic and national security importance of
submarine cables. The FCC should also encourage industry to share data
regarding existing submarine cables and planned submarine cables (to the extent
plans have otherwise been publicly disclosed). The FCC should make
information about the point of contact (whether an individual or office) and
clearinghouse resources available on its web site and encourage other government
agencies and private parties to link to that information to promote awareness and
use of those resources.
2. Encourage Timely Information Exchanges and Investigations to Identify
Potential Spatial Conflicts with Existing Submarine Cable Infrastructure:
The FCC should coordinate and cooperate with other governmental agencies
issuing permits and licenses for other marine and coastal activities—including but
not limited to BOEM (offshore oil and gas, offshore wind, and marine minerals),
Corps of Engineers (infrastructure in navigable waters, sand and gravel dredging,
54 These recommendations do not address the continuing need to improve coordination and streamlining
relating to Team Telecom’s national security reviews of submarine cable-related applications filed
with the FCC, as such coordination issues are somewhat separate from the marine spatial planning-
related issues addressed in this report. Nevertheless, such issues still require consideration and
analysis.
44and beach replenishment), the Department of Defense (military activities), FERC
(MHK projects), and NOAA (commercial fishing and National Marine
Sanctuaries)—to encourage those agencies to: (1) notify the FCC at the earliest
possible stage regarding planned activities and programs that could affect
installed submarine cables and seek feedback from the FCC regarding potential
conflicts (2) identify existing mechanisms, and develop and/or revise rules and
forms where necessary, to require permit applicants seeking authority for
particular marine and coastal activities to identify submarine cables that the
applicants’ activities could affect and consult with owners of those cables; and (3)
promote and use the FCC’s single point of contact and clearinghouse as a
resource for identifying installed and planned submarine cable infrastructure.
3. Proactive Participation in Marine Spatial Planning Activities: The FCC
should take an active role in marine spatial planning activities conducted by other
government agencies and interagency and interjurisdictional bodies to ensure
protection for existing and planned submarine cable infrastructure and to
minimize potential foreclosure of particular submarine cable routes and landings
and impairment of telecommunications network resilience. For example, the FCC
should participate in Corps of Engineers scoping processes both for new
submarine cables and for other marine and coastal projects. The FCC should
participate, when invited, in BOEM’s intergovernmental task forces and as a
cooperating agency during BOEM NEPA reviews. The FCC should also seek to
participate in NOAA proceedings to create new national marine sanctuaries or
expand the boundaries of existing sanctuaries.
4. Participation in National Ocean Council and Regional Planning Bodies: The
FCC should enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the CEQ in order to
participate in the National Ocean Council and Regional Planning Bodies. As an
independent regulatory agency, such a MOU could follow the model of FERC’s
MOU.
5. Development of Guidance for Regulatory Reviews for New Submarine Cable
Construction: In consultation with other government agencies, the FCC should
develop guidance regarding permitting of submarine cables similar to the
interagency (DOT, Corps, USCG, EPA, FWS, NOAA) Red Book. The FCC
should serve as the coordinating federal agency for submarine cables and seek to
synchronize regulatory reviews for submarine cables.
6. Use GIS for Marine Spatial Planning: FCC staff associated with point-of-
contact and clearinghouse functions should develop familiarity with geospatial
information systems (“GIS”) and use GIS in submarine cable-related activities.
The FCC should develop and maintain a database of existing and proposed
submarine cable routes and landings, leveraging existing resources already
available from NASCA and NOAA, in order to create a comprehensive resource
documenting all existing and planned submarine cables landing in the United
States and its territories. Through spatial analysis of cables and other activities
45(e.g., wind energy planning areas, potential sand and gravel borrow areas, etc.),
the FCC will be in a much better position to assist in deconflicting proposed cable
routes and landings and to coordinate protection of existing cables from risks of
damage posed by other marine and coastal activities. This central system for
identification and location of existing infrastructure could be referred to by ACOE
Districts when evaluating projects for 404/10 or 408 permitting, and by other
agencies.
7. Improved Data Management and Accessibility: The FCC should encourage
better management of spatial data by all government agencies involved in
authorizing marine and coastal projects. Agencies should be encouraged to use
the existing Marine Cadastre55 for planning projects and to require all project
applicants to use the same for both discovery of existing uses and capturing the
spatial requirements of planned projects. The FCC should encourage the Corps of
Engineers to require prompt provision of as-built cable data to NOAA for
charting. The FCC should also explore with other government agencies how to
improve access to and understanding of submarine cable location data,
particularly for audiences that may be unfamiliar with submarine cables and/or
lack a reason to search for such information.
8. Streamline Permitting Requirements: The FCC should work with other
federal, state and local agencies, and tribal organizations to streamline existing
permitting requirements and minimize burdens and timeframes for additional
coordination and infrastructure protection activities. For a new submarine cable
system, the combined permitting processes can already extend up to two years,
delaying and rendering more expensive the deployment of new connectivity.
Without a renewed focus on streamlining and elimination of duplicative
requirements, additional coordination activities could otherwise result in longer
permitting times for new cable installations, maintenance, or repairs.
9. Evaluate the Role of NEPA and other Relevant Statutes: The FCC should
work with other government agencies to identify situations in which NEPA is
used to identify potential conflicts between existing/ and planned submarine cable
activities and other marine and coastal activities, to understand the limitations of
NEPA as an infrastructure protection tool, and to consider other potential sources
of statutory authority for identification of submarine cable infrastructure in
permitting processes for other marine and coastal activities.
10. Liaison with DHS re Critical Infrastructure Protection: The FCC should
liaise with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which serves as the lead
agency for critical infrastructure protection in the telecommunications sector, to
coordinate submarine cable protection efforts and highlight the FCC’s single point
of contact and clearinghouse.
