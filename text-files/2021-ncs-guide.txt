Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition 
Joint forewordOver the last two decades, people worldwide have benefitted from the growth 
and adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and 
associated socio-economic and political opportunities. Digital transformation 
can be a powerful enabler of inclusive and sustainable development, but only 
if the underlying infrastructure and services that depend on it are safe, secure, 
and resilient. To reap the benefits and manage the challenges of digitalization, 
countries need to frame the proliferation of ICT-enabled infrastructures and 
services within a comprehensive national cybersecurity strategy.
To help governments in this endeavour, a consortium of partner organisations 
jointly developed and published the first Guide to Developing a National 
Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) in 2018. Since then, the number of national 
cybersecurity strategies or frameworks worldwide has increased significantly.  
In 2018, only 76 countries had adopted a strategy while today more than 127 
countries have such strategies in place, and many have used the Guide as a 
reference and blueprint.1
However, the fast-changing nature of cyberspace, the increased dependency 
on ICT, and the proliferation of digital risks all call for continuous improvements 
to national cybersecurity strategies. Most countries have both accelerated 
their digital transformation and become increasingly concerned about the 
immediate and future threats to their critical services, infrastructures, sectors, 
institutions, and businesses, as well as to international peace and security, that 
could result from the misuse of digital technologies and inadequate resilience.
This second edition of the Guide could not come at a more critical time. The 
updated content reflects the complex and evolving nature of cyberspace, as 
well as the main trends that can impact cybersecurity and should, therefore, 
be included into national strategic planning. The objective of the Guide is 
to instigate strategic thinking and continue supporting national leaders and 
policy-makers in the ongoing development, establishment, and implementation 
of such national cybersecurity strategies and policies. We are confident 
that this new Guide will serve as a useful tool for all stakeholders with 
cybersecurity responsibilities. 
As in the previous edition, this Guide is the result of a unique, collaborative, 
and equitable multi-stakeholder cooperation effort among partners working 
in the field of national cybersecurity strategies, policies, and cyber capacity-
building. Twenty expert organisations from the public and private sectors, as 
well as academia and civil society, shared their experience, knowledge, and 
expertise to produce this updated Guide, which draws from existing know-how 
from the participating organisations, as well as references to complementary 
publications and other available resources.
We would like to express our gratitude to the partners involved for their 
invaluable support and commitment in making this project a great achievement 
as a concrete example of a successful multistakeholder collaboration. We want 
to encourage this partnership to continue to collaborate and we look forward 
to working even more closely with governments, regional and international

Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition 
PrefaceThe Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy is one of the 
most comprehensive overviews of what constitute successful cybersecurity 
strategies. It is the result of a unique, collaborative, and equitable multi-
stakeholder effort. 
The partners came together with an appreciation of the need to strengthen 
cooperation and coordination across the international community on 
cybersecurity capacity-building.  The objective of this effort is to support 
national leaders and policymakers in the development of defensive and 
proactive responses to cyber risks, in the form of a National Cybersecurity 
Strategy, and in thinking strategically about cybersecurity, cyber-
preparedness, response and resilience, and building confidence and security in 
the use of ICTs.
The Guide was developed through an iterative approach, which sought to 
reach agreement through consensus-building. It is based on existing resources 
and aims to facilitate its use by national stakeholders. Wherever possible, the 
relevant sources and tools used to develop each set of recommendations are 
listed in the Reference section to encourage their broader use.
Cybersecurity is a foundational element underpinning the achievement 
of socio-economic objectives of modern economies. The hope is that 
this second edition of the Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity 
Strategy can continue to serve as a useful tool for all stakeholders involved 
in the development and implementation of this type of official document, 
including national policymakers, legislators, and regulators with cybersecurity 
responsibilities. In addition, it might have broader applicability, as the concepts 
introduced can be applied at the regional or municipal levels, as well as 
adapted for industry or used for academic research.
Note to readers 
on the updateVersion 2 of the Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 
updates, refines, clarifies, and expands on Version 1, which was published 
in 2018.  Since then, the cyber risk landscape has evolved and become 
increasingly more complex, and this iteration attempts to capture the main 
cybersecurity trends that should be taken into consideration in the national 
strategic planning. While Version 2 expands and enhances the content of 
version 1, it does not change the structure of the Guide nor the level of detail. 
Compatibility with version 1 has been an explicit objective of this revision. The 
updates made can be summarized as follows:
• Importance of funding with intent and investing in necessary resources: 
more detailed language has been incorporated to emphasize the need  
to invest in the necessary economic, human, and organisational resources 
for the full lifecycle of the Strategy (development, implementation,  
and revision);
• Stakeholders involvement: this version reiterates the crucial role of the 
private sector and civil society in the processes of incident response and 
management, information sharing, and awareness raising both domestically 
and abroad.  Also, more emphasis is given to the role that international 
stakeholders can play in the development and implementation of a 
national cybersecurity strategy. There are a wide variety of international 5
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition 
organisations, non-governmental organisations, and multilateral 
organisations that specialise in supporting national governments;
• Resilience and interdependencies: the updated content stresses 
the importance of considering a country’s internet-infrastructure 
entanglements and the resulting dependencies and vulnerabilities, 
the interconnections and interdependencies across sectors, and other 
supply chain risks. It provides more detailed good practices to encourage 
cooperation among different stakeholders to address increasing risks and 
improve resilience in the face of the expanding threat landscape; 
• Multidisciplinary approach to cyber capacity building: this version of the 
Guide recognises that cybersecurity applies to all verticals of society, and 
provides more detailed recommendations to develop capacity building 
activities that are inclusive and multidisciplinary, including policy, law 
enforcement, education, awareness, and diplomacy efforts; 
• Legislation, regulation, and human rights: this version has significantly 
expanded the coverage of good practices relating to the development of 
domestic cybersecurity and cybercrime legislation and regulation, and on 
the safeguarding of human rights and liberties.
• International cooperation: the updated Guide further emphasises the 
areas that a Strategy could cover in terms of cybersecurity cooperation 
and engagement at the regional and international levels, including on 
international trade agreements, regional economic partnerships, and 
voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. It stresses 
the importance of international law enforcement cooperation and formal 
or informal mechanisms to share information, build trust, and support 
cross-border cooperation in combating cybercrime and other cyber-
enabled crimes.6

1.1
PurposeThe purpose of this document is to guide national leaders and policy-makers 
in the development of a National Cybersecurity Strategy, and in thinking 
strategically about cybersecurity, cyber preparedness and resilience.
This Guide aims to provide a useful, flexible and user-friendly framework to 
set the context of a country’s socio-economic vision and current security 
posture and to assist policy-makers in the development of a Strategy that  
takes into consideration a country’s specific situation, cultural and societal 
values, and that encourages the pursuit of secure, resilient, ICT-enhanced and 
connected societies.
The Guide is a unique resource, as it provides a framework that has been 
agreed on by organisations with demonstrated and diverse experience in this 
topic area and builds on their prior work in this space. As such, it offers the 
most comprehensive overview to date of what constitutes successful national 
cybersecurity strategies.
Cybersecurity is a complex challenge that encompasses multiple different 
governance, policy, operational, technical and legal aspects. This Guide 
attempts to address, organise, and prioritise many of these areas based on 
existing and well-recognised models, frameworks and other references.
The Guide focuses on protecting civilian aspects of cyberspace and as such, 
it highlights the overarching principles and good practice that need to be 
considered in the process of drafting, developing and managing a National 
Cybersecurity Strategy.
To this end, the Guide makes a clear distinction between the “process” that 
will be adopted by countries during the lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity 
Strategy (initiation, stocktaking and analysis, production, implementation, 
reviews) and the “content”, the actual text that would appear in a National 
Cybersecurity Strategy document. The Guide does not cover aspects such as 
the development of defensive or offensive cyber-capabilities by a country’s 
military, defence forces, or intelligence agencies, even though a number of 
countries have been developing such capabilities.
In order to provide direction and good practice on “what” should be included in 
a National Cybersecurity Strategy, as well as on “how” to build, implement and 
review it, this Guide addresses both elements.
The Guide also provides an overview of the core components of what it takes 
for a country to become cyber-prepared, highlighting the critical aspects that 
governments should consider when developing their national strategies and 
implementation plans.
Finally, this Guide offers policy-makers a holistic, high-level overview of existing 
approaches and applications, and a reference to additional and complementary 
resources that can inform specific national cybersecurity efforts.1.2

1.3
Overall structure 
and usage of the 
GuideThis Guide has primarily been structured as a resource to help government 
stakeholders in preparing, drafting and managing their National Cybersecurity 
Strategy. As such, the content is organised to follow the process and order of a 
Strategy development:
• Section 2 – Introduction: provides an overview of the subject of the Guide 
with related definitions
• Section 3  – Strategy development lifecycle: details the steps in the 
development of a Strategy and its management during its full lifecycle;
• Section 4 – Overarching principles for a Strategy: outlines the cross-
cutting, fundamental considerations to be considered during the 
development of a Strategy;
• Section 5  – Focus areas and good practices: identifies the key elements 
and topics that should be considered during the development of a 
Strategy; and
• Section 6  – Supporting reference materials: provides further pointers  
to relevant literature that stakeholders can review as part of their  
drafting effort.
In particular, Section 3 addresses the process and aspects related to the 
development of a National Cybersecurity Strategy (such as preparation, 
drafting, implementation and long-term sustainability), while Sections 4 and 5 
are more focused on the content of a National Cybersecurity Strategy, as they 
highlight concepts and elements that the document should contain.
This Guide is first and foremost targeted at policy-makers responsible for 
developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy. The secondary audience are 
all other public and private stakeholders involved in the development and 
implementation of a Strategy, such as responsible government staff, regulatory 
authorities, law enforcement, ICT providers, critical infrastructure operators, 
civil society, academia, and research institutions. The Guide could also 
prove useful to the different stakeholders in the international development 
community that provide assistance in cybersecurity.1.4

Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition2 – INTRODUCTION
Since its creation, Information and Communication 
Technology has evolved to become the backbone 
of modern business, critical services and 
infrastructure, social networks, and the global 
economy as a whole. 
As a result, national leaders have started to launch digital strategies and to 
fund projects that increase Internet connectivity and leverage the benefits 
stemming from the use of ICTs, to stimulate economic growth, to increase 
productivity and efficiency, to improve service delivery and capacity, to 
provide access to business and information, to enable e-learning, to enhance 
workforce skills and to promote good governance. Countries cannot ignore the 
opportunities associated with becoming connected and participating in the 
Internet economy.
While the reliance of our societies on the digital infrastructure is growing, 
technology remains inherently vulnerable. The confidentiality, integrity 
and availability of ICT infrastructure are challenged by rapidly evolving 
risks, including electronic fraud, theft of intellectual property and personal 
identifiable information, disruption of service, and damage or destruction of 
property. The transformational power of ICTs and the Internet as catalysts for 
economic growth and social development are at a critical point where citizens’ 
and national trust and confidence in the use of ICTs are being eroded by 
cyber-insecurity.
To fully realise the potential of technology, states must align their national 
economic visions with their national security priorities. If the security risks 
associated with the proliferation of ICT-enabled infrastructure and Internet 
applications are not appropriately balanced with comprehensive national 
cybersecurity strategies and resilience plans, countries will be unable to 
achieve the economic growth and the national security goals they are seeking.
In response, nations are developing both offensive and defensive capabilities 
to defend themselves from illicit and illegal activities in cyberspace and to 
pre-empt incidents before they can cause harm to their nations. This document 
will look specifically at defensive responses, particularly in the form of national 
cybersecurity strategies.
Several national and international definitions of the term “cybersecurity” 
exist. For the purpose of this document, the term “cybersecurity” is meant 
to describe the collection of tools, policies, guidelines, risk management 
approaches,  actions, trainings, best practices, assurance, and technologies 
that can be used to protect the availability, integrity, and confidentiality 
of assets in the connected infrastructures pertaining to government, 
private organisations, and citizens; these assets include connected 
computing devices, personnel, infrastructure, applications, digital services, 
telecommunications systems, and data in the digital-environment.2.1
What is 
cybersecurity13
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition2 – INTRODUCTION
National cybersecurity strategies can take many forms and can go into varying 
levels of detail, depending on the particular country’s objectives and levels 
of cyber-readiness. Therefore, there is no established and commonly agreed 
definition of what constitutes a National Cybersecurity Strategy.
Relying on existing research in this area, this document encourages 
stakeholders to think of a National Cybersecurity Strategy as:
• an expression of the vision, high-level objectives, principles and priorities 
that guide a country in addressing cybersecurity;
• an overview of the stakeholders tasked with improving cybersecurity of 
the nation and their respective roles and responsibilities; and;
• a description of the steps, programmes and initiatives that a country will 
undertake to protect its national cyber-infrastructure and, in the process, 
increase its security and resilience.
Setting the vision, objectives, and priorities upfront enables governments 
to look at cybersecurity holistically across their national digital ecosystem, 
instead of at a particular sector, objective, or in response to a specific risk – it 
allows them to be strategic. Priorities for national cybersecurity strategies 
vary by country, so while the focus for one country may be addressing 
critical infrastructure-related risks, for others it may be protecting intellectual 
property, promoting trust in the online environment, or improving cybersecurity 
awareness of the general public or a combination of these issues.
The need to identify and subsequently prioritise investments and resources  
is critical to successfully managing risks in an area as all-encompassing  
as cybersecurity.
A National Cybersecurity Strategy also provides the opportunity to align 
cybersecurity priorities with other ICT-related objectives. Cybersecurity 
is central to achieving socio-economic objectives of modern economies 
and the Strategy should reflect how those are supported. This can be done 
by referencing existing policies that seek to implement a country’s digital 
or developmental agendas or by assessing how cybersecurity can be 
incorporated into them.
Finally, a National Cybersecurity Strategy development process should 
translate a government’s vision into coherent and implementable policies that 
will help it achieve its objectives. This includes not only the steps, programmes 
and initiatives that should be put in place, but also the resources allocated for 
those efforts and how these resources should be used. Similarly, the process 
should identify the metrics that will be used to help ensure that desired 
outcomes are achieved within set budgets and timelines.

This Section provides an overview of the various 
phases in the development of a Strategy, which 
include:
• Phase I – Initiation
• Phase II – Stocktaking and analysis
• Phase III – Production
• Phase IV – Implementation
• Phase V – Monitoring and evaluation
This Section also introduces the key entities that should be involved in the 
development of the Strategy and highlights other relevant stakeholders that 
could contribute to the process.
This Section ultimately aims to provide the reader with an understanding of 
the steps to be taken by a nation in order to draft a National Strategy and the 
possible mechanisms for its implementation according to the nation’s specific 
needs and requirements, integrating the overarching principles (described in 
Section 4) and good practice (described in Section 5).
This lifecycle, as illustrated in Figure 1, guides users of this document in 
focusing on strategic thinking about cybersecurity at the national level.
In accordance with Sections 4 and 5 of this document, the initiation phase of 
a National Cybersecurity Strategy provides the foundations for its efficient 
development. This phase is expected to focus on processes, timelines, and 
identification of key stakeholders who should be involved in the production 
of the Strategy. The outcome of this phase is the elaboration of a plan for the 
development of the Strategy. When foreseen by the country’s governance 
process, the plan may require the approval of the country’s Executive. 
3.1.1 Identifying the Lead Project Authority
In line with the principle of defining clear leadership, roles, and resource 
allocation (Section 4.8), the Strategy development process should be 
coordinated by a single, competent authority. The Executive should appoint an 
either pre-existing or newly created public entity, such as a ministry, agency, 
or a department, to lead the development of the Strategy. This entity, referred 
to in this document as the Lead Project Authority, should in turn, appoint 
an individual or team responsible and accountable for leading the Strategy 
development process.
The Lead Project Authority should be neutral throughout the development 
process. To this end, it is recommended that this entity be different from the 
one(s) that will be responsible for the implementation of the Strategy. This or 3.1

other mechanisms should be adopted to overcome any inherent bias and help 
avoid intra-governmental competition for resources.
3.1.2 Establishing a Steering Committee
The Executive should also establish a Steering Committee to work with the 
Lead Project Authority in developing the Strategy. It should be empowered 
to provide guidance, as well as play a role in quality assurance. In addition, 
it should guarantee the transparency and inclusiveness of the process, 
in accordance with the principle on clear leadership, roles, and resource 
allocation (Section 4.8). The Steering Committee’s role, set-up, and 
membership should be clearly defined from the outset.
As the Steering Committee may need to review sensitive documents, it should 
be constituted accordingly. It is also important that its membership reflects 
the various responsibilities given to this body, for instance through seniority 
of appointments.

3.1.3 Identifying stakeholders to be involved in the development of  
the Strategy
In this step, the Lead Project Authority should identify an initial set of 
stakeholders to be involved in the development of the Strategy. It should 
also clarify the roles of the different stakeholders and outline how they will 
collaborate in order to manage expectations throughout the process.
Throughout the process, the Lead Project Authority may need to reach out 
to additional stakeholders to leverage all pertinent knowledge and expertise. 
This would embrace the principle of inclusiveness (Section 4.3), which 
highlights the importance of cooperation with a range of stakeholders across 
government, the private sector, and civil society. For example, the Lead Project 
Authority could consider including ICT companies, critical-infrastructure 
operators, academic experts, and non-governmental organisations working on 
raising cybersecurity awareness and preparedness, amongst others.
For such cooperation mechanism, the Lead Project Authority could establish 
an Advisory Committee, that would contribute in designating members to serve 
on the Steering Committee, as well as consulting on the various phases of the 
Strategy development. Whenever possible its composition should be wide 
enough to include representation from all the sectors of the society that are 
going to be impacted by the Strategy.
In addition, the Lead Project Authority, with advice from the Steering 
Committee, could consider involving international stakeholders to get extra 
support or expertise. There are a wide variety of international organisations, 
non-governmental organisations, and private entities that specialise in 
supporting national governments in their NCS activities. 
3.1.4 identifying human and financial resources
In this step, the Lead Project Authority should identify the human and financial 
resources needed to develop and implement the strategy, and where these 
could be procured. For example, required expertise could be solicited from 
intergovernmental organisations, the private sector, civil society, academia, or 
development agencies. Similarly, funding requirements might be addressed 
through reallocation of dedicated funding streams in existing budgets, or through 
new funding available from third parties (e.g., international organisations).
Particular attention should be placed on securing long-term funding for the 
full lifecycle of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, including its development, 
implementation, and refinement. For further details on the allocation of resources 
for the implementation, please see “Allocating human and financial resources for 
the implementation” (Section 3.4.3), and for further details on long-term funding, 
please see “Allocate dedicated budget and resources” (Section 5.1.5).
3.1.5 Planning the development of the Strategy
In the final step of the Initiation phase, the Lead Project Authority should 
prepare a plan for developing the National Cybersecurity Strategy. Once the 
plan has been drafted, it should be submitted, as applicable, to the Steering 20
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition3 – LIFECYCLE OF A NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY
3.2
Phase II: 
Stocktaking and 
analysisCommittee and the Executive, for approval, in accordance with the national 
governance processes.
In drafting the plan, the Lead Project Authority should also consider whether 
the National Cybersecurity Strategy will take the form of legislation or policy, 
as different options might influence the formal processes that would need to 
be followed, as well as the timeframe for adoption.
The Strategy development plan should identify the major steps and activities, 
key stakeholders, timelines, and resource requirements including human  
and financial. It should specify how and when relevant stakeholders will  
be expected to participate in the development process to contribute input 
and feedback.
Figure 2 shows possible interactions and distribution of roles between different 
stakeholders and committees.
Further references available on page 56.
The purpose of this phase is to collect data to assess the national 
cybersecurity landscape and the current and future cyber-related risks to 
inform the drafting and development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. 
The output of this exercise, conducted by or with the consult of the Advisory 
Committee, should be a report that provides an overview of the strategic 
national cybersecurity posture and risk landscapes to be submitted to the 
Steering Committee.
Before beginning the actual production (or updating) of the text of the 
Strategy, the Lead Project Authority should carefully analyse and assess the 
information gathered during the stocktaking phase to ensure that any gaps 
in cybersecurity capacity are identified and options for addressing them 
presented. The analysis should result in an assessment of how far the existing 
policy, regulatory, and operational environments meet the identified needs of 
the country and highlight where they fall short.
Similarly, it should be used to identify specific key issues, such as educational 
and training gaps.
Lastly, the analysis should result in an assessment of all relevant and desirable 
outcomes for the Strategy, as well as the necessary and available means that 
can be employed to reach the desired goals.
3.2.1 Assessing the national cybersecurity landscape
For the National Cybersecurity Strategy to be effective, it needs to reflect the 
cybersecurity posture of the country. To this end, an analysis of the country’s 
existing cybersecurity strengths and weaknesses should be conducted, and 
relevant materials and documents should be consulted in collaboration with 
relevant stakeholders across government, private sector, and civil society. This 
step should embrace the principle of comprehensive approach and tailored 21
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition3 – LIFECYCLE OF A NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY
priorities (described in Section 4.2). The Lead Project Authority, with support 
from the Advisory Committee, should also take stock of different stakeholders’ 
roles and responsibilities in the cybersecurity of the country in order to share 
effective practices and reduce overlaps.
As part of this effort, the Lead Project Authority should identify assets and 
services critical to the proper functioning of the society and economy, and 
map existing national laws, regulations, policies, programmes, and capacity as 
they relate to cybersecurity. The Lead Project Authority should also identify 
existing soft regulatory mechanisms, such as private-public partnerships, and 
take stock of capabilities that have been developed to address cybersecurity 
challenges, such as national Computer Emergency Response Teams, Computer 
Incident Response Teams or Computer Security Incident Response Teams 
(CERTs/CIRTs/CSIRTs). Moreover, the roles and responsibilities of existing 
public agencies with a cybersecurity mandate, such as regulators or data-
protection agencies, should be identified and mapped.
Additionally, related data that can inform the country’s cybersecurity posture 
should be collected. This could include: information on existing national 
cybersecurity programmes; international initiatives; multilateral and bilateral 
agreements; private sector projects; ICT and cyber-education and skill-
development programmes; cyber-R&D initiatives; data on Internet penetration 
and infection rates, ICT uptake, and technology developments; and insights on 
future ICT and cybersecurity trends and threats. 
Relevant information provided by the private sector, research institutions, 
and other stakeholder groups should be included in this analysis as well. For 
developing countries, it is also crucial to map out the collaborative initiatives 
with development partners to coordinate technical assistance  
and investments.
Finally, the Lead Project Authority should also investigate similar information 
at the regional and international levels, and examine sector-specific strategies 
and initiatives.
3.2.2 Assessing the cyber-risk landscape
Building on the information collected in the previous step, the Lead Project 
Authority should assess the risks the nation faces due to digital dependence. 
This can be achieved through the identification of national digital assets, both 
public and private, their interdependencies, vulnerabilities and threats, and an 
estimation of the likelihood and potential impact of a cyber-incident.
This effort embraces the principle of risk management and resilience (Section 
4.6), which recognises that risk management is critical to fully realising 
the benefits of the digital environment for socio-economic development. 
Furthermore, this initial risk assessment can form the basis for future, 
more specific risk assessments (further information on the Principle of Risk 
Management and Resilience and how to conduct risk assessments can be 
found in Section 5.2).
Further references available on page 56.22
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition3 – LIFECYCLE OF A NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY
The purpose of this phase is to develop the text of the Strategy by engaging 
key stakeholders from the public sector, private sector, and civil society 
through a series of public consultations and working groups. This broader 
group of stakeholders, coordinated by the Lead Project Authority, will be 
responsible for defining the overall vision and scope of the Strategy, setting 
high-level objectives, taking stock of the current situation (detailed in Phase II), 
prioritising objectives in terms of impact on society, citizens and the economy, 
and ensuring the necessary financial resources. As part of this phase, all the 
cross-cutting principles (Section 4) and good-practice elements (Section 5) 
detailed in this Guide should be considered.
3.3.1 Drafting the National Cybersecurity Strategy
Once the stocktaking and analysis phase is complete, the Lead Project 
Authority, in collaboration with the Steering Committee, should initiate the 
drafting of the Strategy. Dedicated working groups could be created either 
to focus on specific topics, or to draft different sections of the Strategy. The 
working groups should follow the processes established in the Initiation Phase, 
adjusting these as necessary.
The Strategy should provide the overall cybersecurity direction for the country; 
express a clear vision and scope; set objectives to be accomplished within 
a specific time frame; and prioritise these in terms of impact on society, the 
economy, and infrastructure. Moreover, it should identify possible courses of 
actions; incentivise implementation efforts; and drive the allocation of required 
resources to support all these activities. The Strategy may also include some of 
the findings developed in the Stocktaking and Analysis Phase.
Similar to the step dealing with planning the development of the Strategy, the 
actual document needs to put forward a clear governance framework (Section 
5.1) that defines the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders. This 
includes the identification of the entity responsible and accountable for the 
management and evaluation of the Strategy, as well as an entity responsible 
for its overall management and implementation, such as a central authority or a 
national cybersecurity council.
The Strategy also needs to define or confirm the mandate of the different 
entities involved in the national cybersecurity architecture of the country, 
including those responsible for: initiating and developing cybersecurity 
policies and regulations; collecting threat and vulnerability information; 
responding to cyber-incidents (e.g., national CERTs/CIRTs/CSIRTs); and 
strengthening preparedness and performing crisis management. It should also 
ensure that it is clear how all of these entities interact with each other and with 
the central authority.
3.3.2 Consulting with a broad range of national, regional and  
international stakeholders
As mentioned above, engaging stakeholders is crucial for the success of 
a Strategy. In order to ensure that the final Strategy is based on a shared 
vision, the draft document should be disseminated across a wide stakeholder 
group not limited to those who participated in the Strategy development 3.3
Phase III: 
Production of 
the National 
Cybersecurity 
Strategy23
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition3 – LIFECYCLE OF A NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY
process. This can happen through a variety of engagements, including 
online consultation, validation workshops, and additional working groups. 
International organisations and other external stakeholders can play a role in 
the consultation step by providing advice and expertise. It is expected that 
feedback and comments resulting from this process will be used to finalise 
the Strategy.
3.3.3 Seeking formal approva l
In the final step of the Strategy development, the Lead Project Authority 
should ensure that the Strategy is formally adopted by the Executive. This 
official adoption process will vary by country and be based on how the 
Strategy is defined in the legislative framework. For example, it could be 
adopted through a parliamentary procedure or a government decree.
Furthermore, it is pivotal that the Strategy is not only developed with approval 
from the highest levels of government, but that this commitment continues in 
its implementation phase. The relevant officials should be held accountable 
and be supported by both political capital and resources.
3.3.4 Publishing and promoting the Strategy
The Strategy should be a public document and should be made readily 
available. The launch of the Strategy should ideally be accompanied by 
internal and external promotion activities.  The broad availability of the 
strategy will both ensure that the general public is aware of the government’s 
cybersecurity priorities and objectives, and also support any effort to raise 
cybersecurity awareness. Should the Strategy be accompanied by an Action 
Plan, the latter should also indicate additional opportunities for further 
engagement and cooperation with civil society, the private sector, and 
international partners.
Further references available on page 57.
The Implementation phase is the most important element of the overall 
National Cybersecurity Strategy lifecycle. A structured approach to 
implementation, supported by adequate human and financial resources, is 
critical to the success of the Strategy and needs to be considered as part of 
its development. The implementation phase is frequently centred on an Action 
Plan, which guides the various activities envisioned.
3.4.1 Developing the action plan
As with the development of the Strategy, its implementation cannot be 
the sole responsibility of a single body or authority. Instead, it requires 
engagement and coordination of a range of different stakeholders across the 
government, as well as support from civil society and the private sector.  The 
Action Plan, developed in accordance with the principle of clear leadership, 
roles, and resource allocation (Section 4.8), can support the effective 
implementation of the Strategy.3.4
Phase IV: 
Implementation24
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition3 – LIFECYCLE OF A NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY
The development of the Action Plan is almost as important as the Plan itself. 
The process, orchestrated by the Lead Project Authority, should serve as a 
mechanism to bring the relevant stakeholders together to agree on objectives 
and outcomes, as well as coordinate efforts and pool resources.
3.4.2 Determining initiatives to be implemented
The National Cybersecurity Strategy highlights the government’s objectives 
and the outcomes they wish to realise across the different focus areas 
identified. In the Action Plan, the Lead Project Authority should – in 
coordination with relevant stakeholders – identify the specific initiatives 
within each focus area that will help meet those objectives. Examples of such 
initiatives could include organising cybersecurity exercises, establishing 
security baselines for critical infrastructures, and setting an incident reporting 
framework, amongst others.
The timeline and effort needed for the implementation of these initiatives 
should be prioritised in accordance with their criticality to ensure that limited 
resources are appropriately leveraged. To this end, results and outcomes of 
Phase II (Stocktaking and analysis) specifically with regards to “Assessing the 
cyber-risk landscape” (Section 3.2.2) might be considered.
3.4.3 Allocating human and financial resources for the implementation
Once the priority initiatives have been identified, the Lead Project Authority 
should identify specific government entities as owners for each of those 
initiatives. In turn, these government entities would be responsible and 
accountable for the implementation of each specific initiative assigned to them 
and be expected to coordinate their efforts with other relevant stakeholders as 
part of the implementation process.
To ensure these entities can deliver the expected outcomes, the Lead Project 
Authority should assess whether they have been given an appropriate 
mandate – legal or otherwise – required for the implementation. The Lead 
Project Authority should also work with the owners of the specific initiatives 
to understand what resources are required to accomplish the work. This 
assessment should incorporate human resources, expertise, and funding 
needs. The Lead Project Authority should then work with the owners to 
help them identify and secure the required resources in accordance with 
administrative financial structures of the country.
3.4.4 Setting timeframes and metrics
The final critical element of the Action Plan is the development of specific 
metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess each of the 
initiatives undertaken, such as whether the country conducted an awareness 
campaign on the importance of information sharing, organised and executed a 
cybersecurity exercise with critical infrastructure sector, or passed a security 
baseline law. Specific timelines for implementation should also be set.
The metrics and KPIs should be developed by the Lead Project Authority in 
partnership with the respective operators. The latter should be encouraged to 25
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition3 – LIFECYCLE OF A NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY
define and maintain a more detailed set of metrics to facilitate evaluations  
of the efficiency and effectiveness of the initiatives during and following  
their completion.
Further references available on page 57.
Developing and implementing the strategy is an ongoing process. A competent 
authority should devise a formal process to monitor and evaluate the Strategy. 
In the monitoring phase, the government should ensure that the Strategy is 
implemented in accordance with its Action Plan. In the evaluation phase, the 
government and the national competent authority should assess whether the 
Strategy is still relevant and current in light of the changing risk environment 
and whether it still reflects the government’s objectives and what adjustments 
are necessary. 
3.5.1 Establishing a formal process
To ensure effective monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of 
the Strategy, the government will have to identify an independent entity 
responsible for monitoring and evaluating the implementation progress 
and efficiency. The entity should ideally be involved in defining appropriate 
monitoring and evaluation metrics for the implementation of the Strategy and 
associated Action Plan and initiatives, which should take place during the 
Production and Initiation phases.
Monitoring and measuring the performance and successful execution of 
the implementation plan for the Strategy should be part of the governance 
mechanisms that a country puts in place. Continuous assessment of the 
implementation plan (i.e., what is going well and what is not) helps inform 
the Strategy. Good governance mechanisms with regards to the Strategy 
implementation should also clearly delineate the accountability and 
responsibility for ensuring successful execution. Establishing metrics or 
KPIs by near-term, mid-term, and long-term objectives helps reinforce the 
governance and management mechanisms. Key performance indicators or 
metrics should be SMARRT:
• Specific  – target a specific area for improvement and focus on the change 
that is expected.
• Measurable  – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
• Achievable  – state what results can realistically be achieved, given 
available resources.
• Relevant – focus on significant indicators of progress
• Responsible  – specify who will do it
• Time-related  – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.
The establishment of baseline metrics will enable better monitoring of actions 
and highlight areas of potential improvement. Furthermore, the allocation  
of budgets should match the levels of ambition and complexity of the  
desired impact.3.5
Phase V:  
Monitoring and 
evaluation26
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition3 – LIFECYCLE OF A NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY
3.5.2 Monitoring the progress of the implementation of the Strategy
The entity responsible for monitoring the progress of implementation of the 
Strategy should do so in accordance with an agreed upon timeline over the 
course of the entire lifecycle of the Strategy. The outcome of such monitoring 
activity (e.g., a report), should note any deviations from the agreed upon 
timelines and the reasons for any delays, such as priorities shifting, insufficient 
staffing or resources, etc. This should be done in addition to periodic updates 
by the owners of the different strands of the implementation of the Strategy 
to the Lead Project Authority. All relevant stakeholders should be actively 
involved in monitoring the implementation of the Strategy.
This approach will ensure that the relevant stakeholders are held 
accountable to the commitments set; it will also ensure that any challenges to 
implementation are identified early on. In turn, this would allow the government 
to either rectify the situation or adapt its plans accordingly based on the 
lessons learnt in the implementation process.
3.5.3 Evaluating the outcomes of the Strategy
In addition to assessing the progress across the agreed upon metrics, it is 
important to also periodically evaluate the outcomes and compare them with 
the objectives originally set. This is critical for understanding whether the 
objectives of the Strategy are being realised or whether different actions 
should be considered.
As part of this process, the broader risk environment also needs to be regularly 
re-evaluated to understand whether any external changes are affecting the 
outcomes of the Strategy. Effectively, this process acts as a light-touch revision 
of a country’s risk assessment profile.
The assessment, together with associated recommendations, should be 
compiled into a report for the Lead Project Authority, and include ways to 
update the Action Plan and ensure that it is current and responsive to the 
changing policy and the risk landscape.
Ultimately, the reports produced over the lifecycle of the Strategy should also 
form the basis for the overall review of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in 
accordance with the timeline set during the initiation phase. This overarching 
review should not only consider the progress made and the changes in the 
external environment, but also re-assess the government’s own priorities  
and objectives.

Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy
Overarching 
PrinciplesSection 428
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition4 – OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES
This Section presents nine cross-cutting principles, 
which taken together can help in the development 
of a forward-looking and holistic National 
Cybersecurity Strategy. 
These principles are applicable to all key focus areas identified in this 
document. They should be considered in all steps of a National Strategy 
development process, from the drafting of the National Strategy document to 
its implementation.
The order of these principles reflects a logical narrative rather than an order  
of importance.
The Strategy should set a clear whole-of-government and  
whole-of-society vision.
A Strategy is more likely to be successful when it sets a vision that helps all 
stakeholders understand what is at stake and why the Strategy is needed 
(context), what is to be accomplished (objectives), as well as what it is about 
and who it impacts (scope).
The clearer the vision, the easier it will be for leaders and key stakeholders 
to ensure a more comprehensive, consistent, and coherent approach. A 
clear vision also facilitates coordination, co-operation, and implementation 
of the Strategy amongst the relevant stakeholders. It should be formulated 
at a sufficiently high level and consider the dynamic nature of the digital 
environment.
The objectives and implementation timeline of the Strategy should be aligned 
with this vision.
Further references available on page 58.4.1
Vision
The Strategy should result from an all-encompassing understanding and 
analysis of the overall digital environment, yet be tailored to the country’s 
circumstances and priorities.
Cybersecurity is not only a technical challenge but a complex multi-faceted 
issue, with aspects extending beyond economic and social prosperity 
into areas such as law enforcement, national and international security, 
international relations, trade negotiations, and sustainable development.
It is important to understand all the aspects of cybersecurity and how they 
interrelate, potentially complementing or competing with each other. Based on 
this understanding and an analysis of the country’s specific context, priorities 
can then be defined in line with the objectives and implementation timeline of 
the Strategy. Priorities will allow for setting up specific objectives and timelines 
and to allocate the necessary resources.4.2
Comprehensive 
approach and 
tailored priorities29
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition4 – OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES
The priorities included in a National Cybersecurity Strategy will vary by 
country. Some of the cybersecurity topics can be addressed in the same or 
in separate strategic documents (e.g., digital aspects of national security and 
defence can be addressed within a national security or defence strategy).
Further references available on page 58.
The Strategy should be developed with the active participation of all the 
relevant stakeholders, and it should address their needs and responsibilities.
The digital environment has become critical to governments, organisations, 
and individuals. These groups face cybersecurity risks and share a level of 
responsibility in managing them, depending on their role. For this reason, 
it is advisable for governments to establish partnerships and collaboration 
mechanisms to include the private sector and civil society in cyber strategy 
negotiations and implementation.
While it may be a difficult task, identifying and meaningfully engaging all 
the relevant stakeholders is essential to the development and successful 
implementation of a National Cybersecurity Strategy. This will help understand 
stakeholder needs and their unique knowledge and expertise, thus facilitating 
cooperation towards achieving the objectives of the Strategy.
To foster inclusiveness and transparency, the Strategy should be a public 
document. Further references available on page 59.4.3
Inclusiveness
The Strategy should foster economic and social prosperity and maximise the 
contribution of ICT to sustainable development and social inclusiveness.
The digital environment has the potential to expedite economic growth and 
social progress, to advance key societal values, to improve public-service 
delivery and capacity, to facilitate international trade, and to promote  
good governance.
The increasing reliance on the digital environment for the functioning 
of societies demands increased attention on cybersecurity. However, 
cybersecurity is not a goal in itself; the Strategy should be aligned with the 
country’s broader socio-economic objectives and lead to building the trust and 
confidence necessary to both help realise these objectives as well as protect 
the country from cyber-threats.
Further references available on page 59.4.4
Economic and 
Social Prosperity
The Strategy should respect and be consistent with fundamental  
human rights.
The Strategy should recognise the fact that rights that people have 
offline must also be protected online. It should respect universally agreed 
fundamental human rights, including, but not limited to, the ones found in 
the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International 4.5
Fundamental 
human rights30
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition4 – OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as relevant multilateral or 
regional legal frameworks.
Attention should be paid to freedom of expression, privacy of communications, 
and personal data protection. In particular, the Strategy should avoid 
facilitating the practice of arbitrary, unjustified or otherwise unlawful 
surveillance, interception of communications, or processing of personal data.
In ensuring that the State is able to take action to meet its legitimate interests 
while still respecting individuals’ human rights, the Strategy should ensure that, 
where applicable, surveillance, interception of communications, and collection 
of data are conducted within the context of a specific investigation or legal 
case, authorised by the relevant national authority and on the basis of a public, 
precise, comprehensive, and non-discriminatory legal framework enabling 
effective oversight, procedural safeguards, and remedies.

The Strategy should enable an efficient management of cybersecurity risks 
and drive the resilience of the economic and social activities.
While the digital environment provides stakeholders with economic and 
social opportunities, it also exposes them to cybersecurity risk. For example, 
when organisations use ICT to foster innovation, gain productivity, and 
improve competitiveness, or when governments deploy their services online, 
cybersecurity incidents can occur, potentially resulting in financial loss, 
reputational damage, disruption of operations, physical impacts, undermining 
of innovation, etc. As with other types of risk, cybersecurity risk cannot be 
entirely eliminated but they can be managed and minimised.
To address that challenge, the Strategy should encourage entities to 
prioritise their cybersecurity investments and to proactively manage risk. 
Depending on an entity’s risk appetite, a balance has to be maintained 
between security measures and potential benefits, considering the dynamic 
nature of the digital environment. The Strategy should also recognise the 
need for continuous risk management and facilitate a coherent approach 
across interdependent entities.
The focus on risk management will also prepare stakeholders for potential 
security incidents and compromises, ensuring the resilience of economic 
and societal activity in the country. With that in mind, the Strategy should 
encourage the adoption of business-continuity and disaster recovery 
measures, which include incident and crisis management, as well as  
recovery plans.

Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition4 – OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES
The Strategy should utilise the most appropriate policy instruments  
available to realise each of its objectives, considering the country’s  
specific circumstances.
The government’s cybersecurity goals will only be achieved if a change in 
behaviour occurs across all stakeholders involved. In most cases, governments 
have different levers and policy instruments at their disposal to achieve that 
outcome. These include legislation, regulation, standardisation, certifications, 
incentives, information-sharing programmes and mechanisms, education 
programmes, sharing best-practice, setting expected norms of behaviour, and 
building communities of trust among others. Each of these has its own strengths 
and weaknesses, comes at differing cost, and brings different results.
The best results can be achieved by selecting the most appropriate policy 
instrument for each individual objective and balancing the use of different tools.
Further references available on page 62.
The Strategy should be set at the highest level of the government, which 
will then be responsible for assigning relevant roles and responsibilities and 
allocating sufficient human and financial resources.
Cybersecurity should be promoted and sustained at the highest levels of 
government. Moreover, to ensure accountability and progress, focal points of 
individual work streams need to be identified, and all parties involved should 
have a clear understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities.
The Strategy should also allocate the human, financial, and material resources 
necessary for its implementation. This principle needs to guide both the 
Strategy development process and the elaboration of the action plan for  
the Strategy.
Further references available on page 62.
The Strategy should help build a digital environment that citizens and 
organisations can trust .
Building trust in the national digital ecosystem, in which users’ rights and 
interests are protected and security of data and systems is assured, is 
essential to realise the full potential of the social, political, and economic 
opportunities offered by the use of ICTs. The Strategy must enable policies, 
processes, and actions at the national level in order to render secure critical 
services (including e-governance, e-commerce, digital financial transactions, 
tele-medicine, among others) supported by ICTs and utilised by citizens. Such 
course of actions would inculcate the principle of trust not only among the 
general population but also within those public and private organisations that 
will offer their ICT-related services to citizens.

Good PracticeSection 534
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
Cybersecurity affects many areas of socio-economic 
development and is influenced by several factors 
within the national context. 
Therefore, this Section introduces a set of good-practice elements that can 
make the Strategy comprehensive and effective, while allowing for tailoring to 
the national context.
These good-practice elements are grouped into distinct focus areas – 
effectively overarching themes for a National Cybersecurity Strategy. While 
both the focus areas and the good-practice elements have been put forward 
here as examples of good practice, it is particularly important that the 
latter are viewed in the national context, as some may not be relevant to a 
country’s specific situation. Countries should identify and follow the good-
practice elements that support their own objectives and priorities in line with 
the vision defined in their Strategy (Section 4). The order of the individual 
elements or focus areas below should not be seen as indicating a level of 
importance or priority.
This focus area introduces good-practice elements to consider for inclusion in 
the text of the Strategy when addressing the governance structure for national 
cybersecurity (including all entities with responsibilities and authorities for 
advancing the digital economy and reducing risk from cyber insecurity). The 
Strategy should clearly state the objectives and outcomes the government 
has for the country to increase its resilience and reduce risks to its companies, 
critical infrastructures, services, and assets. The Strategy should clearly 
identify the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders tasked with its 
implementation and introduce measures to hold authorities and officials 
accountable for the implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and outcome of 
the Strategy (see Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy ). 
To that end, the Strategy should identify and empower the competent authority 
accountable for the execution of the Strategy; establish a mechanism to 
identify and task the government entities affected by, or responsible for, 
the implementation of the Strategy; commit to include specific, measurable, 
attainable, result-based, and time-based objectives in the implementation plan 
for the Strategy; and recognise the need to commit resources (e.g., political 
will, funding, time, and people) to achieve the desired outcomes.
5.1.1 Ensure the highest level of support
The Strategy should have the formal endorsement of the highest level of 
government. This endorsement serves two important purposes. Firstly, it 
improves the likelihood that sufficient resources will be allocated and that 
coordination efforts will be successful. Secondly, it signals to the broader 
national ecosystem that the country’s cybersecurity is intertwined with its 
digital economy and other social and political aspects that depend on digital 
systems, and must be a national priority.5.1
Focus Area 1 - 
Governance35
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
The Strategy may also need to be codified in the domestic legal framework in 
order to obtain national relevance and prioritization.
5.1.2 Establish a competent cybersecurity authority
The Strategy should identify a dedicated national competent authority who 
has the responsibility for executing the Strategy.  This authority should be 
a leader (whether an individual or an entity) who is elevated and strongly 
anchored at the highest level of government to provide direction, to coordinate 
action, and to monitor the implementation of the Strategy.  The competent 
authority should also be responsible for reporting on the progress and 
outcome of the Strategy.
Such a national competent authority should also act as management entity 
to define and clarify roles, responsibilities, processes, decision rights, and 
the tasks required to ensure effective implementation of the Strategy. This 
includes identifying the stakeholders who will oversee the implementation 
of the Strategy and establishing performance targets for various ministerial 
or governmental departments, institutions, or individuals responsible for 
specific aspects of the Strategy and subsequent action plan. In some cases, 
the position of national competent authority for cybersecurity may have to be 
formalized in policy or law to empower it to perform its missions.
Given the fact that cybersecurity intersects many different issue areas, it 
is important to ensure that the national-competent authority has the ability 
to involve and direct relevant stakeholders. This too may require additional 
legislation that mandates government entities to report back to the national 
competent authority about their progress on achieving the Strategy’s 
outcomes in measurable terms. Using key performance indicators (KPIs) is an 
effective way to assess progress.
5.1.3 Ensure intra-governmental cooperation
The Strategy should establish a mechanism to identify and include the 
government entities affected by or responsible for its implementation. 
Intra-governmental commitment, coordination, and cooperation are core 
functions of those governmental institutions, needed to ensure that the 
governance mechanisms (e.g., standards, regulations, market incentives, etc.) 
and resources yield the desired outcomes of the Strategy. Having a well-
established and high-level national cybersecurity competent authority will also 
help enhance intra-government coordination and cooperation. 
Effective communication and coordination ensure that all ministries and 
government agencies are aware of each other’s respective authorities, 
missions, and tasks. Commitment, however, is about supporting consistent 
policies over time to ensure that promises in the Strategy are delivered. An 
example of a coordination mechanism would be conducting periodic meetings 
that involve all relevant stakeholders in the plans of actions that are to be 
jointly reviewed.  An example of a cooperation mechanism would be the 
creation of an intra-government task force to address a particular issue. An 
example of commitment is consistency between the country’s domestic and 
foreign policy agendas, so that one ministry does not undermine the credibility 36
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
of another by representing different positions on the same policy issue area 
(e.g., trade flow vs. export control of dual-use technologies).
5.1.4 Ensure inter-sectoral cooperation
The Strategy should reflect an understanding of the dependencies that the 
government has on the private sector and other national non-governmental 
stakeholders (and vice-versa) in achieving a more secure, safe, and resilient 
ecosystem (Principle of Inclusiveness). To this end, the Strategy should 
articulate how the government will engage these different stakeholders and 
define their roles and responsibilities. For example, the Strategy should identify 
a network of authoritative national contact points for critical industries that are 
essential for the operation and recovery of critical services and infrastructures.
The Strategy should be aligned with other national priorities, such as ensuring 
connectivity is affordable, available, and inclusive; advancing data protection 
and privacy while promoting innovation; strengthening infrastructures 
resilience and service availability to disasters, climate change, and pandemics; 
exploring new technologies like AI, blockchain, quantum computing; etc. 
(Principle 2 on “ Comprehensive Approach and Tailored Priorities ”). 
5.1.5 Allocate dedicated budget and resources
The Strategy should specify the allocation of dedicated and appropriate 
resources for its implementation, maintenance, and revision. Sufficient, 
consistent and continuous funding provides the foundations for an effective 
national cybersecurity posture.
Resources should be defined in terms of money (i.e., dedicated budget), 
people, and, materiel. Successful execution also requires political commitment 
and leadership, underpinned by trusted partnerships. The objectives and tasks 
within the Strategy should not be viewed as a one-time allocation of resources. 
Resourcing requirements should be revisited regularly based upon progress or 
shortfalls in the implementation of tasks or objectives of the Strategy.
The government may also consider the establishment of a central budget for 
cybersecurity, managed by a central cybersecurity governance mechanism. 
Whether assembling disparate funding sources into a coherent, integrated 
programme or creating a unified intra-governmental budget, the overall 
programme should be managed and tracked by milestones to ensure 
successful implementation of the Strategy.
5.1.6 Develop an implementation plan
The Strategy should be accompanied by, or reference, an implementation plan 
that outlines in greater detail how its strategic objectives will be achieved. 
Effective implementation plans identify the accountable entity responsible 
for each task and objective, the resources required to execute them over time 
(near-term, mid-term, long-term), the processes that will be used, and the 
outcomes that are expected (Section 3.4 on Initiating Implementation).
Further references available on page 63.37
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
This focus area introduces good practices for addressing cybersecurity 
through risk management. As stipulated in the Principle of Risk Management 
and Resilience (Section 4.2), a risk-management approach should be adopted, 
as cyber-risks cannot be fully eliminated. Rather, ensuring that a country has 
a good understanding of the risks that it is exposed to allows it to manage 
these most effectively. In terms of assessing risk, the approach should 
focus on identifying inter-dependencies and also consider risks arising from 
dependencies across the national border. The risk-management approach 
should consider the whole lifecycle, from development or procurement to 
operation and replacement.
It is also important to note that, as cybersecurity threats are extremely dynamic 
and unpredictable, any risk-management approach should be reviewed 
regularly. As such, the Strategy should plan for monitoring and evaluation of 
risk- management activities to ensure continuous improvement.
5.2.1 Conduct a cyber threat assessment and align policies with the ever-
expanding cyber threat landscape
The Strategy should identify and evaluate the evolving cyber threat 
environment and potential impact and consequences on critical 
infrastructures and essential services. The Strategy should first identify 
the country’s domestic critical infrastructures and services – those physical 
and cyber systems and assets that are vital to the proper functioning of 
society and economy, and whose incapacitation or destruction would have 
a debilitating impact of the physical or economic security or public health or 
safety of the country.
A cyber threat landscape assessment should be conducted to identify the 
specific cyber threats and risks page  critical infrastructures and services, 
as well as the individuals who use and rely upon them, and to help prioritize 
resources to protect them. Such an assessment would also inform and help 
align cyber risk management strategies with the country’s crisis management 
plan. It can also help harness the necessary capabilities/capacities, people, 
funding, and strategies to strengthen the overall cybersecurity posture of  
the Nation.
5.2.2 Define a risk-management approach
The Strategy should define a coherent approach for risk management to 
be followed by all government entities and critical infrastructure operators 
identified domestically. 
The approach should aim to build upon the cyber threat assessment and 
develop a national risk register, securely stored and communicated, to allow 
government oversight of risks and approaches taken to manage these. 
The approach should moreover develop a method of prioritisation based 
on a calculation of the probability of realising the risks and their impact. It 
should furthermore specify the responsibilities of key entities in each sector 
regarding the assessment, acceptance, and treatment of national-level 
cybersecurity risks.5.2
Focus area 2 - 
Risk management 
in national 
cybersecurity38
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
5.2.3 Identify a common methodology for managing cybersecurity risk
The Strategy should identify a common methodology for managing 
cybersecurity risks. This will ensure efficiency and consistency across all 
organisations and facilitate the exchange of threat and risk information across 
inter-dependent systems. A methodology based on international standards 
should be favoured as it may reduce costs and yield better interaction with the 
private sector.
The methodology should provide guidance on assigning roles and 
responsibilities for various aspects of managing risk, such as assessing the 
threats, valuing assets, implementing and maintaining mitigating measures, 
and accepting the residual risk. The methodology should include a certification 
programme to help assess and eventually improve compliance.
Importantly, for the procurement and development of infrastructures or 
services, the risk-management methodology should provide guidance 
on minimising risk through secure architecture and design and regular 
assessments/audits, recognising that security is best achieved when it is an 
integral part of the design, development, and implementation process of a 
product, process, or service (security by design).
5.2.4 Develop sectoral cybersecurity risk profiles
The Strategy should call for the use of sectoral risk profiles for cybersecurity. 
A sectoral risk profile is a quantitative analysis of the types of threats faced. 
The goal of a risk profile is to provide a less-subjective understanding of risk by 
assigning numerical values to variables representing different types of threats 
and the danger they pose. The Strategy should recommend risk profiles to 
be developed for those sectors that the country considers most critical to its 
society and economy. (These sectoral risk profiles could be part of the cyber 
threat landscape assessment discussed in section 5.2.1)
The use of sectoral risk profiles provides a basis for more specific risk 
assessments for individual organisations, introduces coherence within 
and across all sectors nationally, and reduces the resources needed for 
organisational risk assessments. They should be regularly updated to ensure 
that they remain current.
5.2.5 Establish cybersecurity policies
The Strategy should encourage the establishment of cybersecurity policies 
for critical national entities, such as government authorities and critical 
infrastructures operators, among others. Such policies, adopted in accordance 
with the Principle of an Appropriate Set of Policy Instruments (Section 4.7), 
would cover governance, operational and technical requirements, and instruct 
stakeholders on their roles and responsibilities, as well as guide or mandate 
specific approaches to these issues.
For example, this could include policies that address cybersecurity in 
procurement or development, define information-sharing programmes, 
coordinate vulnerability disclosure, set minimum standards of care, specify 39
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
security baselines, define certification programmes for compliance, and 
mandate the reporting of cybersecurity –incidents to the competent authorities.
A coordinated approach at the national level would lead to more efficient and 
effective cybersecurity management, as it would harmonise practices and 
facilitate coordination and interoperability.
Further references available on page 64.
This focus area provides an overview of good practices that support the 
establishment and sustainability of effective national capabilities to prepare 
for, prevent, detect, mitigate and respond to major cybersecurity incidents, and 
to improve a country’s overall cyber-resilience.
5.3.1 Establish cyber-incident response capabilities
The Strategy should call for the establishment of an appropriate national 
incident response capabilities to address operational cybersecurity 
challenges. Often, this capability refers to the establishment of Computer 
Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), Computer Security Incident Response 
Teams (CSIRTs) or Computer Incident Response Teams (CIRTs) with national 
responsibility.
Although the specific organizational form of a CERT/CSIRT/CIRT may vary 
(e.g., national, government, sectoral, etc.), and not every country may have 
the same needs and resources, these specialised and dedicated teams should 
provide a set of both proactive and reactive functions, as well as preventive 
and educational services. Thus, these entities can increase a country’s ability 
to respond quickly and recover from cyberattacks, as well as improve its 
resilience against cyber-threats, reducing the possible overall economic and 
operational impact of nationally significant cyberattacks.
The areas of services that CERT/CSIRT/CIRT can offer include cyber-incident 
response and coordination, vulnerability management, situational awareness, 
knowledge transfer, and threat and intelligence information sharing. The 
Strategy may also encourage the establishment of PSIRT (Product Security 
Incident Response Teams) by private sectors to enhance their ability to handle 
ICT product vulnerabilities.
The Strategy should also identify and develop cooperation mechanisms 
and communication procedures between national and sectorial incident 
response teams (should they exist in the country), as well as with international 
counterparts. 
5.3.2 Establish contingency plans for cybersecurity crisis management and 
disaster recovery
The Strategy should call for the development of a national contingency plan 
for cybersecurity emergencies and crises. The plan should be part of, or 
aligned with, the overall national contingency plan. A specific plan for critical 
information infrastructures should also be considered.5.3
Focus area 3 - 
Preparedness and 
resilience40
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
This national cybersecurity contingency plan should consider the findings from 
the national risk assessments and any cross-sector dependencies that could 
affect the continuity of operations of critical infrastructures, as well as any 
disaster recovery mechanisms. Moreover, it should provide an overview of the 
national incident response mechanisms; as well as highlight how cybersecurity 
incidents are categorised and escalated, based on their impact on critical 
assets and services.
5.3.3 Promote information-sharing
The Strategy should call for the establishment of information-sharing 
mechanisms to enable the exchange of actionable intelligence and threat 
information between and amongst the public and private sectors.
Formal and informal information-sharing programmes can help foster effective 
coordination and consistent, accurate and appropriate communications during 
incident response and recovery activities; facilitate rapid sharing of threat and 
intelligence information among affected parties and other stakeholders; help 
improve the understanding of how and which sectors have been targeted; 
disseminate information on the methods that can be used to defend and 
mitigate damage on the affected assets; and ultimately reduce vulnerabilities 
and exposure along with their attendant risks.
The Strategy should identify one or more institutional structures (i.e., 
competent authorities) responsible for transmitting accurate and actionable 
information among the national cybersecurity community, including the public 
and private sectors.
Information-sharing should be a two-way process. If governments are willing 
to share the information they retain, their actions will demonstrate to private 
sector entities that the government is indeed a partner in threat information 
sharing, and help ensure that responders are focused on and better prepared 
to respond to essential threats.
5.3.4 Conduct cybersecurity exercises
The Strategy should encourage the organisation and coordination of domestic 
and international cybersecurity and incident response exercises. These can 
follow different formats (e.g., simulations or real-time exercises) and target the 
technical and non-technical audiences.
Cybersecurity exercises and other crisis planning mechanisms can help 
countries develop the institutional capacity to perform incident response 
effectively, test crisis-management procedures and communication 
mechanisms, verify the operational ability of CERTs/CSIRTs/CIRTs to respond 
to cybersecurity incidents and service disruptions under pressure, and help 
understand any cross-sector dependencies.
Similarly, international cybersecurity exercises can help strengthen cyber-
incident response capacity among countries, understand cross-border 
dependencies, build confidence and trust between countries, and improve the 
overall international resilience and preparedness levels.41
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
5.3.5 Establish impact or severity assessment of cybersecurity incidents
The Strategy should encourage the establishment of impact or severity 
assessment mechanisms to assess and evaluate cybersecurity incidents based 
on their impact on critical assets, services, infrastructure, and people. This 
type of assessments aims to understand the larger context of a cyber-related 
incident, including its potential and actual impacts on different sectors and/or 
population groups and its cascading effects.
Such assessments should be conducted in consultation with a wide range of 
stakeholders in an open, inclusive, and transparent manner. The assessments 
should be integrated into the national disaster recovery and contingency plans, 
and the results should inform cyber incident response overall.
Further references available on page 65. 
This focus area investigates good practice relating to identifying and 
protecting Critical Infrastructures (CIs) and Critical Information Infrastructures 
(CIIs), and strengthening their resilience. The Strategy should recognise and 
promote the importance of advancing the security and continuity of CI and 
CII. The potential consequences of an incident impacting CI or CII can disrupt 
social order, the delivery of essential services, and the economic wellbeing 
of a country, and the Strategy should emphasize the importance of cyber risk 
management efforts intended to reduce the likelihood of such disruptive or 
destructive cyber incidents.
While there are no universally recognised definitions for the terms CI and CII, 
and governments need to consider which entities and services to include 
based on their own national risk assessment, for the purpose of this Guide, 
these terms are defined as follows:
• Critical Infrastructures (CI) are assets that are essential to the functioning 
and security of a society and economy in any given nation; and
• Critical Information Infrastructures (CII) are IT and ICT systems that 
operate key functions of the critical infrastructure of a nation.
Whereas the concept of essential services may be applied in reference 
to services that are essential for the maintenance of critical societal or 
economic activities.
In either case, a few non-exhaustive examples of these CI, CII or essential 
services include: energy (electricity, oil and gas), transportation (air, rail, water 
and road), finance and banking (credit institutions, trading venues and central 
counterparties), healthcare (healthcare organisations, including hospitals, 
private clinics, and research institutions), utilities (water and sanitation supply 
and distribution), digital and telecommunications (fixed and mobile telephone 
services and provision of internet infrastructure, such as internet exchange 
points (IXPs) and domain name service (DNS), among others). Definitions and 
designations may ultimately depend on the geopolitical, economic, and cultural 
characteristics of the national context.5.4
Focus area 4 -  
Critical 
Infrastructure and 
essential services42
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
5.4.1 Establish a risk-management approach to identifying and protecting 
critical infrastructure and essential services
The Strategy should address the importance of protecting CIs and CIIs from 
cyber-related risks and devising a comprehensive risk-management approach in 
accordance with the Principle of Risk Management and Resilience (Section 4.6).
A detailed risk assessment should guide the identification of national CIs and 
CIIs and essential services, whose disruption may have a serious impact on the 
health, safety, security, or economic well-being of citizens, or on the effective 
functioning of government or the economy. The Strategy should include or be 
accompanied by a specific list of CIs and/or CIIs and their correlation, which 
can be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary. 
While there exist a variety of different methodologies to identify CI and 
CII, nations might consider applying sectorial or functional criteria, such as 
dependencies and interdependencies with other infrastructure, service, 
and scope of impact, and the relevance of the infrastructure for maintaining 
a minimum service supply level. In this designation and review process, 
the Strategy should envisage the early and ongoing involvement of all the 
relevant stakeholders including public authorities, semi-public, and/or private 
infrastructure operators.
Furthermore, a risk-based approach should be adopted to identify and 
prioritise the implementation of programmes, policies, and practices 
designed to protect and strengthen the security and resiliency of CIs and 
CIIs. These programmes and policies should be structured so that CI and 
CII meet a common baseline of security practices, while also maintaining a 
level of flexibility to be consistent with their own risk assessments and risk 
management priorities. In order to leverage existing best practices, enable 
domestic industry to integrate with global ICT supply chains, and avoid CI/CII 
interoperability issues across national borders, a risk-management approach 
based on well-established international standards might also be considered.
5.4.2 Adopt a governance model with clear responsibilities
The Strategy should at a high level describe the governance structure, roles, 
and responsibilities of the different stakeholders for CI and CII protection. As 
stipulated in the Principle of Clear Leadership, Roles and Resource Allocation 
(Section 4.8), an effective and efficient CI-protection programme requires that 
stakeholders have clearly defined roles and responsibilities and establish a 
coordination mechanism for managing ongoing issues.
CIs and CIIs are often not owned or controlled by the government, and CI and 
CII protection efforts generally exceed the capabilities and mandate of any 
single agency in a government. Thus, appointing an overall coordinator for CI 
and CII (cyber-)security, such as an interagency committee, can greatly assist 
in efforts to protect critical infrastructure.
The governance model for CI and CII protection should include the identification 
of government entities in charge of specific verticals, the responsibilities 
and accountability of operators of CIs and CIIs, as well as the communication 43
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
channels and cooperation mechanisms between public and private agencies to 
ensure the operation and recovery of critical services and infrastructures.
The governance model should include mechanisms that ensure coordination 
and alignment across government entities with overlapping missions. The 
governance should also ensure that sectoral regulators create clear and 
consistent security requirements that avoid duplication of tasks and streamline 
important compliance efforts across both public and private sector entities.
5.4.3 Define minimum cybersecurity baselines
The Strategy should either highlight the existing or propose the development 
of new legislative and regulatory frameworks outlining minimum cybersecurity 
baselines for CI and CII operators, among others. Security baselines 
should address a range of high-level risk management priorities as well as 
more specific cybersecurity practices, such as identifying cyber risks and 
establishing risk management governance structures; protecting data and 
systems via access management protocols and other measures; monitoring 
digital environments and detecting potential anomalies or events; and 
responding to and recovering from incidents. When developing such baselines, 
internationally-recognised standards and best practices should be considered 
to ensure better security outcomes and greater efficiencies. Baselines that 
are relevant across sectors should be developed as a starting point, enabling 
greater interoperability and consistency of sector-specific practices and 
streamlined compliance for cross-sector functions.  
The Strategy should also highlight that cybersecurity baselines should be 
outcome-focused to ensure greater agility over time as the risk landscape 
and technology continue to rapidly evolve. Articulating what organisations 
should aim to achieve (e.g., “control logical access to critical resources”), 
rather than how organisations should implement security (e.g., “utilise two-
factor authentication”), can allow government and industry to benefit from 
continuous security improvements. In addition, an outcome-based approach to 
the development of these baselines can be complemented by sector-specific 
implementation or “how to” guidance, which provides options to inform and 
integrate enterprise practices.
In addition to addressing a range of high-level risk management priorities, 
cybersecurity baselines should also include procurement requirements to ensure 
that ICT suppliers have adequate and auditable security measure in place.  
The Strategy should support the establishment of a resilient CI and CII national 
environment, and prepare stakeholders to respond, mitigate, and recover 
from potential cybersecurity incidents. The risk management approach should 
encourage the adoption of crisis management processes, business continuity 
measures, and recovery plans. 
5.4.4 Utilise a wide range of market levers
The Strategy should consider a wide range of policies to ensure that all 
organisations and individuals are indeed incentivised to fulfil their individual 
cybersecurity responsibilities, commensurate with the risks they face, in 44
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
accordance with the principle of comprehensive approach and tailored priorities 
(Section 4.2).
Identifying gaps between what the markets can and should drive and what 
the risk environment requires is a crucial step towards determining when and 
how to leverage the range of incentives and disincentives available to improve 
security. To encourage the uptake of cybersecurity standards and practices 
across CIs and CIIs, the Strategy should indicate that the government will 
consider a range of policy options and market levers at its disposal.
5.4.5 Establish public private partnerships
The Strategy should encourage the creation of formal public-private 
partnerships to increase the security of CIs and CIIs. Public-private 
partnerships are a cornerstone of effectively protecting critical infrastructure 
and managing security risks in both the short- and long-term. They are essential 
for boosting trust amongst and between industry and the government.
However, establishing sustainable partnerships requires that all of the 
participating stakeholders have a clear understanding of the goals of the 
partnership and the mutual security benefits that stem from working together. 
Some of the areas could include: developing cross-sector and sector-specific 
cybersecurity baselines, establishing effective coordinating structures and 
information-sharing processes and protocols, building trust, identifying and 
exchanging ideas, approaches and best practices for improving security, as well 
as improving international coordination.
Further references available on page 67. 
Technology and policy considerations can dominate cybersecurity discussions, 
overlooking the fundamental human element at its core. This Focus Area 
addresses the challenges related to advancing cybersecurity capacity building 
(both human and institutional) and awareness raising among stakeholders, 
including government entities, citizens, businesses, and other organisations – 
crucial to enabling a country’s digital economy.
Good practices considered in this section include the coordination of capacity 
building activities, the establishment of dedicated cybersecurity curricula and 
awareness raising programmes, expansion of training schemes and workforce-
development programmes, adoption of international certification schemes, and 
promotion of innovation and research and development (R&D) clusters.
5.5.1 Strategically plan capability and capacity building and awareness raising
The Strategy should assign clear roles and responsibilities to entities tasked 
with the coordination of capacity building and awareness raising activities 
at the national level to ensure resources are streamlined, efforts are not 
duplicated, and accountability is established. The appointed national authorities 
should also be responsible for monitoring the implementation and evaluating the 
outcomes of these activities, as well as recommending changes if necessary.5.5

Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
Cybersecurity capability and capacity building and awareness raising should 
be evidence-based and strategically planned. A detailed assessment of the 
national cybersecurity landscape and current capacity building initiatives 
should guide the identification of existing gaps in capacity needs, skills, and 
awareness and inform forward-looking solutions. Given differences within 
and among countries and regions, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to 
cybersecurity capability and capacity building, so the information gathered 
should be used to design approaches tailored to the specific political, 
economic, and social context.  The responsible authorities might also produce 
an action plan that includes budget allocations, timelines, and metrics to 
monitor the progress of each of these planned actions. 
5.5.2 Develop cybersecurity curricula
The Strategy should facilitate the development or expansion of dedicated 
school curricula aimed at accelerating cybersecurity skills development and 
awareness throughout the formal education system. Curricula should be 
inter/multi-disciplinary and cover not only technical but also non-technical 
cybersecurity skills and topics, such as digital literacy, public policy, law, 
governance, economics, risk management, ethics, social sciences, and 
international relations. Dedicated cybersecurity curricula should be developed 
across primary and secondary schools, integrating cybersecurity courses in 
all computer science and IT programmes in higher education, and creating 
dedicated cybersecurity degrees and apprenticeships.
Given the multi-disciplinary nature of cybersecurity education, universities, 
colleges, and other educational institutions should be encouraged to 
work across departments and with other academic partners to optimize 
resources and efforts when developing or updating their programmes. 
These institutions can play a critical role in educating civilian and military 
workforces on the unique tenets of cybersecurity and can serve as incubators 
for future workforce, bringing together theory with methodology, tools, 
and implementation, and optimizing campus-wide resources to combine 
knowledge, intellectual capacity, and practical skills.
Additionally, the curricula should foster awareness of and stimulate interest 
in cybersecurity career opportunities. To further the efforts in this space, the 
government should also consider establishing various incentive schemes, 
such as scholarships for private education programmes and grants for relevant 
apprenticeships.
5.5.3 Stimulate capacity development and workforce training
The Strategy should encourage the development of cybersecurity training 
and skills development schemes for experts and non-experts in both public 
and private sectors. The effort could include the provision of executive and 
operational training, formal internships and traineeships, and (national and 
international) certification of security professionals, based on the needs 
identified by industry and government. The Strategy should also encourage 
specific training for national-level actors involved in domestic and foreign 
policy, including regulators and legislators. Trainings should be complemented 
with initiatives focused on cyber risk management, and with practical exercises 46
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
within and among government entities and other stakeholders such as drills 
and simulations. 
The Strategy should also foster initiatives that aim to develop dedicated 
cybersecurity career paths and an effective pipeline of future employees, 
in particular for the public sector, and promote incentives to increase the 
supply of qualified cybersecurity professionals and help retain talent. These 
should be created in partnership with academia, the private sector, and civil 
society. To address the ongoing gender gap of experts in cybersecurity, a 
gender-balanced approach that motivates, encourages, and facilitates more 
engagement from women should be considered across all efforts aimed at 
skills-development and training, ensuring inclusivity in the future.
5.5.4 Implement a coordinated cybersecurity awareness-raising programme
The entities responsible for cybersecurity awareness campaigns and 
activities at the national level should collaborate with relevant stakeholders 
to develop and implement cybersecurity awareness programmes focusing on 
disseminating information about cybersecurity risks and threats, as well as 
about best practices for countering them.
A cybersecurity awareness-raising programme could include awareness-
raising campaigns aimed at the general public, children, digitally challenged, 
consumer- focused education programmes, and awareness-raising initiatives 
among others, targeted at executives across public and private sectors. 
Awareness programmes should include relevant KPIs and metrics for 
measuring impact and effectiveness.
5.5.5 Foster cybersecurity innovation and R&D
The Strategy should foster an environment that stimulates basic and applied 
research in cybersecurity across sectors and various stakeholder groups. 
Such initiatives include, for example, ensuring that national research efforts 
support the objectives of the National Cybersecurity Strategy; developing 
cybersecurity-focused R&D programmes in public research organisations; 
effective development and dissemination of new findings, baseline 
technologies, techniques, processes, and tools. The strategy should also 
envisage developing an efficient and sufficient local market of cybersecurity 
services.
Moreover, as part of the Strategy, countries should also seek to establish 
ties with the international research community in the scientific fields related 
to cybersecurity, such as computer science, electrical engineering, applied 
mathematics and cryptography, but also non-technical fields such as social 
and political sciences, business and management studies, criminology and 
psychology to name a few.
The Strategy should look at incentive mechanisms available from grants, 
procurements, tax credits, competitions, and other initiatives that encourage 
the development of innovative cybersecurity solutions, products, and services.47
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
5.5.6 Tailor programmes for vulnerable sectors and groups
The Strategy should identify those groups of society which require particular 
attention when it comes to cybersecurity capacity and capability building and 
awareness raising. These include groups which have been identified as being 
particularly at risk or which need to be empowered to protect themselves, such 
as small and medium enterprises (SMEs), community-based organizations 
(CBOs), underserved communities, and/or low-income communities.   
Further references available on page 68. 
This focus area covers the development of a legal and regulatory framework 
to protect society against cybercrime and promote a safe and secure cyber 
environment, in accordance with the Principles of Inclusiveness, Fundamental 
Human Rights, and on Trust Environment (Sections 4.3, 4.5 and 4.9, 
respectively). Such a framework should include: the adoption of legislation that 
defines what constitutes illegal cyber-activity, as well as the procedural tools 
that are needed to investigate and prosecute these crimes at the national level 
and for cooperating cross-border; establishment of compliance mechanisms; 
the building of capacity to enforce the framework; institutionalization of critical 
entities; and international cooperation to fight cybercrime. The framework 
should recognize and be consistent with the country’s obligations under 
international, regional, and national human rights law.
Cybersecurity, cybercrime, and protection of personal data are interrelated 
concepts. Countries should establish a legal and regulatory framework which 
covers these three areas in a holistic and coherent way.
The Strategy should inform and guide the development of legislation so that 
roles and responsibilities of actors involved in applying the law are clear 
and well-defined, while ensuring compliance with existing legal principles 
and provisions. The Strategy should map the existing legal and regulatory 
framework, including operational aspects, and identify areas where new or 
revised legislation and regulation is required.
5.6.1 Establish a domestic legal framework for cybersecurity
The Strategy should encourage the development of domestic cybersecurity 
and data protection legal frameworks, which refer to actions relevant to the 
prevention, monitoring, and handling of cyber-related incidents, and any other 
action that public and private entities should undertake to foster a secure and 
resilient national cyberspace.
In the current absence of an international legal instrument defining the aspects 
of cybersecurity regulations, the country will have to rely on regional and/
or national best practices for establishing its domestic legal frameworks for 
cybersecurity. The Strategy should build upon current acts and regulations 
tackling such aspects, if any, and establish, update, and reform the legal 
framework for cybersecurity, including but not limited to: information 
security rules and their applicability to the security of information systems; 
identification of national critical information infrastructure; establishment 5.6
Focus area 6 - 
Legislation and 
regulation48
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
of national and sectoral agencies dealing with cybersecurity aspects (i.e., 
national cybersecurity agencies, national and sectoral CERTs/CSIRT/CIRT); 
certification of cybersecurity organisations, processes, products, and policies; 
national/state security rules applicable to security of cyberspace; and other 
relevant matters.
Further, the Strategy should provide guidance on how to deal with common 
regulatory approaches that concern both cybersecurity and cybercrime (for 
example, cross-sectoral exchange of information and intelligence sharing 
mechanisms, reporting and criminal justice statistics, joint response and 
public-private cooperation, among others). 
5.6.2 Establish a domestic legal framework on cybercrime and electronic 
evidence
The Strategy should promote the development of a domestic legal framework 
that clearly defines what constitutes cybercrime and related criminal offences, 
and that provides adequate procedural powers for effective investigation and 
prosecution, as well as adjudication of related cases on the basis of admissible 
electronic evidence. 
Most often, this capability takes the form of cybercrime legislation, which can 
be achieved by enacting specific new laws or amending existing ones (e.g., the 
penal code, laws regulating banking, telecommunications and other sectors). 
These laws should specify: substantive criminal offences (offences against or 
by means of computer systems or data); procedural means to collect electronic 
evidence (ranging from preservation of integrity of data to search and seizure, 
and from production order to real-time interception of content data); and tools 
for expedited and effective international cooperation in such cases. In order 
to establish clear and enforceable cybercrime legislation across borders, 
countries should try to harmonize their domestic legal framework with existing 
international and regional legal instruments on this matter.
The Strategy should provide guidance also to operational aspects of 
cybercrime investigation and prosecution (e.g., establishment of specialized 
units, proper digital forensics capacities, standard operating procedures,  
crime reporting, etc.) that may not be set at the level of primary legislation  
but could be nevertheless provided as secondary regulations, guidelines, or 
best practices. 
The Strategy should also encourage the creation of a process to monitor the 
implementation and review of legislation and governance mechanisms, identify 
gaps and overlapping authorities, and clarify and prioritise areas that require 
modernisation (e.g., existing laws such as old telecommunication laws).
5.6.3 Recognise and safeguard human rights and liberties
The Strategy should promote the development of domestic legal frameworks 
on cybersecurity, cybercrime and other related areas that respect and protect 
human rights. In doing so, the differences of context between cybersecurity 
(technical aspects of security) and cybercrime (criminal justice response) 
should be properly highlighted and considered.49
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
The Strategy should pay particular attention to technology-related legal issues 
that can affect the level of cybersecurity and which have impacts on human 
rights (e.g. encryption, anonymity vulnerability disclosure, ethical hacking 
and others). In doing so, the Strategy should promote approaches that are 
consistent with individuals’ human rights.
In terms of cybercrime and criminal justice matters overall, the Strategy should 
safeguard essential due process rights applicable in criminal investigations and 
prosecutions, as well as rights of privacy and personal data protection, and 
freedom of expression, in accordance with the Principle of Fundamental Human 
Rights and Trust (Sections 4.5 and 4.9). 
The strategy should also ensure that the rights of those who are victims of 
– or at risk from –  cyber incidents and cybercrime are sufficiently taken into 
consideration and protected.
5.6.4 Create compliance mechanisms
The Strategy should promote the establishment of domestic compliance 
mechanisms (both enforcement and incentives). These mechanisms should 
be set in place to prevent, combat, and mitigate actions directed against the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ICT systems and infrastructures, 
and threatening computer data, in accordance with the aforementioned legal 
framework. They should inter alia cover the particularities of response to 
cyber incidents, criminal investigations, specialized procedures (such as lawful 
interception of communications), and use of electronic evidence.
5.6.5 Promote capacity-building for law enforcement
The Strategy should encourage the development of cyber-law-enforcement 
capacity, including training and education for a range of stakeholders 
involved in combating cybercrime (e.g., judges, prosecutors, lawyers, law-
enforcement officials, forensic specialists, financial investigators, and others). 
Law enforcement should receive specialised training to interpret and apply 
domestic cybercrime laws (i.e., translate the law into technical notions and 
vice versa); to effectively detect, deter, investigate and prosecute cybercrime 
offenses while respecting human rights; and to effectively collaborate with 
industry and international law-enforcement entities (e.g., INTERPOL, Europol) 
to tackle cybercrime and to boost cybersecurity. Such training and education 
should be continuous and cover all relevant criminal justice and security 
professionals, and should be kept continuously up-to-date with current cyber-
related challenges and threats. This element should take into consideration 
focus area 5 on Capability and Capacity Building and Awareness Raising 
(Section 5.5).
5.6.6 Establish inter-organisational processes
The Strategy should identify and recognise the mandates of domestic agencies 
with the primary authority to ensure compliance with cybercrime legislation 
(primarily criminal justice authorities and forensic services), those responsible 
for prevention of and response to cyber incidents that raise to the national 
level (including protection of critical information infrastructures), and those 50
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
responsible for ensuring that all international cybercrime requirements are 
being met (e.g., ensure that national laws comply with international treaty 
obligations) and across judicial lines (e.g., cross-border cooperation) (see also 
Section 5.1.3 and 5.1.4; and Section 5.6.6).
5.6.7 Support international cooperation to combat cyber threats and 
cybercrime  
The Strategy should demonstrate a commitment to protect society against 
cybercrime globally, through ratification, where possible and in accordance 
with the overall national agenda, of international cybercrime agreements 
or equivalent agreements to fight cybercrime, and through the promotion 
of coordination mechanisms to address international cybercrime. This may 
include aligning national laws with international treaty obligations and bilateral 
agreements, for example by establishing mutual legal assistance, enabling 
cross-border investigations and prosecutions, handling of digital evidence, 
and extradition. 
Also, the Strategy should recognize the importance of building informal 
mechanisms that enable trusted cooperation and cross-border exchange of 
information, intelligence, and technical support between cybersecurity actors 
in both public and private sector.
In particular, international law enforcement cooperation plays a vital role in 
combating cybercrime through the exchange of information, cross-border 
investigations, operations, and arrests. For example, INTERPOL provides a 
secure global police communications system for countries to facilitate police-
to-police requests and formal mutual legal assistance requests from one 
central authority to another. These channels can assist in the investigation 
and prosecution of cybercrime beyond a nation’s borders. Law enforcement 
cooperation can also help improve cross-jurisdictional interoperability and 
ensure timely and coordinated joint police actions. Other organizations like 
AFRIPOL, AMERIPOL, ASEANAPOL, GCCPOL, ECOPOL, and Europol are 
likewise fostering law enforcement cooperation at the regional level.
These elements should take into consideration focus area 7 on international 
cooperation (Section 5.7). 
Further references available on page 69. 
This focus area emphasises the elements that the Strategy should cover 
in terms of external cybersecurity engagements of a particular country, 
both at regional and international levels. With digitalisation impacting all 
areas of international relations, such as human rights; economic and social 
development; trade negotiations; commerce relations; arms control; the use 
of new and disruptive technologies; security of supply chains; and security, 
stability, peace, and conflict resolution, cybersecurity has become an integral 
part of a country’s foreign policy.
The Strategy should therefore recognise the borderless nature and 
international dimension of cybersecurity, and highlight the need to engage in 5.7
Focus area 7 - 
International 
cooperation51
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
international discussions and cooperate with both national and international 
stakeholders, as well as civil society, industry, and non-governmental 
organizations. International engagements with public and private stakeholders 
are key to facilitating a constructive dialogue, developing trust and cooperation 
mechanisms, finding mutually acceptable solutions and addressing common 
challenges, and creating a global understanding of the importance of 
cybersecurity and resilience.
In accordance with the principle of comprehensive approach and tailored 
priorities (Section 4.2), regional and international cooperation should be 
fostered in harmony with the political, social, cultural, and economic layout 
of the country. The country’s cybersecurity priorities should inform and be 
aligned with its foreign policy’s goals and vice versa.
5.7.1 Recognise cybersecurity as a component of foreign policy and align 
domestic and international efforts
The Strategy should express a commitment to international cooperation on 
cybersecurity and recognise cyber-issues as an integral component of the 
country’s foreign policy across all relevant areas, including international cyber 
stability and trade negotiation. 
The Strategy should clearly articulate the government’s focus areas and 
indicate long-term objectives for international cooperation, including which 
stakeholders (e.g., public, private, regional, global) would be engaged. Such 
focus areas might include, for instance, support for the establishment of 
international cybersecurity norms and confidence-building measures (CBMs), 
commitment to cybersecurity capacity-building (CCB), participation in the 
development of international cybersecurity standards, as well as joining 
existing regional and international processes.
Moreover, the Strategy should ensure consistency between the country’s 
domestic and foreign-policy agendas by harmonising its national legal 
framework and policies with its international commitments, and aligning its 
national cybersecurity approaches with its international efforts. This may 
also require harmonisation among different governmental entities (e.g., head 
of state and cabinet, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of ICT, Ministry of 
Industry and Trade, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Defence, etc.) so that 
the policy position expressed by one domestic entity at a negotiating table 
in the international arena is properly coordinated and aligned with other 
governmental bodies. 
5.7.2 Engage in international discussions and commit to implementation
The Strategy should identify specific international fora and cooperation 
mechanisms that the country wishes to join or cooperate with to effectively 
engage internationally on cyber-related issues. These could include regional 
or global organisations, standardisation bodies, intergovernmental or 
multistakeholder discussions, public and/or private-sector alliances, as well as 
established traditional cooperation and collaboration mechanisms that have a 
cyber or digital component.52
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
The Strategy should specify the country’s commitment to the application of 
international law, including the Charter of the United Nations and international 
human rights law. It could also outline a national commitment to join and 
implement existing regional and international instruments to combat 
cybercrime and other cyber threats (e.g., the Council of Europe’s Budapest 
Convention on Cybercrime, the African Union’s Convention on Cybersecurity, 
the Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences, 
the ECOWAS Directive on fighting cybercrime, etc.). The Strategy should 
recognize that many international trade agreements also have a digital or cyber 
component (e.g., the Wassenaar Arrangement governs dual-use technologies, 
and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the Regional 
Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) among Asia-Pacific nations 
govern cross-border data flows).  
The Strategy should also encourage the country’s commitment to the 
furtherance of voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace 
and of CBMs in cyberspace. Notable examples of international efforts and 
fora for the elaboration of such norms and CBMs include the UN Open-ended 
Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications 
technologies (OEWG), the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(OSCE) on confidence building measures and international norms applicable in 
cyberspace, the work of the G7 Group’s High-Tech Crime Subgroup, as well as 
other regional initiatives and multistakeholder efforts (e.g., Paris Call, industry 
initiatives, etc.). It is important to prioritise international engagement efforts, 
allocate adequate resources (personnel and money), and define adequate 
mandates to ensure that they deliver concrete results.
The Strategy should also express the commitment to the implementation of 
the agreed norms of voluntary State behaviour in cyberspace such as the ones 
proposed by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in 
the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International 
Security in its 2015 report, and further developed by the GGE on Advancing 
responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international 
security, which concluded its work in May 2021.
5.7.3 Promote formal and informal cooperation in cyberspace
The Strategy should indicate the operational (both public and private sector) 
international cooperation mechanisms that the country wishes to commit to. 
The country may wish to engage in formal and informal international endeavors 
advancing cooperation on policy and legislative development, law enforcement 
(e.g., INTERPOL, EUROPOL, WIPO), incident response, information- and threat-
sharing (e.g., FIRST, ISACs), among others. Participation in such initiatives 
could support better cooperation and exchange of timely and actionable 
information between relevant authorities on potential threats and vulnerabilities 
and coordination in defense and response mechanisms. 
Cross-border information exchanges with private sector organizations and 
industry dealing with cybersecurity threats (anti-virus companies, threat 
intelligence community, global social media providers and other relevant 
actors) should be considered an important component of international 
cooperation efforts as well.53
Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2nd Edition5 – NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY GOOD PRACTICE
5.7.4 Promote capacity building for international cooperation
As the country begins to undertake international engagements, these will likely 
require the government to develop additional competencies and skills focused 
on cyber-issues and increase its overall capacity to address an ever-increasing 
range of cyber issues, including international cyber stability, data protection 
and privacy, trade, commerce, arms control, the use of new and disruptive 
technologies, security of supply, and other digital matters. 
In order to effectively engage in international discussions and cooperation, it 
is important to encourage the development and use of competencies and skills 
focused on cyber-issues (including cyber-diplomacy and trade negotiations) 
to complement the traditional methods and processes of diplomacy and trade. 
The Strategy may also include the development of specific organisational 
structures and the establishment of some dedicated office or trained personnel 
whose primary focus is diplomatic engagement on cyber-issues relating to 
trade, diplomacy, and international law.
Other priority areas for capacity building may include CERT/CSIRT cooperation, 
law enforcement and judicial cooperation, applicable public international law, 
voluntary norms of responsible State behaviour, etc. Various international 
capacity building programmes are available to support such efforts (e.g., 
GLACY+, Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE), INTERPOL, etc.). For 
instance, law enforcement capacity building efforts can help local and 
national law enforcement agencies enhance their skills, knowledge, and 
technical capabilities to leverage high-tech tools and systems for cross-border 
cybercrime prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecution.  They can 
also allow law enforcement to keep abreast of cybercrime trends and ever-
evolving threat landscape to stay ahead of crime.
The Strategy should consider existing regional and international cybersecurity 
initiatives and foster harmonisation and alignment. This would allow the 
country to leverage existing good practices, as well as to contribute towards 
cohesion and convergence of cybersecurity approaches.
The Strategy should encourage peer-learning and the transfer of cybersecurity 
knowledge and skills with international partners. Furthermore, participation 
in international events and cybersecurity exercises can provide both means 
for cybersecurity capacity building and for building trust and fostering 
international cooperation.
