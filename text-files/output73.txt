1 Results in Brief
1.1 Executive Summary
Working Group 2B of the Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council
(CSRIC) was charged with the “MSRC Best Practice Update”
The Working Group examined and updated the 4 documents produced by the MSRC II Tool Kit
Working Group, which included broadcast, DTH, CATV and MVDS systems.
In MSRC I, a number of best practices were created. During the time between MSRC I and II it
was found that because the best practices were written at the 50,000 foot level they did not
translate well into actionable items for the local engineering and operating personnel.
MSRC II Tool Kit working group turned those best practices into a sample manual on how to
setup a disaster recovery plan and a self assessment check list on the preparedness of a facility.
It is critical to note that these documents are not applicable in every situation because of
variation of the physical plants and geographic differences. These documents are intended to be
voluntary for the industries in each document and may not apply in all cases.
2 Introduction
CSRIC was established as a Federal Advisory Committee designed to provide recommendations
to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding best practices and actions the
Commission can take to ensure optimal security, reliability, and interoperability of
communications systems, including telecommunications, media and public safety
communications systems.
CSRIC created ten working groups, each with its own area of responsibility. As a result,
Working Group 2B was charged with the “MSRC Best Practices Update”
The 2B working group, was comprised of individuals from all the industries needed to update
the existing MSRC II documents. Meetings were held during the length of the charter to review
and update those documents.
As stated in the executive summary, these new CSRIC documents are intended to be used by
local engineering and operational personnel at the various facilities in each of the industries.
They were derived from the MSRC I best practices, those best practices were taken into account
in the MSRC II documents. Part of each of these documents is a vulnerability checklist for each
of the industries.
The documents reflect the consensus of Working Group 2B, arrived at through a collaborative
process of discussions. The Working Group’s process was prepared primarily by the Working
Group chair in consultation with the Working Group members, but may not reflect in all details
the consensus of all members of the group.

3 Objective, Scope, and Methodology
3.1 Objective
This document addresses the objective and deliverables outlined in the charter for Working
Group 2B, as defined by the full CSRIC:
“The Media Security and Reliability Council (MSRC) produced a number of best
practices to the security and reliability of commercial broadcast, CATV and MVDS
systems. These best practices were last reviewed in December 2005, and much has
happened in the intervening years. Some of the best practices may be obsolete, some
may be in need of improvement, and others may need to be supplemented. This
Working Group will analyze the MSRC best practices and recommend improvements to
bring them up-to-date for CSRIC’s consideration.”
3.2 Scope
To rework and update the MSRC II documents.
3.3 Deliverables:
Four documents, one for television, radio, CATV, Direct to Home.
3.3.1 Recommendations
These documents, as updated, will be useful to the local engineering and operational personnel
of the various industries. They should be widely circulated to those industries to be used as
templates for their various disaster recovery scenarios. At a minimum the vulnerability
checklists should be reviewed at the local level of the various entities that these documents
target.
4 Conclusions
The Working Group 2B documents are intended to be voluntary for the industries in each
document and may not apply in all cases. In fact, sections from the various documents may be
combined to suit the facilities needs.
It is critical to note that these documents are not applicable in every situation because of
variation of the physical plants and geographic differences.
In general good disaster planning and recovery can only be successful with the proper

Final Report
preplanning of what to do when everything fails. It is also extremely important that these plans
be reviewed and updated on a regular basis, as facilities are continually modified and changed to
fit the various business needs.
Working Group 2B recommends the work product as submitted.

viIntroduction
The core of this document is the result of the Media Security and Reliability Council which was
chartered by the FCC to prepare a comprehensive national strategy for securing and sustaining
broadcast facilities throughout the United States during attacks, natural disasters and all other
threats nationwide.
Changes in technology required that this document be updated for The Communications
Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council to assure optimal reliability, robustness and
security. As of this date the MSRC I and MSRC II documents can be found at
http://www.mediasecurity.org.
Disaster recovery planning is a practical approach to contingency and risk management
designed to reduce the consequences associated with an extended disruption of essential
services. The scope of this document is to provide guidelines to develop a short term Disaster
Recovery Plan (DRP) and Incident Response Manual (IRM) (Appendix A) for use as a tool by
your organization for the timely resumption of essential services in emergency situations. Long-
term Disaster Recovery plans, and business recovery issues, while important, are beyond the
scope of this document. This document is generic in nature, and is designed to serve as a
template. [Radio station] is encouraged to adapt its use to accommodate any unique
requirements which may exist.
As you formulate your disaster recovery plans you should ask yourself what you would
do in the event your facility and all of the day-to-day operational resources you use were
no longer available.
Objectives
Figure 1 shows the basic disaster recovery planning steps that should be followed in
order to ensure that the timely recovery of essential services is initiated in the event of an
emergency situation.

Figure 1: Basic recovery planning steps
1The objective of this document is to provide guidelines and strategies that will allow [Radio
station] to effectively accomplish these steps by assessing the vulnerability and impact to critical
systems, and to recover operations and essential services in the event of a disruption caused by
a natural or man-made disaster or other emergency situations in an organized and efficient
manner. To meet these objectives the DRP should address the following major topics:
Vulnerability assessment and prevention.
Plan distribution and maintenance.
Staff roles and responsibilities.
Essential equipment, materials and services.
Internal and external communications.
Recovery strategies and procedures.
Periodic plan testing.
In the event of an incident, it is essential to ensure that proper levels of notification and
communication regarding the event are disseminated to personnel, emergency services and
other stakeholders.
It should be recognized that any plan should be flexible enough to be adapted to
the particular emergency situation. The key to recovering from an emergency situation,
with minimum impact, is to have a DRP and to follow it.
Requirements
When developing the DRP guidelines, the following requirements should be met:
All processes critical to the continuation of essential services should be identified.
Critical personnel should be identified and receive the plan.
The plan should be reviewed no less than annually.
The plan should be tested.
Availability of emergency information to the deaf and hard of hearing.
Availability of emergency information to non-English speaking persons.
Definition of Terms
The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout this document.

3Document Distribution
This section describes the procedures for distributing the DRP.
Procedures
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for the distribution of the DRP,
as well as any additional emergency procedures as applicable. The DRP document should be
distributed to the Incident Response Team (see Table 6) and others listed on the Master
Distribution List (see Table 3). Copies should also be kept in the following locations:
Master Hard Copy – The original printed version of the DRP that is used to generate
subsequent copies. A hard copy of the DRP should be located in the local Disaster Recovery
Planning Manager’s office.
Master Soft Copy – The original electronic version of the DRP that is used to generate
subsequent copies. An electronic copy of the DRP should be stored on a storage device that is
routinely backed up.
Distribution Copy #2 – A copy of the DRP should be kept at each facility if separate
facilities are used.
Distribution Copy #3 – A copy of the DRP should be kept at the Customer Support
and Network Operations Center (NOC).
Distribution Copy #4 – A copy of the DRP should be kept at a secure off-site location.
Distribution Copy #5 – When applicable, a copy of the DRP should reside at a
Division or Corporate office.
Distribution Copy #6 – Two copies of the DRP should reside at the Incident
Command Center (ICC) (see Table 5).
4The DRP contains proprietary company information and is not for general
distribution. Each individual possessing a copy is responsible for maintaining it in a
secure location, and in accordance with company policies for the protection of
proprietary information. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for
maintaining the DRP in an updated condition and distributing the revised document
whenever the DRP is updated.
DRP Maintenance
This section describes the procedures for maintaining the DRP. Maintenance
procedures consist of two general categories: scheduled and unscheduled. Scheduled
maintenance is time-driven, where unscheduled maintenance is event-driven.
Scheduled Maintenance
Scheduled maintenance consists of a scheduled annual review and updates as well as
an annual structured walkthrough and tactical exercises.
Scheduled maintenance occurs as the result of a scheduled review of the plans.
Reviews are predictable and are scheduled not less than annually. The purpose of the review is
to determine whether changes are required to strategies, tasks, notifications and assembly
procedures.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for initiating Scheduled
Maintenance activities. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should initiate reviews twice
yearly. The Incident Response Team and their alternates should review the strategies and
procedures for changes that may be required. The reviews should address events that have
occurred within each team members’ area of responsibility that may affect prevention, response
and recovery capability.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for any required updates to the
DRP which results from the review. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should import all
changes to the master hard copy, print hard copies of the plan, redistribute the copies as
described above, and ensure that all issued copies are updated to the same level as the master
hard copy.
Ongoing consideration should be given to how the DRP will be maintained and
stored in a secure and reliable manner. The DRP should be available to key personnel
under all circumstances.
Unscheduled Maintenance
Certain maintenance requirements are unpredictable and cannot be scheduled. The majority of
these unscheduled plan changes occur as the result of major changes to hardware, software,
network configurations, personnel changes, etc. The following are examples of items that may
trigger the need for unscheduled maintenance:
5Significant modifications in the physical plant (i.e., changes in equipment, audio
processing chain, network operating software, changes to signal wire routing,
changes in IT based local area or wide area networking connectivity, etc.).
Changes in on-site and off-site storage facilities (i.e. Parts and equipment storage
lockers, sheds, closets…. think about both physical and data storage).
Changes in major operations facilities (i.e., Air Studio, Production Studio, News
Room, Rack Room, STL origination, Digital audio (IBOC) or digital radio advanced
data services Transmitter Site).
Significant modification of business or operational support systems (i.e. traffic and
billing systems, music scheduling systems, automation systems, 3rd party interfaces
to external systems i.e. tagging, traffic or weather data services, textual emergency
alerts or anything that integrates with and affects day to day technical operations).
Personnel transfers, terminations, promotions, relocation (i.e., home telephone
and/or cell telephone number changes) or resignations of individuals from the
Incident Response Team.
Recent acquisition of or merger with another company.
Textual alert delivery that relies on IT specific resources or IP integration with 3rd
party delivery mechanisms.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should be made aware of all potential
changes to the plans resulting from unscheduled maintenance. The Disaster Recovery Planning
Manager should meet with the personnel submitting the change and update the DRP as
necessary.
6DRP Testing
This section describes the procedures for periodically testing the DRP.
Responsibility for Establishing Testing Scenarios
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and the station Technology Manager (Title
will vary depending on the company such as Chief Engineer, Director of Engineering) should
meet with all department heads named in the Master Distribution list to develop testing for each
department. For example, the Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and the Chief Engineer
should meet to identify all critical components of the air chain and compose testing scenarios for
each. At first, a block diagram of all major subsystems can be developed, then as the plan
matures; smaller subsystems can be included in the testing scenarios. A test for loss of main air
studio may involve switching to the news room or production studio, or may involve setting up
the station’s remote vehicle to provide on air material.
The input of all affected parties, such as DJ’s, Talk Show hosts, traffic managers, digital
content managers and others including non-technical personnel should be requested so that
routine tasks essential to the normal operations of the radio station are not overlooked.
While conducting DRP testing, it is essential to carefully document events as they occur
during the test, noting any unexpected, unusual or abnormal system operation. Be aware of the
amount of time and stress factors involved in carrying out DRP testing scenarios. It is
recommended that an engineering staff member or assistant be assigned the task of keeping a
log during the test. This will be of assistance during the review of the test to refine and improve
performance in subsequent testing.
7Scope and Type of Plan Testing
Conducting periodic tests of the DRP is encouraged to ensure that plans meet the
recovery needs defined by the organization. These tests should be structured so as to be
realistic without disrupting the normal business process. Testing should be planned, organized
and conducted in such a way that results can be documented, verified, and evaluated.
Disasters can happen in many ways, some unimaginable and unforeseeable.
Developing a testing scenario for each and every disaster may not be possible. The Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager should make every effort to identify all types of disasters likely to
occur in their locality and then imagine other disasters which may occur, though only rarely. All
disaster testing scenarios should be based on worst case conditions.
During the testing of the DRP it may not be possible to duplicate the actual conditions of
a disaster. For example, while conducting a test of the DRP for a complete evacuation of a
facility such as a bomb threat, the actual physical evacuation of personnel and customers may
not be practical because of the business disruption that will result from the test.
For some testing, a simulation can be used. For example, if the test for that day is
a complete building evacuation; non critical personnel can assemble at their assigned
meeting point, or, if the facility is in a high rise building, a simulated assembly area might
be the elevator lobby on the tested floor. The testing team would then interview the staff
to make certain they know what procedures to follow in the event of an actual building
evacuation.
Structured walkthrough.
A structured walkthrough is the first step in developing a testing strategy and may
consist of gathering department heads and touring the facility to identify critical areas of
concern. Each department head can identify the critical systems in their area of responsibility
while noting comments from others about inter-operability issues. A priority list of testing of all
major systems and subsystems can then be developed.
Site specific exercise.
Some locations may require site specific exercises. The plans and testing for the main
facilities may not work for other locations. Testing and planning need to be customized for all
locations.
Schedule of Plan Testing
It is recommended that a schedule be developed for testing of each critical system and
subsystem. For example, the “loss of transmitter” test might be scheduled during the night to
avoid drive time interruption of service. Critical systems should be tested more often than
ancillary subsystems. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager may require “loss of
transmitter” testing every three months, while “loss of air studio” testing may be performed only
once or twice per year and “loss of audio processing” less often. The DRP in its entirety should
be reviewed no less than annually.
8Some testing, for example, emergency generator power systems, should be done
regularly and tested annually with all power fully disconnected from the utility power grid. This
will verify that all critical systems are connected to the correct emergency backup power supply.
A local station that was testing its UPS and emergency power monthly, fully
expected to pass their annual test with all the power fully disconnected from the utility
power grid. All systems ran correctly as expected except that the main newsroom had no
lights. The newsroom was completely dark. During a recent electrical renovation the
newsroom lighting was connected to the wrong power source. This situation would not
have been found without this type of test.
Plan Testing Announcements
Announcements of major system and subsystem testing should be given far enough in
advance to allow for proper steps to be taken in preparation for the test. For example, if the
automation system is to be tested, technology support (Title will vary depending on the
company such as Engineering, IT, etc) should make sure that all data systems are fully backed
up and redundant. Steps should be taken in case the tested system fails the scheduled test to
make sure that there are no unplanned interruptions to the stations on air program material
(dead air).
In the event of a main transmitter systems test, steps must be taken in preparation for the
backup transmitter to be on standby in case unforeseen events prevent the main transmitter
from returning to or remaining on the air. In a typical radio engineering environment, a 7 to 10
day advance notice of DRP plan testing should be sufficient.
After the DRP is developed, consideration should be given to preparing an annual
schedule of systems and subsystems testing. This will assist engineering personnel in planning
maintenance tasks and upgrades to either coincide with or avoid DRP testing parameters.
In the event of an actual disaster, it is critical that a complete event log be kept to
allow for a later review of recovery efforts and any changes that may improve those
procedures.
Test Scenarios
In this section, all critical systems and subsystems are identified and categorized by
order of priority for creating a DRP testing strategy. Each radio station may have its own
particular vulnerabilities. As vulnerabilities are identified, a corresponding testing plan needs to
be developed. Here are some examples:
Disaster - Loss of transmitter site / tower, Recovery – Backup transmitter site.
Disaster – Loss of Air Studio, Recovery – move operations to newsroom or
production studio.
Disaster – Evacuation of building, Recovery – move operations to remote studio
vehicle or location.
Disaster – Loss of critical system data – Recovery – initiate file recovery procedures
9When composing the test scenario, consideration should be given to the complexity of
the test, how much time it will take to perform the test, how much time it will take to properly de-
brief and evaluate the test, and the general impact of the test on normal day to day operations
of the facility. Also, if the test includes change out of equipment and/or changes to normal signal
path routing, care should taken to restore the tested system to pre-test configuration. It is
recommended that careful system configuration notes and photos be taken before the test is
conducted to ensure that the system can be restored to normal operations.
Evaluation of Plan Testing
As each segment of the DRP is tested, an evaluation should be conducted to identify
problem areas in both the testing scenario and the recovery strategy. The following questions
will help to serve as a guide for evaluating the efficacy of the conducted tests:
Did the testing run smoothly?
Did the test run through all the steps to conclusion?
Is the test practical?
Does the test show that the planned recovery strategy is functional?
Does the test interfere with other systems or departments not included in the test?
Does the test interfere with listeners’ enjoyment of regularly scheduled
programming?
At the conclusion of the test, was a return to normal operations easily accomplished?
After completion of the test, a series of meetings should be held with the affected
departments, as well as the Incident Response Team and Emergency Evacuation Team in
order to compile observations, comments, and criticisms and give each participant a chance to
recommend if necessary, changes to the plan. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should
then update the plan and redistribute the revised plan.
It may be necessary to re-test the same segment of the plan multiple times before a
testing protocol is agreed upon by all concerned departments. Proper planning, testing and
implementation of recovery strategies will facilitate a fast and complete return to “normal”
operations during an emergency. Listeners will remember that it was your radio station that
stayed on the air and relayed important news and critical emergency information during the
crisis.
Remember, it is much easier to solve problems in the light of day than in the fog
of war.
Plan Testing History
DRP testing should be carefully documented to provide a complete record of events as
the plan is maintained and updated. The plan testing history will then provide an accurate record
of test results, evaluations and updates as well as a record of when each test segment of the
10plan was carried out. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager can use the test history as a
tool to determine what changes may have occurred if a test suddenly no longer works. A log for
documenting the test results is provided in Table 4.

Prevention
Vulnerability Assessment Guidelines
To facilitate the assessment of vulnerabilities which potentially may exist in [Radio
station], a model Radio Broadcast Vulnerability Assessment Checklist developed by the Media
Security and Reliability Council is provided in Appendix B (Media Security and Reliability
Council, 2005). The Media Security and Reliability Council (“MSRC”) is a Federal Advisory
Committee, formed by the Federal Communications Commission, to study, develop and report
on communications and coordination designed to assure the optimal reliability, robustness and
security of the broadcast and multi-channel video programming distribution industries in
emergency situations.
The checklist is not intended to be comprehensive, and [Radio station] is encouraged
to adapt its use to accommodate any unique requirements which may exist.
The Vulnerability Assessment Checklist should be reviewed and updated as necessary but no
less frequently than annually. The following guidelines are also provided as a tool to help
facilitate the assessment of vulnerabilities which potentially may exist. [Radio station] is
encouraged to review and follow these guidelines:
Redundancies that are planned to provide adequate protection against equipment
failure and even natural disasters are not necessarily the same as those needed to
protect against a deliberate attack. Specifically, protection against deliberate attack
requires security measures at facilities and a combination of both redundancy and
geographic diversity for critical equipment and facilities.
While keeping all aural and data services on the air is most desirable, ensuring that
the aural services remain on the air to serve the community is an absolute necessity.
The focus of prevention considerations should be on facilities that have a role in
originating or delivering news and/or emergency warnings and notices to the public.
Disaster recovery plans should be periodically updated, tested and rehearsed.
11Some capability should exist to obtain news and information in an emergency
situation such as an alternate studio, remote studio or an arrangement to receive
signals from local television and/or cable broadcasters (e.g., ENG/SNG trucks or
satellite links.)
Backup radio and television receiver capabilities should exist for relaying breaking
news and information. The use of DBS receivers is encouraged to provide news and
information during regional widespread emergencies which may affect other local
and regional broadcasters.
In March of 2000, a small brush fire caused the Four Corners Generating Station to
trip off line resulting in a power outage affecting almost the entire state of New Mexico.
While I was on my way to the main studio to start the main generator (fueled by natural
gas and connected to the natural gas main for a virtually unlimited fuel supply in
preparation for Y2K), I tuned across the radio dial and was met with an eerie silence as
every broadcast station within receiver range was off the air. This included FM, AM and
Television stations originating in Albuquerque 130 miles distant! The KTAO radio station
transmitter is entirely solar powered and within 15 minutes after the outage began, KTAO
was back on the air at full power and for about an hour was the only station in North
Central New Mexico that was fully operational. This power outage affected a very large
area and was caused by a relatively small brush fire under a power line.
When completing the Vulnerability Assessment Checklist it is prudent to consider the
location and geographic distribution of key facilities in the market, advances in
mobile or non-mobile broadband Internet near your facilities such as studios, STL
origination sites, transmitter sites and translator locations.
Appropriate measures should be taken to provide redundant, geographically diverse
methods and equipment for delivering program material to the STL, Internet-based
connectivity, transmitter, backup transmitter and translator sites.
Collaboration with other local broadcasters should take place to increase collective
site and equipment diversity, redundancy and interconnections. In times of
emergency, “share the wealth” to ensure that all segments of the community are well
served.
Appropriate measures should be taken to “harden” the broadcast facilities, studios
and transmitter sites, particularly in areas prone to severe weather or natural
disasters.
Appropriate measures should be taken to provide backup power capabilities for all
key facilities, including main studios, STL origination sites, transmitter and translator
sites.
Essential equipment and service suppliers should be examined to ensure that critical
resources will have sufficient capacity and delivery capabilities to meet needs during
an emergency. This is particularly important where fuel for backup generators is
concerned. [Radio station] should consider securing arrangements for fuel
12deliveries from suppliers located outside of the local market during emergency
situations.
Physical security such as chain link fences augmented by security personnel and/or
video surveillance is recommended at all sites critical to the broadcast operation.
Radio broadcasters should have appropriate physical security, augmented by
security personnel and/or video surveillance at their key facilities, including
studios/newsrooms, satellite transmit and receive sites and antenna/transmitter sites.
Radio Broadcasters should employ diverse power grid sources wherever feasible.
Radio broadcasters should take appropriate measures to provide backup power
capabilities for their key facilities, including studios/newsrooms, satellite
communications and transmitters.
Radio broadcasters with local news origination should ensure that they have robust
and redundant ways to communicate with external news services and remote news
teams, such as the use of mobile radio and Internet to augment cell phones.
Radio broadcasters should have backup signal feeds to their primary satellite
transmit and receive sites.
Radio broadcasters should have redundant signal paths to their primary and backup
transmission facilities.
Radio broadcasters with local news origination should plan to have emergency
origination capability at a separate location from their primary studio (e.g., backup
studio, transmitter site, remote van, another station, etc).
Radio broadcasters should plan IT disaster recovery procedures for sourcing
replacement infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls), servers, computers and
software media needed to restore operate the facility or operation. Data services for
communication such as email, Internet access and critical data files should be
coordinated with IT recovery procedures.
Radio broadcasters with local news origination should have a remote vehicle, or
some means of delivering live news and information from a remote site.
Radio broadcasters should have the capability of receiving a remote feed at an
additional site from their primary studio (e.g., directly at their tower site, at a backup
studio, etc).
Radio broadcasters should have a backup satellite transmitter and receiver, or an
alternate means (e.g., a Satellite Radio receiver, a dedicated phone line or a
streaming audio Internet connection) to send and receive signals from and to
national news services in emergency situations.
Radio broadcasters should have a backup transmitter, and should attempt to make
practical arrangements for geographic diversity where possible (e.g., provisions for
13emergency use of other backup transmitter/antenna facilities in the community or
other means).
With the cooperation of federal and local policy makers, all radio broadcasters in a
market should collaborate to increase their collective site diversity and redundancy,
including news studios; operations; satellite transmit/receive facilities and transmitter/
antenna sites.
[Radio station] should coordinate with federal, state and local authorities to ensure
that technical and operations personnel are properly credentialed and recognized so
they can carry out recovery procedures and gain access to essential facilities and
equipment during times of emergencies.
[Radio station] should coordinate with power and communications entities to ensure
that essential facilities and equipment are given an adequate priority level with
respect to repair and recovery schedules.

Personnel Authorized to Declare an Emergency
It is the responsibility of each employee to address emergency situations in accordance
with the DRP in the event that they are aware of a situation that could result in a disruption in
[Radio station] operations and delivery of essential services. An emergency event may not
require that the entire DRP be implemented. Each event should be evaluated on its impact and
severity by the Incident Response Team and Management.
Initial Assessment
These general guidelines should be followed by the individual(s) discovering or
responding to the emergency situation. If possible and time permits, the following assessment
process should occur:
Assess the situation. Consider your safety as a top priority
If applicable, inform co-workers and customers of the situation.
16If necessary, evacuate the facility. Protect vital records and perform emergency
response; i.e., contain fire, power down operations equipment, etc.
When applicable, place calls to obtain the appropriate assistance from local
authorities, i.e., 911, etc.
Document who has been called and their response.
Notify the applicable Incident Response Team member. Be prepared to provide the
following information when applicable, to the personnel that are contacted:
Nature of the emergency, and time of the occurrence.
Extent of damage to facilities.
Current status of the emergency situation including what is being done to confine
or rectify problem.
Resources which may be needed from a Corporate, Division, or Regional offices.
Members of the Incident Response Team who have been contacted.
The local authorities that have been contacted.
The best method to contact you.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and applicable members of the
Incident Response Team will convene to determine a solution and strategy for
recovery.
It is the responsibility of each employee to address emergency situations in accordance
with the DRP in the event he/she is aware of a situation that could result in a disruption in
operations and the delivery of essential services. An emergency event may not require that the
entire plan be implemented. Each event should be evaluated on its impact and severity by the
Incident Response Team, Disaster Recovery Planning Manager or Management.
17Incident Command Center
The ICC is a location or locations identified in the planning process for the Incident
Response Team to operate from in the event of an emergency. The ICC could simply be an
area within the organization’s facilities, such as a conference room or a designated external
location. The ICC will be at the location(s) identified in Table 5.
Table 5: Incident command center location
Primary Address Contact
Locations
Secondary Locations Address Contact
Regardless of where it is located, the ICC should have a backup power source, phones,
radio and television receivers, and any other communication systems as needed including
computers for email and access to the internet. Personnel should be assigned the responsibility
of ensuring that the ICC contains adequate supplies for a 48-72 hour period, and that those
supplies are periodically rotated and maintained. [Radio station] may also wish to consider
acquiring security services for the ICC to protect essential equipment and assets. An example
Inventory Checklist for the ICC is provided in Appendix C:
As you develop plans for your facilities in the event of an emergency, you should
ask yourself what resources will be needed for the next 48-72 hours?
Evacuation Procedures
This section is designed to assist [Radio station] personnel in the creation of an
emergency response process for the protection of life and physical assets in the event of a fire,
explosion, chemical spill or any emergency requiring a facility evacuation. An Emergency
Evacuation Plan (EEP) template for customization by [Radio station] is provided in Appendix
D.
18During the Hurricane Katrina recovery at WQRZ-LP in Bay St. Louis, MS during
September 2005, a situation occurred while Hurricane Rita was affecting the already
devastated area. WQRZ-LP was co-located with the Hancock County Emergency
Operations Center. While WQRZ-LP was receiving a Tornado Warning on the EAS, a fire
alarm was activated in the building because of a faulty air handler motor. Fire Safety
personnel were attempting to evacuate essential radio station personnel while the
announcer was broadcasting a Tornado Warning which included the Hancock County
EOC in the path of the Tornado. This is an example of conflict of authority and
responsibility and situations such as this should be addressed in the planning phase of
the Evacuation Process.
Guidelines:
A site Emergency Evacuation Team should be identified. The team should consist of
an Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, as well as Safety Monitors as appropriate for
each floor of the site with the appropriate number of male and female searchers for
each of the floors in the site.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and Incident Response Team should be
identified as members of this team. Alternates should be assigned as appropriate.
The Emergency Evacuation Team should be cross functional with representation
from other departments such as Security, EHS, On Air, Distribution, Production,
Corporate Communication, Legal, , Network Operations Center (NOC), information
technology (IT)Human Resources, Medical, Facilities, Sourcing and Finance as
applicable.
Floor plans with the evacuation routes and any relevant evacuation information
should be posted on each floor (at several locations on the floor). This information
should also be included in the EEP.
Designate meeting sites at a location outside your site providing sufficient distance to
ensure the safety of personnel and visitors.
Review your operations to determine which critical operating systems may require
continuing attention or shutdown during an evacuation or other emergency situation.
Develop a procedure to ensure that requisite actions are taken during an emergency.
Ensure that you have designated personnel to address these issues, provided them
with the procedure and trained them in its use.
Train the Emergency Evacuation Team on their responsibilities to implement the plan
and to assist in the safe and orderly emergency evacuation of the facilities.
Ensure that you have a procedure in place for communication and evacuation/safe
refuge of disabled persons.
Develop personnel responsibilities lists. Ensure that affected personnel are familiar
with individual and group responsibilities.
Determine methods and procedures for essential recovery personnel, including the
Incident Recovery Team, Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, engineering,
19operations, and technical staff members to communicate their location and status on
a predetermined basis after evacuation occurs.
Develop a training program for distribution and review by personnel.
Coordinate the EEP with the [Radio station] DRP and IRM.
Conduct periodic practice evacuations and evaluate the outcome of those drills.
Update the plan annually.
Key Contacts
Incident Response Team:
The Incident Response Team is a group of employees identified in advance during the
disaster planning process. They are recruited based on their skills and knowledge of the various
operations within the organizations. This team has the responsibility to ascertain the level of
response needed during and emergency, and coordinate the recovery process. These
individuals should also have alternates identified in the event the primary member is not
available to perform their duties. This can be as simple as the General Manager and the
department heads of the facility, with assistant department heads as the alternates.
All members of the Incident Response Team should carry a photo ID or other recognized
credentials in order to carry out recovery procedures and gain access to essential facilities and
equipment during times of emergencies. Members of the Incident Response Team are listed in
Table 6.

Communications
Effective communications can be a challenge during the extreme intensity of a disaster
or emergency situation. Whatever the circumstances, the goal of communications during and
after emergencies will be the rapid and accurate collection and dissemination of information so
that lives may be saved, injuries minimized, fears allayed, and essential services and operations
recovered quickly and effectively
[Radio station] is encouraged to develop and implement a communications strategy in
advance that meets the needs of everyone affected during a disaster or emergency situation.
Consideration should be given to the functions needed to perform in an emergency and the
communications systems needed to support them.
Internal:
During and after emergencies, it will be necessary to communicate with [Radio station]
personnel concerning what actions need to be taken and other vital information. The Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager and Incident Response Team will be the central coordinative link
for such communications. These employees and other personnel involved in recovery
procedures should be equipped with cell phones, two-way radios, satellite phones, ham radios,
text messaging capabilities (e.g., “Blackberries”), or similar devices so that they may
communicate with each other effectively in real time during an emergency. It is critical that
[Radio station] has multiple means of communicating reliably with personnel during an
emergency and not depend upon any single method.
During recovery efforts, essential recovery personnel, including the Incident Recovery
Team, Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and other engineering, operations and technical
staff members should communicate their location and status on predetermined bases.
E-mail may also be an effective means of coordination among the Incident Response
Team before, during and after a disaster or other emergency situation. [Radio station] should
consider creating e-mail distribution lists so that e-mail messages are broadcast to all members
on the lists. Utilize an external email service in the case where internal email is completely
unavailable.” Consider development of an offsite Disaster Portal where people can check in by
entering an update of their own location. These messages could contain notifications about
where to meet, task responsibilities, resources that may be needed or other information
pertaining to the emergency.
25If phones are operative, communications to personnel at home and at work will be
handled by attempting initially to contact personnel directly using the employee contact
information contained in Table 7. In this situation a voice mail system can also be used to inform
personnel of the status of the worksite. If this is unsuccessful or if the phones are not operative,
communications to personnel may be made using two-way radios, satellite phones, ham radios,
e-mail and messenger system,
as deemed appropriate, until such time as the normal phone service resumes. In some cases,
announcements can also be provided to the radio, television, and print media. Personnel should
be informed in advance when ever this type of resource will be utilized and directed to the one
that will be used to provide information about [Radio station].
Effective planning should take into account that personnel will need to know whether
their families are safe during an emergency, and likewise, families will want to know that the
staff member is safe at the facility. However, personnel should refrain from tying up telephone
lines and thereby impeding necessary communications. During an emergency, [Radio station]
may wish to establish a toll-free number, web site or other means for family members to use to
receive a status update.
External:
During an emergency situation, it is critical to communicate quickly, accurately and
perhaps frequently to a variety of external audiences, such as the media, local authorities,
municipalities, federal agencies (e.g., FCC, FEMA, etc.), elected officials, opinion leaders,
customers, and suppliers.
During and after emergencies, these external entities may frequently contact [Radio
station]. These contacts may be general inquiries, requests for sensitive information, requests
for assistance, or they may be for the purpose of exchanging information of mutual interest. To
ensure that communication is ongoing and shared with those entities touched by the
emergency, it is essential that all such contacts be immediately directed to the local Public
Information Officer, Public Affairs staff, Legal department, or other entity serving as the focal
point for these external communications. [Radio station] may also wish to consider activating
emergency alert systems. The Federal Communications Commission encourages broadcast
licensees to transmit emergency alerts as a public service.
To facilitate the gathering of information which may be needed by external entities, a
survey form template is provided in Appendix E. The template is not intended to be
comprehensive and [Radio station] is encouraged to adapt its use to accommodate any unique
situation which may exist.
26Recovery Strategies
All recovery plans should start with an assessment of the vulnerabilities within [Radio
station]. It is the responsibility of the Disaster Recovery Planning Manger to work with [Radio
station] personnel to identify specific risks, threats, incidents or situations that may impact
ongoing system operations, and to define the steps to be taken to prevent (Vulnerability
Assessment), react (Disaster Recovery Plan) and respond (Incident Response Plan), to these
events as they occur. These plans are not meant to be long term restoration efforts, but rather
guidelines to get back on the air as quickly as possible.
After the vulnerability assessments are complete and documented, further planning can
take place to develop strategies and solutions to minimize the vulnerabilities and risks identified,
should they be encountered. It is essential that responsibility for each area of concern be
assigned to qualified personnel. It is also essential that the plan be tested and practiced under
realistic conditions to reveal any weaknesses which may not be initially apparent.
There are nearly an infinite number of natural or man-made disasters or other
emergency situations which could occur including bomb threats, earthquake, fire, flooding, gas
leak, hurricanes, tornados, snow storms, etc. However, while there are any number of situations
which could occur, the associated vulnerabilities and risks can generally be grouped as follows:
The loss of the use of all or critical portions of the facility.
Loss of the transmission facilities.
Loss of access to facilities.
As such, it does not matter why the loss of use or access to a facility occurs. For
example, access to the main facility might be lost due to a hazardous atmosphere, a local law
enforcement action or any number of other emergency situations. What does matter is the
availability of a flexible set of strategies and plans that are well thought out in advance of the
situation. They must be practiced and tested periodically, used alone or in groups, to rapidly
recover from the emergency.
27Problems that [Radio station] could potentially encounter due to an emergency
situation include:
Station On-the-Air / Off-the-Air.
Loss of the transmitter building.
Loss of master control or STL.
Lock down - personnel cannot leave the facilities.
Mandatory evacuations.
Personnel cannot access the facilities or into the building(s).
Transmitter tower issues.
Loss of telephony wired/wireless.
Loss of data networking capabilities.
Loss of communications capabilities to field personnel.
Newsroom computer system failures.
Satellite distribution system failures.
Lawlessness.
Below are just two examples of the many guidelines and procedures you will need for
proper planning in the event of these types of problems. [Radio station] is encouraged to
define additional guidelines and procedures to accommodate additional, as well as any locally
unique, emergency situations using similar forms in this section. Planning for different
geographic locations is also required. Planning for earthquakes in Southern California is a
requirement, but planning for snow storms is not.

31Appendix A: Pandemic Preparedness
Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and OSHA
have developed guidelines, including checklists, to assist businesses, industries, and other
employers in planning for a pandemic outbreak. This document will reference their
recommendations and provide links to the plans developed by these organizations. Pandemic
preparedness should be part of every disaster recovery plan.
From the OSHA documentation:
To reduce the impact of a pandemic on your operations, employees and the general public, it is
important for all businesses and organizations to include continuity planning for a pandemic.
Lack of continuity planning can result in a cascade of failures as employers attempt to address
challenges of a pandemic with insufficient resources and employees who might not be
adequately trained in the jobs they will be asked to perform. Proper planning will allow
employers to better protect their employees and prepare for changing patterns of commerce
and potential disruptions in supplies or services.
Develop a disaster plan that includes pandemic preparedness, review it regularly and conduct
drills.
▪ Be aware of and review federal, state and local health department pandemic influenza
plans. Incorporate appropriate actions from these plans into workplace disaster plans.
▪ Prepare and plan for operations with a reduced workforce.
▪ Work with your suppliers to ensure that you can continue to operate and provide
services.
▪ Develop a sick leave policy that does not penalize sick employees, thereby encouraging
employees to stay home so that they do not infect other employees. Recognize that
employees with ill family members may need to stay home to care for them.
▪ Identify possible exposure and health risks to your employees. Are your employees
expected to have a lot of contact with the general public?
▪ Minimize exposure to fellow employees or the public. For example, will more of your
employees work from home? This may require enhancement of technology and
communications equipment.
▪ Identify business-essential positions and people required to sustain business-necessary
functions and operations. Prepare to cross-train or develop ways to function in the
absence of these positions. It is recommended that employers train three or more
employees to be able to sustain business-necessary functions and operations, and
communicate the expectation for available employees to perform these functions if
needed during a pandemic.
▪ Plan for downsizing services but also anticipate any scenario which may require a surge
in your services.
▪ Recognize that, in the course of normal daily life, all employees will have non-
occupational risk factors at home and in community settings that should be reduced to
the extent possible. Some employees will also have individual risk factors that should
be considered by employers as they plan how the organization will respond to a
potential pandemic (e.g., immuno-compromised individuals and pregnant women).
▪ Stockpile items such as soap, tissue, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and
recommended personal protective equipment. When stockpiling items, be aware of
each product's shelf life and storage conditions. Make sure that your disaster plan
protects and supports your employees, customers and the general public. Be aware of
your employees' concerns about pay, leave, safety and health. Informed employees who
32feel safe at work are less likely to be absent.
▪ Develop policies and practices that distance employees from each other, customers and
the general public. Consider practices to minimize face-to-face contact between
employees such as e-mail, websites and teleconferences. Policies and practices that
allow employees to work from home or to stagger their work shifts may be important
as absenteeism rises.
▪ Work with your employees and their union(s) to address leave, pay, transportation,
travel, childcare, absence and other human resource issues.
▪ Provide your employees and customers in your workplace with easy access to infection
control supplies, such as soap, hand sanitizers, personal protective equipment (such
as gloves or surgical masks), tissues, and office cleaning supplies.
▪ Provide training, education and informational material about business-essential job
functions and employee health and safety, including proper hygiene practices and the
use of any personal protective equipment to be used in the workplace. Be sure that
informational material is available in a usable format for individuals with sensory
disabilities and/or limited English proficiency. Encourage employees to take care of
their health by eating right, getting plenty of rest and getting a seasonal flu
vaccination.
▪ Work with your insurance companies, and state and local health agencies to provide
information to employees and customers about medical care in the event of a
pandemic.
Assist employees in managing additional stressors related to the pandemic. These are likely to
include distress related to personal or family illness, life disruption, grief related to loss of family,
friends or coworkers, loss of routine support systems, and similar challenges. Assuring timely
and accurate communication will also be important throughout the duration of the pandemic in
decreasing fear or worry. Employers should provide opportunities for support, counseling, and
mental health assessment and referral should these be necessary. If present, Employee
Assistance Programs can offer training and provide resources and other guidance on mental
health and resiliency before and during a pandemic.

33Appendix B: Incident Response Manual
The objective of the Incident Response Team manual is to ensure that critical contact
information necessary to ensure the timely resumption of service is available quickly to the
Incident Response Team in the event of an emergency. The contents of this manual are
included in the [Radio station] DRP in various locations and sections are duplicated here. It is
intended that the Incident Response Manual be carried by team members at all times.
Questions and/or suggestions concerning this manual should be directed to the Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager.
The following information is currently included in this Manual:

43Section I: Purpose and Objectives
Potential emergencies at [Radio station] such as fire, explosion, hazardous material
spill, chemical releases and all other emergency situations may require personnel to evacuate a
facility. An EEP and adequate occupant familiarity with a facility minimize threats to life and
property. This plan applies to all emergencies where personnel may need to evacuate for
personal safety.
This EEP is intended to communicate the policies and procedures for personnel to follow
in an emergency situation. This written plan should be made available, upon request, to
personnel and their designated representatives by the Emergency Evacuation Coordinator for
the facility.
Under this plan, personnel will be informed of:
The plan's purpose.
Preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies.
Emergency escape procedures and route assignments.
Procedures to be followed by personnel who remain to control critical plant
operations before they evacuate.
Procedures to account for all personnel after an emergency evacuation has been
completed.
Rescue and medical duties for those staff members who perform them.
The alarm system.
[Name/title] is the Emergency Evacuation Coordinator for this facility and has overall
responsibility for the preparation and implementation of this plan.
[Name/title] is the Alternate Emergency Evacuation Coordinator.
The Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, in coordination with the Disaster Recovery
Planning Manager, will review and update the plan as necessary. Copies of this plan will be
maintained in/at: [location]
Section II: General Guidelines
The following guidelines apply to this EEP:
All personnel should be trained in safe evacuation procedures. Refresher training is
required whenever the employee's responsibilities or designated actions under the
plan change, and whenever the plan itself is changed.
The training may include use of floor plans and workplace maps which clearly show
the emergency escape routes included in the EEP. Color-coding aids personnel in
44determining their route assignments. Floor plans and maps should be posted at all
times in main areas (i.e., stairwells, lobbies, elevator lobbies, exit corridors) of
[Radio station] to provide guidance in an emergency.
Stairwells are the primary means for evacuation. Elevators are to be used only when
authorized by a fire or police officer.
Personnel will not be permitted to re-enter the facility until advised by the Fire
Department.
This EEP will be coordinated with efforts in connected facilities. Mutually beneficial
agreements can be reached regarding designated meeting sites and shelter in the event of
inclement weather.
Section III: Responsibilities of Emergency Evacuation Coordinator
and Safety Monitors
The Emergency Evacuation Coordinator is responsible for:
Obtaining and posting floor plans and route evacuation maps.
Overseeing the development, communication, implementation and maintenance of
the overall EEP.
Ensuring the training of occupants, Safety Monitors, and critical operations
personnel, and notifying all personnel of changes to the plan.
Maintaining up to date lists of occupants, critical operations personnel, and any other
personnel with assigned duties under this plan.
In the event of an emergency, relaying applicable information to the Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager, building occupants and Safety Monitors.
Establishing designated meeting sites for evacuees.
In coordination with the Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, assist in posting the
EEP in work areas, communicating plan to occupants, and updating the plan
annually.
The Safety Monitors are responsible for:
Assisting in familiarizing personnel with emergency evacuation procedures.
Acting as liaison between management, the Disaster Recovery Planning Manager,
and the Incident Response Team, and their work area.
Ensuring that occupants have vacated the premise in the event of an evacuation and
for checking assigned areas.
Knowing where their designated meeting site is and for communicating this
information to building occupants.
45Having a list of personnel in their area of coverage to facilitate a head count at their
designated meeting site.
Ensuring that disabled persons and visitors are assisted in evacuating the facility.
Evaluating and reporting problems to the Emergency Evacuation Coordinator after
an emergency event.
Section IV: Alerting Occupants in Case of Fire or Other Emergency
In case of a fire, personnel should activate the nearest fire alarm box and/or contact
the local fire department. Fire alarm box locations are noted on the evacuation floor
plans in Section X. The alarm will serve as an alert to building occupants for the
need to evacuate.
It may be necessary to activate additional fire alarm boxes or shout the alarm if
people are still in the facility and the alarm has stopped sounding or if the alarm does
not sound. This can be done while exiting.
Persons discovering a fire, smoky condition, or explosion should pull the fire alarm
box. Any pertinent fire or rescue information should be conveyed to the Fire
Department. All emergency telephone numbers are listed at the beginning of this
EEP.
State your name, your location, and the nature of the call. Speak slowly and clearly.
Wait for the dispatcher to hang up first. On occasion the dispatcher may need
additional information or may provide you with additional instructions.
Section V: Evacuation Procedures for Facility Occupants
When the fire alarm sounds, all personnel should ensure that nearby personnel are
aware of the emergency, quickly shutdown operating equipment, close doors, and
exit the facility using stairwells.
All occupants should proceed to their Designated Meeting Site and await further
instructions from their Safety Monitor, Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager, or Incident Response Team member.
All personnel should know where primary and alternate exits are located and be
familiar with the various available evacuation routes. Floor plans with escape routes,
alternate escape routes, exit locations and designated meeting sites are located in
Section X and are posted in the facility.
Occupants should NOT use elevators as an escape route in the event of a fire.
46Notes and precautions:
Small fires can be extinguished more effectively if you are trained to use a fire
extinguisher. However, an immediate readiness to evacuate is essential.
All fires, even those that have been extinguished, should be reported to the local fire
department immediately.
Never enter a room that is smoke filled.
Never enter a room if the door is warm to touch.
R - Rescue: When you discover a fire, rescue people in immediate danger if you can
do so without endangering yourself. Exit via a safe fire exit. Never use elevators.
Close doors to rooms with fire.
A - Alarm: Sound the alarm by pulling a fire box and call 911 from a safe distance to
notify fire command center of precise location of fire.
C - Confine: Close all doors, windows and other openings.
E - Evacuate: Evacuate the facility.
Section VI: Disabled Occupants
If a disabled occupant is unable to exit the facility unassisted, the Safety Monitor should
notify the emergency response personnel of the individual’s location. Transporting of disabled
individuals up or down stairwells should be avoided until emergency response personnel have
arrived. Unless imminent life-threatening conditions exist in the immediate area occupied by a
non-ambulatory or disabled person, relocation of the individual should be limited to a safe area
on the same floor, in close proximity to an evacuation stairwell.
Section VII: On-Air Operations
Critical operations, including equipment that should be shut off or set-up to operate
unattended, and persons designated to complete these actions are identified in Table 1.
Procedures for these transition activities should be predetermined for life safety and loss control
purposes, as well as ensuring complete evacuations in a timely manner.
47Table 1: Critical operations
Operation Required Transition Name Contact
Office:
Home:

The shutdown procedure to be followed by those employees who have been assigned to
care for essential [Radio station] operations include: On-air; News Studio Operations; News
Gathering; Sales and Human Resources.
Individuals involved in these transition procedures should be notified by management of
this responsibility in advance. They should be identified in the EEP, and appropriately trained for
the particular situation. Of course alternate personnel should to be identified as well.
Section VIII: Accountability Procedures for Emergency Evacuation
Groups working together on or in the same area should meet outside and away from the
facility in the prearranged designated meeting site. A list of the primary and alternate designated
meeting sites is listed on the floor plans in Section X.
A roster of personnel to ensure that everyone has evacuated has been developed by the
Emergency Evacuations Coordinator. The list will be updated whenever there is a personnel
change.
Safety Monitors are designated by the Emergency Coordinator and/or the Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager and will conduct head counts once evacuation has been
completed. There should be at least one Safety Monitor per floor or per twenty occupants to
provide adequate guidance and instruction at the time of an emergency.
Personnel selected as Safety Monitors are to be trained in the complete workplace
layout and the various primary and alternate escape routes from the workplace. All trained
personnel are made aware of employees with disabilities who may need extra assistance and of
hazardous areas to be avoided during emergencies. Before leaving, the Safety Monitors are to
check rooms and other enclosed spaces in the workplace for other staff members who may be
trapped or otherwise unable to evacuate the area, and convey this information to emergency
personnel. A list of Safety Monitors and Alternate Safety Monitors for [Radio station] appears
in Table 2.

viIntroduction
The core of this document is the result of the Media Security and Reliability
Council which was chartered by the FCC to prepare a comprehensive national
strategy for securing and sustaining broadcast facilities throughout the United
States during attacks, natural disasters and all other threats nationwide.
Changes in technology required that this document be updated for The
Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council to assure optimal
reliability, robustness and security. As of this date the MSRC I and MSRC II
documents can be found at http://www.mediasecurity.org.
Disaster recovery planning is a practical approach to contingency and risk
management designed to reduce the consequences associated with an extended
disruption of essential services. The scope of this document is to provide
guidelines to develop a short term Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) and Incident
Response Manual (IRM) (Appendix A) for use as a tool by your organization for
the timely resumption of essential services in emergency situations. Long-term
Disaster Recovery plans, and business recovery issues, while important, are
beyond the scope of this document. This document is generic in nature, and is
designed to serve as a template. [Cable system] is encouraged to adapt its use
to accommodate any unique requirements that may exist.
As you formulate your disaster recovery plans you should ask yourself what
you would do in the event your facility and all of the day-to-day operational
resources you use were no longer available.
1Objectives
Figure 1 shows the basic disaster recovery planning steps that should be followed
in order to ensure that the timely recovery of essential services is initiated in the
event of an emergency situation.
Prepare Develop
Assess recovery and restoration
Identify essential services procedures to ensure
required in an emergency essential services
continue in an emergency
Recover Respond
Recover essential services When an incident
Evaluate recovery processes or testing occurs – use
Revise procedures recovery procedures to
respond
Figure 1: Basic Recovery Planning Steps
2The objective of this document is to provide guidelines and strategies that
will allow [Cable system] to effectively accomplish these steps by assessing the
vulnerability and impact to critical systems, and to recover operations and
essential services in the event of a disruption caused by a natural or man-made
disaster or other emergency situations in an organized and efficient manner. To
meet these objectives the DRP should address the following major topics:
Vulnerability assessment and prevention.
Plan distribution and maintenance.
Staff roles and responsibilities.
Essential equipment, materials and services.
Internal and external communications.
Recovery strategies and procedures.
Periodic plan testing.
In the event of an incident, it is essential to ensure that proper levels of
notification and communication regarding the event are disseminated to personnel,
emergency services and other stakeholders.
It should be recognized that any plan should be flexible enough to be
adapted to the particular emergency situation. The key to recovering from an
emergency situation, with minimum impact, is to have a DRP and to follow it.
3Requirements
When developing the DRP guidelines, the following requirements should be
met:
All processes critical to the continuation of essential services should
be identified.
Critical personnel should be identified and receive the plan.
The plan should be reviewed no less than annually
The plan should be tested.
Availability of emergency information to the deaf and hard of hearing.
Availability of emergency information to non-English speaking
persons.
Establish and maintain lines of communication with industry and
governmental forums assisting with DRP (e.g. NCC, ESF2, NRSC,
ATIS)

• Distribution Copy #4 – A copy of the DRP should be kept at a secure
off-site location.
• Distribution Copy #5 – When applicable, a copy of the DRP
should reside at a Division or Corporate office.
• Distribution Copy #6 – Two copies of the DRP should reside at the
Incident Command Center (ICC) (see Table 5).
7The DRP contains proprietary company information and is not for general
distribution. Each individual possessing a copy is responsible for
maintaining it in a secure location, and in accordance with company policies
for the protection of proprietary information. The Disaster Recovery
Planning Manager is responsible for maintaining the DRP in an updated
condition and distributing the revised document whenever the DRP is
updated.
DRP Maintenance
This section describes the procedures for maintaining the DRP.
Maintenance procedures consist of two general categories: scheduled and
unscheduled. Scheduled maintenance is time-driven, where unscheduled
maintenance is event-driven.
Scheduled Maintenance
Scheduled maintenance consists of a scheduled annual review and updates
as well as an annual structured walkthrough and tactical exercises.
Scheduled maintenance occurs as the result of a scheduled review of the
plans. Reviews are predictable and are scheduled not less than annually. The
purpose of the review is to determine whether changes are required to strategies,
tasks, notifications and assembly procedures.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for initiating
Scheduled Maintenance activities. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager
should initiate reviews twice yearly. The Incident Response Team and their
alternates should review the strategies and procedures for changes that may be
required. The reviews should address events that have occurred within each team
members’ area of responsibility that may affect prevention, response, and
recovery capability.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for any required
updates to the DRP that results from the review. The Disaster Recovery Planning
Manager should import all changes to the master hard copy, print hard copies of
the plan, redistribute the copies as described above, and ensure that all issued
copies are updated to the same level as the master hard copy.
8Ongoing consideration should be given to how the DRP will be maintained
and stored in a secure and reliable manner. The DRP should be available to
the key personnel under all circumstances.
Unscheduled Maintenance
Certain maintenance requirements are unpredictable and cannot be
scheduled. The majority of these unscheduled plan changes occur as the result of
major changes to hardware or software, network configurations, personnel
changes, etc. The following are examples of items that may trigger the need for
unscheduled maintenance:
Significant modifications in the physical plant (i.e., changes in equipment or
equipment locations, network operating software, changes to signal routing,
changes in IT based local area or wide are networking connectivity etc.).
Changes in on-site and off-site storage facilities (i.e. Parts and equipment
storage lockers, sheds, closets….think about both physical and data
storage).
Changes in major operations facilities (i.e. Headend, Hub, NOC, etc.).
Significant modification of business or operational support systems (i.e.
Traffic and billing systems, Conditional access systems, etc. Anything that
integrates with and affects day-to-day technical operations).
Transfers, terminations, promotions, personnel relocations (i.e. home
telephone and/or cell telephone number changes) or resignations of
individuals from the Incident Response Team.
Recent acquisition of or merger with another company.
Textual alert delivery that relies on IT specific resources or IP integration
with 3rd party delivery mechanisms
9DRP Testing
This section describes the procedures for periodically testing the DRP.
Responsibility for Establishing Testing Scenarios
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and the Technology Manager
(Title will vary depending on the company such as Chief Engineer, Director of
Engineering, etc. should meet with all department heads named in the Master
Distribution list to develop testing for each department. For example, the Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager and the Lead Maintenance Technician should meet
to identify all critical system power supplies and compose testing scenarios for
each.
At first, a block diagram of all major subsystems can be developed, then as
the plan matures; smaller subsystems can be included in the testing scenarios.
The input of all affected parties, including non-technical personnel should
be requested so that routine tasks essential to the normal operations of the system
are not overlooked.
While conducting DRP testing, it is essential to carefully document events
as they occur during the test, noting unexpected, unusual or abnormal systems
operation. Be aware of the amount of time and stress factors involved in carrying
out DRP testing scenarios. It is recommended that an engineering staff member or
assistant be assigned the task of keeping a log during the test. This will be of
assistance during the review of the test to refine and improve performance in
subsequent testing.
Scope and Type of Plan Testing
Conducting periodic tests of the DRP is encouraged to ensure that plans
meet the recovery needs defined by the organization. These tests should be
structured so as to be realistic without disrupting the normal business process.
Testing should be planned, organized and conducted in such a way that results
can be documented, verified, and evaluated.
Disasters can happen in many ways, some unimaginable and
unforeseeable. Developing a testing scenario for each and every disaster may not
be possible. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should make every effort to
identify all types of disasters likely to occur in their locality and then imagine other
10disasters that may occur, though only rarely. All disaster testing scenarios should
be based on worst-case conditions.
During the testing of the DRP it may not be possible to duplicate the actual
conditions of a disaster for test purposes. For example, while conducting a test of
the DRP for a complete evacuation of a facility, say for a bomb threat, the actual
physical evacuation of personnel and customers may not be practical because of
the business disruption that will result from the test.
For some testing a simulation can be used. For example, if the test for that
day is a complete building evacuation; non- critical personnel can assemble
at their assigned meeting point, or, if the facility is in a high-rise building, a
simulated assembly area might be the elevator lobby on the tested floor. The
testing team would then interview the staff to make certain they know what
procedures to follow in the event of an actual building evacuation.
Structured Walkthrough
A structured walkthrough is the first step in developing a testing strategy
and may consist of gathering department heads and touring the facility to identify
critical areas of concern. Each department head can identify the critical systems in
their area of responsibility while noting comments from others about inter-
operability issues. A priority list of testing of all major systems and subsystems
can then be developed.
Site- Specific Exercise
Some locations may require site-specific exercises. The plans and testing
for the main facilities may not work for other locations. Testing and planning
needs to be customized for all locations.
Schedule of Plan Testing
It is recommended that a schedule be developed for testing each critical
system and subsystem. For example, the “power failure at essential facilities” test
might be scheduled during the night to avoid potential interruption of essential
services. Critical systems should be tested more often than ancillary subsystems.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager may require “damage to essential
facilities” testing every three months, while “damage to physical plant” testing may
be performed only once or twice per year. The DRP in its entirety should be
reviewed no less than annually.
Some testing, for example, emergency generator power systems, should be
done regularly, and tested annually with all power fully disconnected from the utility
power grid. This will verify that all critical systems are connected to the correct
emergency backup power supply.
11Plan Testing Announcements
Announcements of major system and subsystem testing should be given far
enough in advance to allow for proper steps to be taken in preparation for the test.
For example, if the Headend’s backup generator is to be tested, engineering
personnel should make sure that all critical systems are fully backed up and
redundant. Steps should be taken in case the tested system fails the scheduled
test to make sure that there are no unplanned interruptions to essential services.
In a typical environment, a 7 to 10 day advance notice of DRP plan testing should
be sufficient.
After the DRP is developed, consideration should be given to preparing an
annual schedule of systems and subsystems testing. This will assist engineering
personnel in planning maintenance tasks and upgrades to either coincide with or
avoid DRP testing parameters.
In the event of an actual disaster, it is critical that a complete event log be
kept to allow for a later review of recovery efforts and any changes that may
improve those procedures.
Test Scenarios
When composing the test scenario, consideration should be given to the
complexity of the test, how much time it will take to perform the test, how much
time it will take to properly de-brief and evaluate the test, and the general impact of
the test on normal day to day operations of the facility. Also, if the test includes
change out of equipment and/or changes to normal signal path routing, care
should taken to restore the tested system to pre-test configuration. It is
recommended that careful system configuration notes and photos be taken before
the test is conducted to ensure that the system can be restored to normal
operations.
12Evaluation of Plan Testing
As each segment of the DRP is tested, an evaluation should be conducted
to identify problem areas in both the testing scenario and the recovery strategy.
The following questions will help serve as a guide for evaluating the efficacy of the
conducted tests:
• Did the testing run smoothly?
• Did the test run through all the steps to conclusion?
• Is the test practical?
• Does the test show that the planned recovery strategy is functional?
• Does the test interfere with other systems or departments not
included in the test?
• Does the test interfere with the delivery of services?
• At the conclusion of the test was a return to normal operations easily
accomplished?
After completion of the test a series of meetings should be held with the
affected departments, as well as the Incident Response Team, Emergency
Evacuation Team in order to compile observations, comments, and criticisms and
give each participant a chance to recommend if necessary changes to the plan.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should then update the plan and
redistribute the revised plan.
It may be necessary to re-test the same segment of the plan multiple times
before all concerned departments agree upon a testing protocol. Proper planning,
testing and implementation of recovery strategies will facilitate a fast and complete
return to “normal” operations during an emergency.
Remember, it is much easier to solve problems in the light of day than in the
fog of war.
Plan Testing History
DRP testing should be carefully documented to provide a complete record
of events as the plan is maintained and updated. The plan testing history will then
provide an accurate record of test results, evaluations and updates as well as a
record of when each test segment of the plan was carried out.
13The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager can use the test history as a tool
to determine what changes may have occurred if a test suddenly no longer works.
A log for documenting the test results is provided in Table 4.

Prevention
Vulnerability Assessment Guidelines
To facilitate the assessment of vulnerabilities that potentially may exist in
[Cable system], a model Cable System Vulnerability Assessment Checklist
developed by the Media Security and Reliability Council is provided in Appendix B
(Media Security and Reliability Council, 2005). The Media Security and Reliability
Council (“MSRC”) is a Federal Advisory Committee, formed by the Federal
Communications Commission, to study, develop and report on communications
and coordination designed to assure the optimal reliability, robustness and security
of the broadcast and multi-channel video programming distribution industries in
emergency situations.
The checklist is not intended to be comprehensive, and [Cable system] is
encouraged to adapt its use to accommodate any unique requirements that may
exist. The Vulnerability Assessment Checklist should be reviewed and updated as
necessary but no less frequently than annually.
The following guidelines are also provided as a tool to help facilitate the
assessment of vulnerabilities that potentially may exist. [Cable system] is
encouraged to review and follow these guidelines:
• Redundancies that are planned to provide adequate protection
against equipment failure and even natural disasters are not
necessarily the same as those needed to protect against a deliberate
attack. Specifically, protection against deliberate attack requires
security measures at facilities and a combination of both redundancy
and geographic diversity for critical equipment and facilities.
14• Disaster recovery plans should be periodically updated, tested and
rehearsed.
• Vulnerability assessments should consider the location and
geographic distribution of key facilities in the market, such as
Headends and Hubs.
• Cable operators in a region should collaborate, where possible, to
increase their collective site and equipment diversity, redundancy
and interconnections.
• Cable systems and local broadcasters in a region should work jointly to
develop prevention plans and to improve the redundancies in their
interconnections.
Cable systems should plan IT disaster recovery procedures for sourcing
replacement infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls), servers,
computers and software media needed to restore, operate the facility of
operation. Data services for communication such as e-mail, Internet
access, and critical data files should be coordinated with IT recovery.
Appropriate measures to be taken to provide redundant and
geographically diverse equipment for their Headend, Hub, Internet-
based connectivity, and plant facilities, appropriate to the system’s
operations and facilities. Operations and facilities operations and
facilities
Redundant signal routes should extend as far out in the network as
economically practical.
Where economically feasible, the physical plant should be appropriately
“hardened,” particularly in areas prone to severe weather or natural
disasters.
Essential equipment and service suppliers should be examined to
ensure that critical resources would have sufficient capacity and delivery
capabilities to meet needs during an emergency. This is particularly
important where fuel for backup generators is concerned. [Cable
system] should consider securing arrangements for fuel deliveries from
suppliers located outside of the local market during emergency
situations.
15[Cable system] should coordinate with federal, state and local
authorities to ensure that technical and operations personnel are
properly credentialed and recognized so they can carry out recovery
procedures and gain access to essential facilities and equipment during
times of emergencies. Of emergencies of emergencies of emergencies
[Cable system] should coordinate with power and communications
entities to ensure that essential facilities and equipment are given an
adequate priority level with respect to repair and recovery schedules.
[Cable system] should use available resources to notify subscribers
of estimated recovery times.
[Cable system] should establish plans to communication status to
local, state, and federal entities.

Personnel Authorized to Declare an Emergency
It is the responsibility of each employee to address emergency situations in
accordance with the DRP in the event that they are aware of a situation that could
result in a disruption in [Cable system] operations and delivery of essential
services. An emergency event may not require that the entire DRP be
implemented. The Incident Response Team and Management should evaluate
each event on its impact and severity.
19Initial Assessment
The individual(s) discovering or responding to the emergency situation
should follow these general guidelines. If possible and time permits, the following
assessment process should occur:
• Assess the situation. Consider your safety a top priority.
• If applicable, inform co-workers and customers of the situation.
• If necessary, evacuate the facility. Protect vital records and perform
emergency response; i.e. contain fire, power down operations
equipment, etc.
• When applicable, place calls to obtain the appropriate assistance
from local authorities, i.e., 911, etc.
• Document who has been called and their response.
• Notify the applicable Incident Response Team member. Be
prepared to provide the following information, when applicable, to the
personnel that are contacted:
• Nature of the emergency, and time of the occurrence.
• Extent of damage to facilities and/or plant.
• Current status of the emergency situation including what is being
done to confine or rectify problem.
• Resources which may be needed from a Corporate, Division, or
Regional office.
• Members of the Incident Response Team who have been contacted.
• The local authorities that have been contacted.
• The best method to contact you.
• The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and applicable members
of the Incident Response Team will convene to determine a
solution and strategy for recovery.
20It is the responsibility of each employee to address emergency
situations in accordance with the DRP in the event he/she is aware of a
situation that could result in a disruption in operations and the delivery of
essential services. An emergency event may not require that the plan
be implemented. The Incident Response Team, Disaster Recovery
Planning Manager, or Management should evaluate each event on its
impact and severity.
Incident Command Center
The ICC is a location or locations identified in the planning process
for the Incident Response Team to operate from in the event of an
emergency. The ICC could simply be an area within the organization’s
facilities, such as a conference room, or a designated external location.
The ICC will be at the location(s) identified in Table 5.
Table 5: Incident Command Center Location
Primary Address Contact
Locations
Secondary Locations Address Contact
Regardless of where it is located, the ICC should have a backup power
source, phones, radio and television receivers, and any other communication
systems as needed including computers for email and access to the Internet.
Personnel should be assigned the responsibility of ensuring that the ICC contains
adequate supplies for a 48-72 hour period, and that those supplies are periodically
rotated and maintained. [Cable system] may also wish to consider acquiring
security services for the ICC to protect essential equipment and assets. An
example Inventory Checklist for the ICC is provided in Appendix C:
As you develop plans for your facilities in the event of an emergency, you
should ask yourself what resources would be needed for the next 48-72
hours?
21Evacuation Procedures
This section is designed to assist [Cable system] personnel in the creation
of an emergency response process for the protection of life and physical assets in
the event of a fire, explosion, chemical spill or any emergency requiring a facility
evacuation. An Emergency Evacuation Plan (EEP) template for customization by
[Cable system] is provided in Appendix D.
Guidelines
• A site Emergency Evacuation Team should be identified. The team
should consist of an Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, as well as
Safety Monitors as appropriate for each floor of the site with the
appropriate number of male and female searchers for each of the
floors in the site. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and
Incident Response Team should be identified as members of this
team. Alternates should be assigned as appropriate.
• The Emergency Evacuation Team should be cross functional with
representation from other departments such as Advertising,
Communication, Construction, Customer Support, Facilities, Human
Resources, Installation, Legal, Network Operations Center (NOC),
information technology (IT), Marketing, Technical, Warehouse.
• Floor plans with the evacuation routes and any relevant evacuation
information should be posted on each floor (at several locations on
the floor). This information should also be included in the EEP.
• Designate meeting sites at a location outside your site providing
sufficient distance to ensure the safety of personnel and visitors.
• Review your operations to determine which critical operating systems
may require continuing attention or shutdown during an evacuation
or other emergency situation. Develop a procedure to ensure that
requisite actions are taken during an emergency. Ensure that you
have designated personnel to address these issues, provided them
with the procedure, and trained them in its use.
• Train the Emergency Evacuation Team on their responsibilities to
implement the plan and to assist in the safe and orderly emergency
evacuation of the facilities.
• Ensure that you have a procedure in place for communication and
evacuation/safe refuge of disabled persons.
22• Develop personnel responsibilities lists. Ensure that affected
personnel are familiar with individual and group responsibilities.
• Determine methods and procedures for essential recovery
personnel, including the Incident Recovery Team, Disaster Recovery
Planning Manager, engineering, operations, and technical staff
members to communicate their location and status on predetermined
bases after evacuation occurs.
• Develop a training program for distribution and review by personnel.
• Coordinate the EEP with the [Cable system] DRP and IRM.
• Conduct periodic practice evacuations and evaluate the outcome of
those drills.
• Update the plan annually.
Key Contacts
Incident Response Team
The Incident Response Team is a group of employees identified in advance
during the disaster planning process. They are recruited based on their skills and
knowledge of the various operations within the organizations. This team has the
responsibility to ascertain the level of response needed during an emergency, and
coordinate the recovery process. These individuals should also have alternates
identified in the event the primary member is not available to perform their duties.
This can be as simple as the General Manager and the department heads of the
facility, with assistant department heads as the alternates. All members of the
Incident Response Team should carry a photo ID or other recognized credentials
in order to carry out recovery procedures and gain access to essential facilities
and equipment during times of emergencies.
23Members of the Incident Response Team are listed in Table 6.

28Communications
Effective communications can be a challenge during the extreme intensity
of a disaster or emergency situation. Whatever the circumstances, the goal of
communications during and after emergencies will be the rapid and accurate
collection and dissemination of information so that lives may be saved, injuries
minimized, fears allayed, and essential services and operations recovered quickly
and effectively.
[Cable system] is encouraged to develop and implement a communications
strategy in advance that meets the needs of everyone affected during a disaster or
emergency situation. Consideration should be given to the functions needed to
perform in an emergency and the communications systems needed to support
them.
Internal
During and after emergencies, it will be necessary to communicate with [Cable
system] personnel concerning what actions need to be taken and other vital
information. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and Incident Response
Team will be the central coordinative link for such communications. These
employees and other personnel involved in recovery procedures should be
equipped with cell phones, two-way radios, satellite phones, ham radios, text
messaging capabilities (e.g., “Blackberries”), or similar devices so that they may
communicate with each other effectively in real time during an emergency. It is
critical that [Cable system] has multiple means of communicating reliably with
personnel during an emergency and not depend upon any single method.
During recovery efforts, essential recovery personnel, including the Incident
Recovery Team, Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, and other engineering,
operations, and technical staff members should communicate their location and
status on predetermined bases.
E-mail may also be an effective means of coordination among the Incident
Response Team before, during and after and disaster, or other emergency
situation. [Cable system] should consider creating e-mail distribution lists so that
e-mail messages are broadcast to all members of the lists. Utilize an external
email service in the case where internal email is completely unavailable. Consider
development of an offsite Disaster Portal where people can check in by entering
an update of their own location. These messages could contain notifications about
where to meet, task responsibilities, resources that may be needed or other
information pertaining to the emergency.
29If phones are operative, communications to personnel at home and at work will be
handled by attempting initially to contact personnel directly using the employee
contact information contained in Table 7. In this situation a voice mail system can
also be used to inform personnel of the status of the worksite. If this is
unsuccessful, or if the phones are not operative, communications to personnel
may be made using two-way radios, satellite phones, ham radios, e-mail, and
messenger system as deemed appropriate, until such time as the normal phone
service resumes. In some cases, announcements can also be provided to the
radio, television, and print media. Personnel should be informed in advance
whenever this type of resource will be utilized and directed to the one that will be
used to provide information about [Cable system].
Effective planning should take into account that personnel will need to know
whether their families are safe during an emergency, and likewise, families will
want to know that the staff member is safe at the facility. However, personnel
should refrain from tying up telephone lines and thereby impeding necessary
communications. During an emergency, [Cable system] may wish to establish a
toll-free number, web site or other means for family members to use to receive a
status update.
External
During an emergency situation, it is critical to communicate quickly,
accurately and perhaps frequently to a variety of external audiences, such as the
media, local authorities and municipalities, including franchise authorities, federal
agencies (e.g., FCC, FEMA, etc.) elected officials, opinion leaders, customers, and
suppliers. Complete mandatory and voluntary reports for entities such as public
utility commissions, Federal Communications Commission (NORS outage reports
and DIRS).
During and after emergencies, these external entities may frequently
contact [Cable system]. These contacts may be general inquiries, requests for
sensitive information, requests for assistance, or may be for the purpose of
exchanging information of mutual interest. To ensure that communication is
ongoing and shared with those entities touched by the emergency, it is essential
that all such contacts be immediately directed to the local Public Information
Officer, Public Affairs staff, Legal department, or other entity serving as the focal
point for these external communications.
30[Cable system] may also wish to consider placing messages pertaining to
the emergency situation on voice mail or Automated Response Units so that the
public can access information pertaining to the emergency situation, and consider
activating emergency alert systems. The Federal Communications Commission
encourages cable operators to transmit emergency alerts as a public service.
To facilitate the gathering of information that may be needed by external
entities, a survey form template is provided in Appendix E. The template is not
intended to be comprehensive, and [Cable system] is encouraged to adapt its use
to accommodate any unique situation that may exist.
Recovery Strategies
All recovery plans should start with an assessment of the vulnerabilities
within [Cable system]. It is the responsibility of the Disaster Recovery Planning
Manager to work with [Cable system] personnel to identify specific risks, threats,
incidents or situations that may impact ongoing system operations, and to define
the steps to be taken to prevent (Vulnerability Assessment), react (Contingency
Plan), and respond (Incident Response Plan), to these events as they occur.
These plans are not meant to be long term restoration efforts, but rather guidelines
to get essential services to the customer as quickly as possible.
After the vulnerability assessments are complete and documented, further
planning can take place to develop strategies and solutions to minimize the
vulnerabilities and risks identified should they be encountered. It is essential that
responsibility for each area of concern be assigned to qualified personnel. It is also
essential that the plan be tested and practiced under realistic conditions to reveal
any weaknesses that may not be initially apparent.
There is nearly an infinite number of natural or man-made disaster or other
emergency situations which could occur including bomb threats, earthquakes,
fires, flooding, gas leaks, hurricanes, tornados, snow storms, etc. However, while
there are any number of situations, which could occur, the associated
vulnerabilities and risks can generally be grouped as follows:
• The loss of the use of all or critical portions of the facility.
• Loss of the transmission facilities.
• Loss of access to facilities.
31As such, it does not matter why the loss of use or access to a facility occurs. For
example, access to the main facility might be lost due to a hazardous atmosphere,
a local law enforcement action or any number of other emergency situations.
What does matter is the availability of a flexible set of strategies and plans that are
well thought out in advance of the situation. They must be practiced and tested
periodically, used alone or in groups, to rapidly recover from the emergency.
Problems that [Cable system] could potentially encounter due to an emergency
situation include:
• Power failure at essential facilities such as a Dispatch, Headend, Hub
or NOC.
• Power failure in the physical plant.
• Damage to essential facilities or physical plant.
• Lock down - personnel cannot leave the facilities.
• Mandatory evacuations.
• Personnel cannot access the facilities or into the building(s).
• Loss of telephony wired/wireless.
• Loss of data networking capabilities.
• Loss of communications capabilities to field personnel.
• Satellite receive failures.
• Lawlessness.
Below are just two examples of the many guidelines and procedures you
will need for proper planning in the event of these types of problems. [Cable
system] is encouraged to define additional guidelines and procedures to
accommodate additional, as well as any locally unique, emergency situations
using similar forms in this section. Planning for different geographic locations is
also required. Planning for earthquakes in Southern California is a requirement,
but planning for snowstorms is not.

37Appendix A: Pandemic Preparedness
Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
OSHA have developed guidelines, including checklists, to assist businesses,
industries, and other employers in planning for a pandemic outbreak. This
document will reference their recommendations and provide links to the plans
developed by these organizations. Pandemic preparedness should be part of
every disaster recovery plan. Every disaster recovery plan every disaster recovery
From the OSHA documentation:
To reduce the impact of a pandemic on your operations, employees and the
general public, it is important for all businesses and organizations to include
continuity planning for a pandemic. Lack of continuity planning can result in a
cascade of failures as employers attempt to address challenges of a pandemic
with insufficient resources and employees who might not be adequately trained in
the jobs they will be asked to perform. Proper planning will allow employers to
better protect their employees and prepare for changing patterns of commerce and
potential disruptions in supplies or services.
Develop a disaster plan that includes pandemic preparedness, review it regularly
and conduct drills.
Be aware of and review federal, state and local health department
pandemic influenza plans. Incorporate appropriate actions from these plans
into workplace disaster plans.
Prepare and plan for operations with a reduced workforce.
Work with your suppliers to ensure that you can continue to operate and
provide services.
Develop a sick leave policy that does not penalize sick employees, thereby
encouraging employees to stay home so that they do not infect other
employees. Recognize that employees with ill family members may need to
stay home to care for them.
Identify possible exposure and health risks to your employees. Are your
employees expected to have a lot of contact with the general public?
Minimize exposure to fellow employees or the public. For example, will
more of your employees work from home? This may require enhancement
of technology and communications equipment.
Identify business-essential positions and people required to sustain
business-necessary functions and operations. Prepare to cross-train or
develop ways to function in the absence of these positions.
38It is recommended that employers train three or more employees to be able
to sustain business-necessary functions and operations, and communicate
the expectation for available employees to perform these functions if
needed during a pandemic.
Plan for downsizing services but also anticipate any scenario that may
require a surge in your services.
Recognize that, in the course of normal daily life, all employees will have
non-occupational risk factors at home and in community settings that should
be reduced to the extent possible. Some employees will also have
individual risk factors that should be considered by employers as they plan
how the organization will respond to a potential pandemic (e.g. immuno-
compromised individuals and pregnant women).
Stockpile items such as soap, tissue, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and
recommended personal protective equipment. When stockpiling items, be
aware of each product's shelf life and storage conditions. Make sure that
your disaster plan protects and supports your employees, customers and
the general public. Be aware of your employees' concerns about pay, leave,
safety and health. Informed employees who feel safe at work are less likely
to be absent.
Develop policies and practices that distance employees from each other,
customers and the general public. Consider practices to minimize face-to-
face contact between employees such as e-mail, websites and
teleconferences. Policies and practices that allow employees to work from
home or to stagger their work shifts may be important as absenteeism rises.
Work with your employees and their union(s) to address leave, pay,
transportation, travel, childcare, absence and other human resource issues.
Provide your employees and customers in your workplace with easy access
to infection control supplies, such as soap, hand sanitizers, personal
protective equipment (such as gloves or surgical masks), tissues, and office
cleaning supplies.
Provide training, education and informational material about business-
essential job functions and employee health and safety, including proper
hygiene practices and the use of any personal protective equipment to be
used in the workplace. Be sure that informational material is available in a
usable format for individuals with sensory disabilities and/or limited English
proficiency. Encourage employees to take care of their health by eating
right, getting plenty of rest and getting a seasonal flu vaccination.
39Work with your insurance companies, and state and local health agencies
to provide information to employees and customers about medical care in
the event of a pandemic.
Assist employees in managing additional stressors related to the pandemic. These
are likely to include distress related to personal or family illness, life disruption,
grief related to loss of family, friends or coworkers, loss of routine support systems,
and similar challenges. Assuring timely and accurate communication will also be
important throughout the duration of the pandemic in decreasing fear or worry.
Employers should provide opportunities for support, counseling, and mental health
assessment and referral should these be necessary. If present, Employee
Assistance Programs can offer training and provide resources and other guidance
on mental health and resiliency before and during a pandemic.

51Section I: Purpose and Objectives
Potential emergencies at [Cable system] such as fires, explosions,
hazardous material spills, chemical releases and all other emergency situations
may require personnel to evacuate a facility. An EEP and adequate occupant
familiarity with a facility minimize threats to life and property. This plan applies to
all emergencies where personnel may need to evacuate for personal safety.
This EEP is intended to communicate the policies and procedures for
personnel to follow in an emergency situation. This written plan should be made
available, upon request, to personnel and their designated representatives by the
Emergency Evacuation Coordinator for the facility.
Under this plan, personnel will be informed of:
The plan's purpose.
Preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies.
Emergency escape procedures and route assignments.
Procedures to be followed by personnel who remain to control critical
plant operations before they evacuate.
Procedures to account for all personnel after an emergency evacuation
has been completed.
Rescue and medical duties for those staff members who perform them.
The alarm system.
[Name/title] is the Emergency Evacuation Coordinator for this facility and
has overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of this plan.
[Name/title] is the Alternate Emergency Evacuation Coordinator.
The Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, in coordination with the Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager, will review and update the plan as necessary.
Copies of this plan will be maintained in/at: [location]
Section II: General Guidelines
The following guidelines apply to this EEP:
All personnel should be trained in safe evacuation procedures. Refresher
training is required whenever the employee's responsibilities or designated
actions under the plan change, and whenever the plan itself is changed.
52The training may include use of floor plans and workplace maps that clearly
show the emergency escape routes included in the EEP. Color-coding aids
personnel in determining their route assignments. Floor plans and maps
should be posted at all times in main areas (i.e. stairwells, lobbies, elevator
lobbies, exit corridors) of [Cable system] to provide guidance in an
emergency.
Stairwells are the primary means for evacuation. Elevators are to be used
only when authorized by a fire or police officer.
Personnel will not be permitted to re-enter the facility until advised by the
Fire Department.
This EEP will be coordinated with efforts in connected facilities. Mutually
beneficial agreements can be reached regarding designated meeting sites and
shelter in the event of inclement weather.
Section III: Responsibilities of Emergency Evacuation Coordinator and
Safety Monitors
The Emergency Evacuation Coordinator is responsible for:
Obtaining and posting floor plans and route evacuation maps.
Overseeing the development, communication, implementation and
maintenance of the overall EEP.
Ensuring the training of occupants, Safety Monitors, and critical
operations personnel, and notifying all personnel of changes to the
plan.
Maintaining up to date lists of occupants, critical operations
personnel, and any other personnel with assigned duties under this
plan.
In the event of an emergency, relaying applicable information to the
Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, building occupants and Safety
Monitors.
Establishing designated meeting sites for evacuees.
In coordination with the Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, assist
in posting the EEP in work areas, communicating plan to occupants,
and updating the plan annually
The Safety Monitors are responsible for:
Assisting in familiarizing personnel with emergency evacuation
procedures.
53Acting as liaison between management, the Disaster Recovery
Planning Manager, and the Incident Response Team, and their work
area.
Ensuring that occupants have vacated the premise in the event of an
evacuation and for checking assigned areas.
Knowing where their designated meeting site is and for
communicating this information to building occupants.
Having a list of personnel in their area of coverage to facilitate a
head count at their designated meeting site.
Ensuring that disabled persons and visitors are assisted in
evacuating the facility.
Evaluating and reporting problems to the Emergency Evacuation
Coordinator after an emergency event.
Section IV: Alerting Occupants in Case of Fire or Other Emergency
In case of a fire, personnel should activate the nearest fire alarm box
and/or contact the local fire department. Fire alarm box locations are
noted on the evacuation floor plans in Section X. The alarm will serve
as an alert to building occupants for the need to evacuate.
It may be necessary to activate additional fire alarm boxes or shout
the alarm if people are still in the facility and the alarm has stopped
sounding or if the alarm does not sound. This can be done while
exiting.
Persons discovering a fire, smoky condition, or explosion should pull
the fire alarm box. Any pertinent fire or rescue information should be
conveyed to the Fire Department. All emergency telephone numbers
are listed at the beginning of this EEP.
State your name, your location, and the nature of the call. Speak
slowly and clearly. Wait for the dispatcher to hang up first. On
occasion the dispatcher may need additional information or may
provide you with additional instructions.
Section V: Evacuation Procedures for Facility Occupants
When the fire alarm sounds, all personnel should ensure that nearby
personnel are aware of the emergency, quickly shutdown operating
equipment, close doors, and exit the facility using stairwells.
All occupants should proceed to their Designated Meeting Site and
await further instructions from their Safety Monitor, Emergency
Evacuation Coordinator, Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, or
Incident Response Team member.
54All personnel should know where primary and alternate exits are
located and be familiar with the various available evacuation routes.
Floor plans with escape routes, alternate escape routes, exit
locations and designated meeting sites are located in Section X and
are posted in the facility.
Occupants should NOT use elevators as an escape route in the
event of a fire.
Notes and precautions:
Small fires can be extinguished more effectively if you are trained to
use a fire extinguisher. However, an immediate readiness to
evacuate is essential.
All fires, even those that have been extinguished, should be reported
to the local fire department immediately.
Never enter a room that is smoke filled.
Never enter a room if the door is warm to touch.
R - Rescue: When you discover a fire, rescue people in immediate
danger if you can do so without endangering yourself. Exit via a safe
fire exit. Never use elevators. Close doors to rooms with fire.
A - Alarm: Sound the alarm by pulling a firebox and call 911 from a
safe distance to notify fire command center of precise location of fire.
C - Confine: Close all doors, windows and other openings.
E - Evacuate: Evacuate the facility.
Section VI: Disabled Occupants
If a disabled occupant is unable to exit the facility unassisted, the Safety
Monitor should notify the emergency response personnel of the individual’s
location. Transporting of disabled individuals up or down stairwells should be
avoided until emergency response personnel have arrived. Unless imminent life-
threatening conditions exist in the immediate area occupied by a non-ambulatory
or disabled person, relocation of the individual should be limited to a safe area on
the same floor, in close proximity to an evacuation stairwell.
Section VII: On-Air Operations
Critical operations, including equipment that should be shut off or set-up to
operate unattended, and persons designated to complete these actions are
identified in Table 1. Procedures for these transition activities should be
predetermined for life safety and loss control purposes, as well as ensuring
complete evacuations in a timely manner.

The shutdown procedure to be followed by those employees who have
been assigned to care for essential [Cable System] operations include: On-air;
News Studio Operations; News Gathering; Sales and Human Resources.
Individuals involved in these transition procedures should be notified by
management of this responsibility in advance. They should be identified in the
EEP, and appropriately trained for the particular situation. Of course alternate
personnel should be identified as well.
Section VIII: Accountability Procedures for Emergency Evacuation
Groups working together on or in the same area should meet outside and
away from the facility in the prearranged designated meeting site. A list of the
primary and alternate designated meeting sites is listed on the floor plans in
Section X.
A roster of personnel to ensure that everyone has evacuated has been
developed by the Emergency Evacuations Coordinator. The list will be updated
whenever there is a personnel change.
Safety Monitors are designated by the Emergency Coordinator and/or the
Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and will conduct head counts once
evacuation has been completed. There should be at least one Safety Monitor per
floor or per twenty occupants to provide adequate guidance and instruction at the
time of an emergency.
Personnel selected as Safety Monitors are to be trained in the complete
workplace layout and the various primary and alternate escape routes from the
workplace. All trained personnel are made aware of employees with disabilities
who may need extra assistance and of hazardous areas to be avoided during
emergencies. Before leaving, the Safety Monitors are to check rooms and other
56enclosed spaces in the workplace for other staff members who may be trapped or
otherwise unable to evacuate the area, and convey this information to emergency
personnel. A list of Safety Monitors and Alternate Safety Monitors for [Television
station] appears in Table 2.

Instruct personnel to remain in area until further notice.
Report status to Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, Disaster Recovery
Planning Manager or Management.
Instruct personnel to remain at designated meeting site until further notice.
Section IX: Training and Communications
Each occupant should know that evacuation is necessary and what his/her
role is in carrying out the plan. Personnel should also know what is expected of
them during an emergency to assure their safety.
A method of training occupants in the requirements of the EEP is to give all
personnel a thorough briefing and demonstration. Managers and supervisors
should present this plan to personnel in staff meetings. Annual practice drills are to
be implemented and documented by the Emergency Evacuation Coordinator
and/or Disaster Recovery Planning Manager.
57The Emergency Evacuation Coordinator and/or Disaster Recovery Planning
Manager should maintain training attendance records.

v iIntroduction
The core of this document is the result of the Media Security and Reliability
Council which was chartered by the FCC to prepare a comprehensive national strategy
for securing and sustaining broadcast facilities throughout the United States during
attacks, natural disasters and all other threats nationwide.
Changes in technology required that this document be updated for The Communications
Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council to assure optimal reliability,
robustness and security. As of this date the MSRC I and MSRC II documents can be
found at http://www.mediasecurity.org.
Disaster recovery planning is a practical approach to contingency and risk
management designed to reduce the consequence of an extended disruption
of essential services. The scope of this document is to provide guidelines to develop a
short term Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) and Incident Response Manual (IRM)
(Appendix A) for use as a tool by your organization for the timely resumption of
essential services in emergency situations. Long-term Disaster Recovery plans, and
business recovery issues, while important, are beyond the scope of this document. This
document is generic in nature, and is designed to serve as a template. [Satellite
Broadcaster] is encouraged to adapt its use to accommodate any unique requirements
which may exist.
As you formulate your disaster recovery plans you should ask yourself
what you would do in the event your facility and all of the day-to-day
operational resources you use were no longer available.

Figure 1: Basic Recovery Planning Steps
2The objective of this document is to provide guidelines and strategies that will allow
[Satellite Broadcaster] to effectively accomplish these steps by assessing the vulnerability
and impact to critical systems, and to recover operations and essential services in the
event of a disruption caused by a natural or man-made disaster or other emergency situations
in an organized and efficient manner. To meet these objectives the DRP should address the
following major topics:
• Vulnerability assessment and prevention.
• Plan distribution and maintenance.
• Staff roles and responsibilities.
• Essential equipment, materials and services.
• Internal and external communications.
• Recovery strategies and procedures.
• Periodic Plan testing.
In the event of an incident, it is essential to ensure that proper levels of notification and
communication regarding the event are disseminated to personnel, emergency services and other
stakeholders.
It should be recognized that any plan should be flexible enough to be
adapted to the particular emergency situation. The key to recovering from an
emergency situation, with minimum impact, is to have a DRP and to follow it.
Requirements
When developing the DRP guidelines, the following requirements should be met:
• All processes critical to the continuation of essential services should be
identified.
• The plan should be reviewed no less than annually
• The plan should be tested.
Critical personnel should be identified and receive the plan.
• Availability of emergency information to the deaf and hard of hearing.
3Many people have come to depend on the delivery of multiple streams of information
broadcast over the air, internet, or other means. Planning and recovery should take into
account how these services will be backed up, restored and coordinated.
Definition of Terms

5Document Distribution
This section describes the procedures for distributing the DRP.
Procedures
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for the distribution
of the DRP, as well as any additional emergency procedures as applicable. The DRP
document should be distributed to the Incident Response Team (see Table 6) and others
listed on the Master Distribution List (see Table 3). Copies should also be kept in the
following locations:
Master Hard Copy – The original printed version of the DRP that is used to generate
subsequent copies. A hard copy of the DRP should be located in the local Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager’s office.
Master Soft Copy – The original electronic version of the DRP that is used to generate
subsequent copies. An electronic copy of the DRP should be stored on a storage
device that is routinely backed up.
• Distribution Copy #2 – A copy of the DRP should be kept at each
facility if separate facilities are used.
• Distribution Copy #3 – A copy of the DRP should be kept at the
Customer Support and Network Operations Center (NOC).
• Distribution Copy #4 – A copy of the DRP should be kept at a secure off-
site location.
• Distribution Copy #5 – When applicable, a copy of the DRP
should reside at a Division or Corporate office.
• Distribution Copy #6 – Two copies of the DRP should reside at the
Incident Command Center (ICC) (see Table 5).
6The DRP contains proprietary company information and is not for general
distribution. Each individual possessing a copy is responsible for maintaining it
in a secure location, and in accordance with company policies for the protection of
proprietary information. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is
responsible for maintaining the DRP in an updated condition and distributing
the revised document whenever the DRP is updated.
DRP Maintenance
This section describes the procedures for maintaining the DRP. Maintenance
procedures consist of two general categories: scheduled and unscheduled. Scheduled
maintenance is time-driven, where unscheduled maintenance is event-driven.
Scheduled Maintenance
Scheduled maintenance consists of a scheduled annual review and updates as
well as an annual structured walkthrough and tactical exercises.
Scheduled maintenance occurs as the result of a scheduled review of the plans.
Reviews are predictable and are scheduled not less than annually. The purpose of the
review is to determine whether changes are required to strategies, tasks, notifications
and assembly procedures.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for
initiating Scheduled Maintenance activities. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager
should initiate reviews twice yearly. The Incident Response Team and their
alternates should review the strategies and procedures for changes that may be
required. The reviews should address events that have occurred within each team members’ area
of responsibility that may affect prevention, response and recovery capability.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for any required
updates to the DRP which results from the review.
7The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should import all changes to the master
hard copy, print hard copies of the plan, redistribute the copies as described above,
and ensure that all issued copies are updated to the same level as the master hard copy.
Ongoing consideration should be given to how the DRP will be maintained
and stored in a secure and reliable manner. The DRP should be available to
key personnel under all circumstances.
Unscheduled Maintenance
Certain maintenance requirements are unpredictable and cannot be scheduled. The majority of
these unscheduled plan changes occur as the result of major changes to hardware, software,
network configurations, personnel changes, etc. The following are examples of items that may
trigger the need for unscheduled maintenance:
• Significant modifications in the physical plant (i.e., changes in equipment,
Audio/Video(AV) processing chains, network operating software, changes
to Local Receive Facility (LRF) routing services, changes in IT based local
area or wide area networking connectivity, etc.).
• Changes in on-site and off-site storage facilities (i.e. Parts and equipment
storage lockers, sheds, closets….think about both physical and data storage).
• Changes in major operations facilities (i.e., On-Air Production Studio,
News Room, Broadcast Equipment Room, Customer Support Centers,
Network Engineering Facilities, Uplink Facilities, satellites and the
transponders in use).
• Significant modification of business or operational support systems
(i.e. traffic and billing systems, AV scheduling systems, automation systems
or anything that integrates with and affects day to day technical operations).
• Personnel transfers, terminations, promotions, relocation (i.e., home
telephone and/or cell telephone number changes) or resignations of
individuals from the Incident Response Team.
• Recent acquisition of or merger with another company.
Textual alert delivery that relies on IT specific resources or IP integration with
3rd party delivery mechanisms
8The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should be made aware of all potential changes to the
plans resulting from unscheduled maintenance. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should
meet with the personnel submitting the change and update the DRP as necessary.
DRP Testing
This section describes the procedures for periodically testing the DRP
Responsibility for Establishing Testing Scenarios
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and the Technology Manager (Title
will vary depending on the company such as Chief Engineer, Director of
Engineering, etc) should meet with all department heads named in the Master
Distribution list to develop testing for each department. For example, the Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager and the appropriate Technical, Operations
and Customer Support Managers should meet to identify all critical components
of the satellite broadcast chain and compose testing scenarios for each. At first, a
block diagram of all major subsystems can be developed, then as the plan
matures; smaller subsystems can be included in the testing scenarios.
Generally satellite uplink centers have superior failover and backup systems in
place due to the concentration of financial assets and the critical path of the facility
in the satellite broadcast chain. However, it is just as important to consider customer
service centers, data centers, and other business centers. It is not just the core
broadcast chain that is important in maintaining company operations in a
disaster. A test for loss of a major customer service facility may involve switching
to an alternate site, or may involve setting up temporary facilities to provide
customer service capabilities.
The input of all affected parties, such as customer support
technicians, installation technicians, as well as non-technical personnel should be
requested so that routine tasks essential to the normal operations of the
satellite broadcaster are not overlooked.
While conducting DRP testing, it is essential to carefully document events
as they occur during the test, noting any unexpected, unusual or abnormal system
operation. Be aware of the amount of time and stress factors involved in carrying out
DRP testing scenarios. It is recommended that a staff member be assigned the task
of keeping a log during the test.
9This will be of assistance during the review of the test to refine and improve performance
in subsequent testing.
Scope and Type of Plan Testing
Conducting periodic tests of the DRP is encouraged to ensure that plans
meet the recovery needs defined by the organization. These tests should be structured
so as to be realistic without disrupting the normal business process. Testing should be
planned, organized and conducted in such a way that results can be documented,
verified, and evaluated.
Disasters can happen in many ways, some unimaginable and unforeseeable.
Developing a testing scenario for each and every disaster may not be possible. The
Disaster Recovery Planning Manger should make every effort to identify all types
of disasters likely to occur in their locality and then imagine other disasters which
may occur, though only rarely. All disaster testing scenarios should be based on
worst case conditions.
During the testing of the DRP it may not be possible to duplicate the actual
conditions of a disaster. For example, while conducting a test of the DRP for a
complete evacuation of a facility such as a bomb threat, the actual physical evacuation
of personnel and customers may not be practical because of the business
disruption that will result from the test.
For some testing, a simulation can be used. For example, if the test for that
day is a complete building evacuation; non critical personnel can assemble at
their assigned meeting point, or, if the facility is in a high rise building, a
simulated assembly area might be the elevator lobby on the tested floor. The
testing team would then interview the staff to make certain they know what
procedures to follow in the event of an actual building evacuation.
Structured walkthrough.
A structured walkthrough is the first step in developing a testing strategy and
may consist of gathering department heads and touring the facility to identify critical
areas of concern. Each department head can identify the critical systems in their area
of responsibility while noting comments from others about inter-operability issues.
A priority list of testing of all major systems and subsystems can then be developed.
10Site specific exercise.
Some locations may require site specific exercises. The plans and testing for
the main facilities may not work for other locations. Testing and planning need to be
customized for all locations.
Schedule of Plan Testing
It is recommended that a schedule be developed for testing of each critical
system and subsystem. For example, the “loss of customer service center” test might
be scheduled during non-peak hours to avoid interruption of service.
Critical systems should be tested more often than ancillary subsystems. The Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager may require “loss of an uplink service” testing every
three months, while “loss of a satellite” simulation testing may be performed only
once or twice per year. The DRP in its entirety must be reviewed no less than annually.
Some testing, for example, emergency generator power systems, should be
done regularly and tested annually with all power fully disconnected from the
utility power grid. This will verify that all critical systems are connected to the
correct emergency backup power supply.
A local station that was testing its UPS and emergency power monthly,
fully expected to pass their annual test with all the power fully disconnected
from the utility power grid. All systems ran correctly as expected except
that the main newsroom had no lights. The newsroom was completely dark.
During a recent electrical renovation the newsroom lighting was
connected to the wrong power source. This situation would not have been
found without this type of test.
11Plan Testing Announcements
Announcements of major system and subsystem testing should be given far enough in advance
to allow for proper steps to be taken in preparation for the test. For example, if the
automation system is to be tested, engineering personnel should make sure that all data
systems are fully backed up and redundant. Steps should be taken in case the tested system
fails the scheduled test to make sure that there are no unplanned interruptions to the stations on
air program material (dead air). In the event of a main channel encoder system test, steps
must be taken in preparation for the backup channel encoder to be on standby in case
unforeseen events prevent the main channel encoder from returning to or remaining in service.
In general, a 7 to 10 day advance notice of DRP plan testing should be sufficient, but it is
important to examine all operations to insure adequate notice is given.
After the DRP is developed, consideration should be given to preparing an annual
schedule of systems and subsystems testing. This will assist engineering and operations
personnel in planning maintenance tasks and upgrades to either coincide with or
avoid DRP testing parameters.
12In the event of an actual disaster, it is critical that a complete event log
be kept to allow for a later review of recovery efforts and any changes that may
improve those procedures.
Test Scenarios
In this section, all critical systems and subsystems are identified and categorized
by order of priority for creating a DRP testing strategy. Each industry has its own
particular vulnerabilities. As vulnerabilities are identified, a corresponding testing
plan needs to be developed. Here are some examples:
• Disaster - Loss of uplink service or facility, Recovery – Backup uplink site.
• Disaster – Loss of Customer Service Center, Recovery – move operations
to a backup facility or a temporary facility.
• Disaster – Evacuation of building, Recovery – move operations to remote
location.
Disaster – Loss of critical system data – Recovery – initiate file recovery
procedures
When composing the test scenario, consideration should be given to the
complexity of the test, how much time it will take to perform the test, how much time
it will take to properly de-brief and evaluate the test, and the general impact of the
test on normal day to day operations of the facility. Also, if the test includes change
out of equipment and/or changes to normal signal path routing, care should taken to
restore the tested system to pre-test configuration.
It is recommended that careful system configuration notes and photos be taken before the test
is conducted to ensure that the system can be restored to normal operations.
13Evaluation of Plan Testing
As each segment of the DRP is tested, an evaluation should be conducted to
identify problem areas in both the testing scenario and the recovery strategy. The
following question will help to serve as a guide for evaluating the efficacy of the
conducted tests:
• Did the testing run smoothly?
• Did the test run through all the steps to conclusion?
• Is the test practical?
• Does the test show that the planned recovery strategy is
functional?
• Does the test interfere with other systems or departments not included in
the test?
• Does the test interfere with subscriber’s’ enjoyment of regularly scheduled
programming?
• At the conclusion of the test, was a return to normal operations easily
accomplished?
After completion of the test, a series of meetings should be held with the
affected departments, as well as the Incident Response Team and Emergency
Evacuation Team in order to compile observations, comments, and criticisms
and give each participant a chance to recommend if necessary, changes to the
plan. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should then update the plan
and redistribute the revised plan.
It may be necessary to re-test the same segment of the plan multiple
times before a testing protocol is agreed upon by all concerned departments. Proper
planning, testing and implementation of recovery strategies will facilitate a fast and
complete return to “normal” operations during an emergency.
Remember, it is much easier to solve problems in the light of day than in
the fog of war.
14Proper planning, testing and implementation of recovery strategies will facilitate a fast and
complete return to “normal” operations during an emergency. Subscribers will remember that it
was your system that stayed on the air and relayed important news and critical emergency
information during the crisis.
Plan Testing History
DRP testing should be carefully documented to provide a complete record of
events as the plan is maintained and updated. The plan testing history will then
provide an accurate record of test results, evaluations and updates as well as a record
of when each test segment of the plan was carried out. The Disaster Recovery
Planning Manager can use the test history as a tool to determine what changes may
have occurred if a test suddenly no longer works. A log for documenting the test
results is provided in Table 4.

Prevention
Vulnerability Assessment Guidelines
To facilitate the assessment of vulnerabilities which potentially may exist in [Satellite
Broadcaster], a model Satellite Broadcast Vulnerability Assessment Checklist developed by the
Media Security and Reliability Council is provided in Appendix B (Media Security and
Reliability Council, 2005). The Media Security and Reliability Council (MSRC) is a Federal
Advisory Committee, formed by the Federal Communications Commission, to study, develop
and report on communications and coordination designed to assure the optimal reliability,
robustness and security of the broadcast and multi-channel video programming distribution
industries in emergency situations.
15The checklist is not intended to be comprehensive, and [Satellite Broadcaster] is
encouraged to adapt its use to accommodate any unique requirements which may exist. The
Vulnerability Assessment Checklist should be reviewed and updated as necessary but no less
frequently than annually. The following guidelines are also provided as a tool to help facilitate
the assessment of vulnerabilities which potentially may exist. [Satellite Broadcaster] is
encouraged to review and follow these guidelines:
• Redundancies that are planned to provide adequate protection against
equipment failure and even natural disasters are not necessarily the
same as those needed to protect against a deliberate attack.
Specifically, protection against deliberate attack requires security
measures at facilities and a combination of both redundancy and geographic
diversity for critical equipment and facilities.
• While keeping all video and data services on the air is most desirable,
ensuring that the video services remain on the air to serve the community
is an absolute necessity. The focus of prevention considerations should be
on facilities that have a role in originating or delivering news and/or
emergency warnings and notices to the public.
• Some capability should exist to obtain news and information in an
emergency situation such as mobile communication links to backup
facilities for local and national broadcasts or an arrangement
to receive signals from alternate local television and radio stations near the
disaster area.
• Backup communications capabilities should exist for relaying breaking news
and information. The use of DBS receivers is encouraged to provide
news and information during regional widespread emergencies which
may affect other local and regional broadcasters.
16In March of 2000, a small brush fire caused the Four Corners
Generating Station to trip off line resulting in a power outage affecting
almost the entire state of New Mexico. While I was on my way to the main
studio to start the main generator (fueled by natural gas and connected to the
natural gas main for a virtually unlimited fuel supply in preparation for Y2K), I
tuned across the radio dial and was met with an eerie silence as every
broadcast station within receiver range was off the air. This included FM, AM
and Television stations originating in Albuquerque 130 miles distant! The KTAO
radio station transmitter is entirely solar powered and within 15 minutes
after the outage began, KTAO was back on the air at full power and for about
an hour was the only station in North Central New Mexico that was fully
operational. This power outage affected a very large area and was caused by a
relatively small brush fire under a power line.
• When completing the Vulnerability Assessment Checklist it is prudent to
consider the location and geographic distribution of key facilities, such as
studios, customer service sites, uplink sites and support engineering
locations.
• Appropriate measures should be taken to provide redundant,
geographically diverse methods and equipment for delivering program
material to the uplink centers.
• Collaboration with other satellite broadcasters should take place to increase
collective site and equipment diversity, redundancy and interconnections.
In times of emergency, “share the wealth” to ensure that all segments of the
community are well served.
• Appropriate measures should be taken to “harden” the uplink facility
sites, particularly in areas prone to severe weather or natural disasters.
• Appropriate measures should be taken to provide backup power capabilities
for all key facilities, including main studios, content origination sites,
uplink and customer support sites.
17• Essential equipment and service suppliers should be examined carefully to
ensure that critical resources will have sufficient capacity to meet needs
during an emergency.
• Physical security such as chain link fences augmented by security
personnel and/or video surveillance is recommended at all sites critical to
the broadcast operation.
• Satellite broadcasters should employ diverse power grid sources wherever
feasible.
• Satellite broadcasters should take appropriate measures to provide
backup power capabilities for their key facilities, including
studios/newsrooms, satellite communications and uplink centers.
• Satellite broadcasters with Local Receive Facilities (LRF) should ensure that
they have robust and redundant ways to communicate local
content to their uplink centers.
• Satellite broadcasters should have backup signal feeds to their primary
satellite transmit and receive sites.
Satellite systems should plan IT disaster recovery procedures for sourcing
replacement infrastructure (routers, switches, and firewalls), servers,
computers and software media needed to restore, operate the facility or
operation. Data services for communication such as email, Internet access
and critical data files should be coordinated with IT recovery procedures.
• Satellite broadcasters with original programming should plan to have
emergency origination capability at a separate location from their
primary studio (e.g., backup studio, remote van, another station, etc).
• Satellite broadcasters with local news origination should have a remote
vehicle, or some means of delivering live news and information from a
remote site.
• Satellite broadcasters should have a backup satellite transmitter and
receiver, or an alternate means (e.g., a Satellite Radio receiver, a
dedicated phone line or a streaming audio Internet connection) to send and
receive signals from and to national news services in emergency situations.
18• With the cooperation of federal and local policy makers, all broadcasters in
a market should collaborate to increase their collective site diversity and
redundancy, including news studios; operations; satellite transmit/receive
facilities and transmitter/ antenna sites.
• [Satellite Broadcaster] should coordinate with federal and local authorities
to ensure that technical and operations personnel can gain access to
essential facilities equipment during times of emergencies.

result in a disruption in [Satellite Broadcaster] operations and delivery of essential
services. An emergency event may not require that the entire DRP be implemented.
Each event should be evaluated on its impact and severity by the Incident Response
Team and Management.
Initial Assessment
These general guidelines should be followed by the individual(s) discovering
or responding to the emergency situation. If possible and time permits, the following
assessment process should occur:
• Assess the situation. Consider your safety as a top priority
• If applicable, inform co-workers and customers of the situation.
• If necessary, evacuate the facility. Protect vital records and perform
emergency response; i.e., contain fire, power down operations
equipment, etc.
• When applicable, place calls to obtain the appropriate
assistance from local authorities, i.e., 911, etc.
• Document who has been called and their response.
• Notify the applicable Incident Response Team member. Be prepared
to provide the following information when applicable, to the personnel that
are contacted:
• Nature of the emergency, and time of the occurrence.
• Extent of damage to facilities and/or plant.
• Current status of the emergency situation including what is being done to
confine or rectify problem.
22• Resources which may be needed from a Corporate, Division, or Regional
offices.
• Members of the Incident Response Team who have been contacted.
• The local authorities that have been contacted.
• The best method to contact you.
• The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and applicable members of
the Incident Response Team will convene to determine a solution and
strategy for recovery.
It is the responsibility of each employee to address emergency situations in
accordance with the DRP in the event he/she is aware of a situation that could
result in a disruption in operations and delivery essential services. An emergency
event may not require that the entire plan be implemented. Each event should be
evaluated on its impact and severity by the Incident Response Team, Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager or Management.
Incident Command Center
The ICC is a location or locations identified in the planning process for the
Incident Response Team to operate from in the event of an emergency. The ICC
could simply be an area within the organization’s facilities, such as a conference room
or a designated external location. The ICC will be at the location(s) identified in Table
5.
23Table 5: Incident command center location
Primary Address Contact
Locations
Secondary Locations Address Contact
Regardless of where it is located, the ICC should have a backup power
source, phones, radio and television receivers, and any other communication
systems as needed including computers for email and access to the internet. An
example Inventory Checklist for the ICC is provided in Appendix C:
As you develop plans for your facilities in the event of an emergency,
you should ask yourself what resources will be needed for next 18-24 hour
period?
Evacuation Procedures
This section is designed to assist [Satellite Broadcaster] personnel in the
creation of an emergency response process for the protection of life and physical
assets in the event of a fire, explosion, chemical spill or any emergency
requiring a facility evacuation. An Emergency Evacuation Plan (EEP) template for
customization by [Satellite Broadcaster] is provided in Appendix D.
Guidelines:
• A site Emergency Evacuation Team should be identified. The team should
consist of an Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, as well as Safety
Monitors as appropriate for each floor of the site with the appropriate
number of male and female Searchers for each of the floors in the site.
24The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and Incident Response Team should be identified as
members of this team. Alternates should be assigned as appropriate.
• The Emergency Evacuation Team should be cross functional with
representation from other departments such as Security, Engineering, On
Air, Distribution, Production, Corporate Communication, Legal, Network
Operations Center (NOC), information technology (IT), Human Resources,
Medical, Facilities, Sourcing and Finance as applicable.
• Floor plans with the evacuation routes and any relevant evacuation
information should be posted on each floor (at several locations on
the floor). This information should also be included in the EEP.
• Designate meeting sites at a location outside your site providing sufficient
distance to ensure the safety of personnel and visitors.
• Review your operations to determine which critical operating systems
may require continuing attention or shutdown during an evacuation or other
emergency situation. Develop a procedure to ensure that requisite actions
are taken during an emergency. Ensure that you have designated personnel to
address these issues, provided them with the procedure and trained them in
its use.
• Train the Emergency Evacuation Team on their responsibilities to
implement the plan and to assist in the safe and orderly emergency
evacuation of the facilities.
• Ensure that you have a procedure in place for communication and
evacuation/safe refuge of disabled persons.
• Develop personnel responsibilities lists. Ensure that affected personnel
are familiar with individual and group responsibilities.
• Determine methods and procedures for essential recovery personnel,
including the Incident Recovery Team, Disaster Recovery Planning
Manger, engineering, operations, and technical staff members
to communicate their location and status on a predetermined basis after
evacuation occurs.
25• Develop a training program for distribution and review by
personnel.
• Coordinate the EEP with the [Satellite Broadcaster] DRP and
IRM.
• Conduct periodic practice evacuations and evaluate the
outcome of those drills.
• Update the plan annually.
Key Contacts
Incident response team:
The Incident Response Team is a group of employees identified in advance
during the disaster planning process. They are recruited based on their skills and
knowledge of the various operations within the organizations. This team has
the responsibility to ascertain the level of response needed during and emergency, and
coordinate the recovery process. These individuals should also have alternates
identified in the event the primary member is not available to perform their duties. This
can be as simple as the General Manager and the department heads of the facility,
with assistant department heads as the alternates. Members of the Incident Response
Team are listed in Table 6.

30Communications
Effective communications can be a challenge during the extreme intensity of
a disaster or emergency situation. Whatever the circumstances, the goal of
communications during and after emergencies will be the rapid and accurate
collection and dissemination of information so that lives may be saved, injuries
minimized, fears allayed and essential services and operations recovered quickly and
effectively.
[Satellite Broadcaster] is encouraged to develop and implement a
communications strategy in advance that meets the needs of everyone affected
during a disaster or emergency situation. Consideration should be given to the
functions needed to perform in an emergency and the communications systems needed
to support them.
Internal:
During and after emergencies, it will be necessary to communicate with
[Satellite Broadcaster] personnel concerning what actions need to be taken and
other vital information. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and Incident
Response Team will be the central coordinative link for such communications. These
employees should be equipped with two- way radios, satellite phones, ham radios or
similar devices so that they may communication with each other effectively in real
time during an emergency.
During recovery efforts, essential recovery personnel, including the Incident
Recovery Team, Disaster Recovery Planning Manger and other engineering,
operations and technical staff members should communicate their location and status
on predetermined bases.
E-mail may also be an effective means of coordination among the Incident
Response Team before, during and after a disaster or other emergency situation.
[Satellite Broadcaster] should consider creating e- mail distribution lists so that
e-mail messages are broadcast to all members on the lists. Utilize an external
email service in the case where internal email is completely unavailable.” Consider
development of an offsite Disaster Portal where people can check in by entering an
update of their own location these messages could contain notifications about where to
meet, task responsibilities, resources that may be needed or other information
pertaining to the emergency.
If phones are operative, communications to personnel at home and at work will be handled
by attempting initially to contact personnel directly using the employee contact
information contained in Table 7. In this situation a voice mail system can also be used
to inform personnel of the status of the worksite. If this is unsuccessful or if the
phones are not operative, communications to personnel may be made using two-way
radios, satellite phones, ham radios, e-mail and messenger system, as deemed
appropriate, until such time as the normal phone service resumes. In some cases,
announcements can also be provided to the radio, television, and print media.
31Personnel should be informed in advance when ever this type of resource will be
utilized and directed to the one that will be used to provide information about
[Satellite Broadcaster].
Effective planning should take into account that emergency
personnel will need to know whether their families are safe and likewise, families
will want to know that the staff member is safe at the facility. However, personnel
should refrain from tying up telephone lines and thereby impeding necessary
communications. During an emergency involving [Satellite Broadcaster]
management, they may wish to establish a toll-free number, web site or other means
for family members to use to receive a status update.
External:
During an emergency situation, it is critical to communicate quickly, accurately
and perhaps frequently to a variety of external audiences, such as the media, local
authorities, municipalities, federal agencies (e.g., FEMA), elected officials,
opinion leaders, customers and suppliers.
During and after emergencies, these external entities may frequently contact
[Satellite Broadcaster]. These contacts may be general inquiries, requests
for sensitive information, requests for assistance, or they may be for the purpose of
exchanging information of mutual interest. To ensure that communication is ongoing
and shared with those entities touched by the emergency, it is essential that all
such contacts be immediately directed to the local Public Information Officer, Public
Affairs staff, Legal department, or other entity serving as the focal point for these
external communications. [Satellite Broadcaster] may also wish to consider
activating emergency information channels. The Federal Communications
Commission encourages broadcast licensees to transmit emergency alerts as a public
service.
To facilitate the gathering of information which may be needed by external
entities, a survey form template is provided in Appendix E. The template is not
intended to be comprehensive and [Satellite Broadcaster] is encouraged to adapt its
use to accommodate any unique situation which may exist.
32Recovery Strategies
All recovery plans should start with an assessment of the
vulnerabilities within [Satellite Broadcaster]. It is the responsibility of the Disaster
Recovery Planning Manger to work with [Satellite Broadcaster] personnel to identify
specific risks, threats, incidents or situations that may impact ongoing system
operations and to define the steps to be taken to prevent (Vulnerability Assessment),
react (Contingency Plan) and respond (Recovery Plan), to these events as they
occur. These plans are not meant to be long term restoration efforts, but rather
guidelines to get back on the air as quickly as possible.
After the vulnerability assessments are complete and documented, further
planning can take place to develop strategies and solutions to minimize the
vulnerabilities and risks identified, should they be encountered. It is essential that
responsibility for each area of concern be assigned to qualified personnel. It is also
essential that the plan be tested and practiced under realistic conditions to reveal any
weaknesses which may not be initially apparent.
There are nearly an infinite number of natural or man-made disasters or
other emergency situations which could occur including bomb threats, earthquake, fire,
flooding, gas leak, hurricanes, tornados, snow storms, etc. However, while there is
any number of situations which could occur, the associated vulnerabilities and risks can
generally be grouped as follows:
• The loss of the use of all or critical portions of the facility.
• Loss of the transmission facilities.
• Loss of access to facilities.
As such, it does not matter why the loss of use or access to a facility
occurs. For example, access to the main facility might be lost due to a hazardous
atmosphere, a local law enforcement action or any number of other emergency situations.
What does matter is the availability of a flexible set of strategies and plans that are
well thought out in advance of the situation. They must be practiced and tested
periodically, used alone or in groups, to rapidly recovery from the emergency.
33Problems that [Satellite Broadcaster] could potentially encounter due to an emergency situation
include:
• Station On-the-Air / Off-the-Air.
• Loss of the uplink building.
• Loss of master control systems.
• Lock down - personnel cannot leave the facilities.
• Mandatory evacuations.
• Personnel cannot access the facilities or into the building(s).
• Uplink facility issues.
• Loss of telephony wired/wireless.
• Loss of data networking capabilities.
• Loss of communications capabilities to field personnel.
• Newsroom computer system failures.
• Satellite distribution system failures.
• Lawlessness.
Below are just two examples of the many guidelines and
procedures you will need for proper planning in the event of these types of problems?
[Satellite Broadcaster] is encouraged to define additional guidelines and
procedures to accommodate additional, as well as any locally unique, emergency
situations using similar forms in this section. Planning for different geographic locations
is also required. Planning for earthquakes in Southern California is a requirement, but
planning for snow storms is not.

37Appendix A: Pandemic Preparedness
Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and OSHA have
developed guidelines, including checklists, to assist businesses, industries, and other employers
in planning for a pandemic outbreak. This document will reference their recommendations and
provide links to the plans developed by these organizations. Pandemic preparedness should be
part of every disaster recovery plan.
From the OSHA documentation:
To reduce the impact of a pandemic on your operations, employees and the general public, it is
important for all businesses and organizations to include continuity planning for a pandemic.
Lack of continuity planning can result in a cascade of failures as employers attempt to address
challenges of a pandemic with insufficient resources and employees who might not be
adequately trained in the jobs they will be asked to perform. Proper planning will allow
employers to better protect their employees and prepare for changing patterns of commerce and
potential disruptions in supplies or services.
Develop a disaster plan that includes pandemic preparedness, review it regularly and conduct
drills.
▪ Be aware of and review federal, state and local health department pandemic influenza
plans. Incorporate appropriate actions from these plans into workplace disaster plans
▪ Prepare and plan for operations with a reduced workforce.
▪ Work with your suppliers to ensure that you can continue to operate and provide services.
▪ Develop a sick leave policy that does not penalize sick employees, thereby encouraging
employees to stay home so that they do not infect other employees. Recognize that
employees with ill family members may need to stay home to care for them.
▪ Identify possible exposure and health risks to your employees. Are your employees
expected to have a lot of contact with the general public?
▪ Minimize exposure to fellow employees or the public. For example, will more of your
employees work from home? This may require enhancement of technology and
communications equipment.
▪ Identify business-essential positions and people required to sustain business-necessary
functions and operations. Prepare to cross-train or develop ways to function in the
absence of these positions. It is recommended that employers train three or more
employees to be able to sustain business-necessary functions and operations, and
communicate the expectation for available employees to perform these functions if
needed during a pandemic.
▪ Plan for downsizing services but also anticipate any scenario which may require a surge
in your services.
▪ Recognize that, in the course of normal daily life, all employees will have non-
occupational risk factors at home and in community settings that should be reduced to
the extent possible. Some employees will also have individual risk factors that should
be considered by employers as they plan how the organization will respond to a
potential pandemic (e.g., immuno-compromised individuals and pregnant women).
▪ Stockpile items such as soap, tissue, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and recommended
38personal protective equipment. When stockpiling items, be aware of each product's
shelf life and storage conditions. Make sure that your disaster plan protects and
supports your employees, customers and the general public. Be aware of your
employees' concerns about pay, leave, safety and health. Informed employees who feel
safe at work are less likely to be absent.
▪ Develop policies and practices that distance employees from each other, customers and
the general public. Consider practices to minimize face-to-face contact between
employees such as e-mail, websites and teleconferences. Policies and practices that
allow employees to work from home or to stagger their work shifts may be important
as absenteeism rises.
▪ Work with your employees and their union(s) to address leave, pay, transportation, travel,
childcare, absence and other human resource issues.
▪ Provide your employees and customers in your workplace with easy access to infection
control supplies, such as soap, hand sanitizers, personal protective equipment (such as
gloves or surgical masks), tissues, and office cleaning supplies.
▪ Provide training, education and informational material about business-essential job
functions and employee health and safety, including proper hygiene practices and the
use of any personal protective equipment to be used in the workplace. Be sure that
informational material is available in a usable format for individuals with sensory
disabilities and/or limited English proficiency. Encourage employees to take care of
their health by eating right, getting plenty of rest and getting a seasonal flu vaccination.
▪ Work with your insurance companies and state and local health agencies to provide
information to employees and customers about medical care in the event of a
pandemic.
Assist employees in managing additional stressors related to the pandemic. These are likely to
include distress related to personal or family illness, life disruption, grief related to loss of
family, friends or coworkers, loss of routine support systems, and similar challenges. Assuring
timely and accurate communication will also be important throughout the duration of the
pandemic in decreasing fear or worry. Employers should provide opportunities for support,
counseling, and mental health assessment and referral should these be necessary. If present,
Employee Assistance Programs can offer training and provide resources and other guidance on
mental health and resiliency before and during a pandemic.

50Section I: Purpose and Objectives
Potential emergencies at [Satellite Broadcaster] such as fire, explosion,
hazardous material spill, chemical releases and all other emergency situations
may require personnel to evacuate a facility. An EEP and adequate occupant
familiarity with a facility minimize threats to life and property. This plan applies to
all emergencies where personnel may need to evacuate for personal safety.
This EEP is intended to communicate the policies and procedures for
personnel to follow in an emergency situation. This written plan should be made
available, upon request, to personnel and their designated representatives by the
Emergency Evacuation Coordinator for the facility.
Under this plan, personnel will be informed of:
• The plan's purpose.
• Preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies.
• Emergency escapes procedures and route assignments.
• Procedures to be followed by personnel who remain to control critical
plant operations before they evacuate.
• Procedures to account for all personnel after an emergency evacuation have
been completed.
• Rescue and medical duties for those staff members who perform
them.
• The alarm system.
[Name/title] is the Emergency Evacuation Coordinator for this facility
and has overall responsibility for the preparation and
implementation of this plan.
[Name/title] is the Alternate Emergency Evacuation Coordinator. The
Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, in coordination with the
Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, will review and update the plan as
Necessary. Copies of this plan will be maintained in/at: [location]
51Section II: General Guidelines
The following guidelines apply to this EEP:
• All personnel should be trained in safe evacuation procedures.
Refresher training is required whenever the employee's
responsibilities or designated actions under the plan change, and
whenever the plan itself is changed.
• The training may include use of floor plans and workplace maps which
clearly show the emergency escape routes included in the EEP. Color-
coding aids personnel in determining their route assignments. Floor plans
and maps should be posted at all times in main areas (i.e., stairwells,
lobbies, elevator lobbies, exit corridors) of [Satellite Broadcaster] to
provide guidance in an emergency.
• Stairwells are the primary means for evacuation. Elevators are to be used
only when authorized by a fire or police officer.
• Personnel will not be permitted to re-enter the facility until advised by
the Fire Department.
This EEP will be coordinated with efforts in connected facilities. Mutually
beneficial agreements can be reached regarding Designated Meeting Sites and
shelter in the event of inclement weather.
Section III: Responsibilities of Emergency Evacuation Coordinator and Safety
Monitors
The Emergency Evacuation Coordinator is responsible for:
• Obtaining and posting floor plans and route evacuation maps.
• Overseeing the development, communication, implementation and
maintenance of the overall EEP.
• Ensuring the training of occupants, Safety Monitors, and critical operations
personnel, and notifying all personnel of changes to the plan.
• Maintaining up to date lists of building occupants, critical operations
personnel, and any other personnel with assigned duties under this plan.
52• In the event of a fire or other emergency, relaying applicable information
to the Disaster Recovery Planning Manager,
building occupants and Safety Monitors.
• Establishing Designated Meeting Sites for evacuees.
• In coordination with the Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, assist in
posting the EEP in work areas, communicating plan to building occupants,
and updating the plan annually.
The Safety Monitors are responsible for:
• Assisting in familiarizing personnel with emergency evacuation
procedures.
• Acting as liaison between management, the Disaster Recovery Planning
Manager, and the Incident Response Team, and their work area.
• Ensuring that building occupants have vacated the premise in the event of
an evacuation and for checking assigned areas.
• Knowing where their Designated Meeting Site is and for
communicating this information to building occupants.
• Having a list of personnel in their area of coverage to facilitate a head count
at their Designated Meeting Site.
• Ensuring that disabled persons and visitors are assisted in evacuating
the facility.
• Evaluating and reporting problems to the Emergency
Evacuation Coordinator after an emergency event.
Section IV: Alerting Occupants in Case of Fire or Other Emergency
• In case of a fire, personnel should activate the nearest fire alarm box and/or
contact the local fire department. Fire alarm box locations are noted on
the evacuation floor plans in Section XII. The alarm will serve as an alert
to building occupants for the need to evacuate.
53• It may be necessary to activate additional fire alarm boxes or shout the
alarm if people are still in the facility and the alarm has stopped sounding or
if the alarm does not sound. This can be done while exiting.
• Persons discovering a fire, smoky condition, or explosion should pull the
fire alarm box. Any pertinent fire or rescue information should be
conveyed to the Fire Department. All emergency telephone numbers are
listed at the beginning of this EEP.
• State your name, your location and the nature of the call. Speak slowly and
clearly. Wait for the dispatcher to hang up first. On occasion the
dispatcher may need additional information or may provide you with
additional instructions.
Section V: Evacuation Procedures for Facility Occupants
• When the fire alarm sounds, all personnel should ensure that nearby
personnel are aware of the emergency, quickly shutdown operating
equipment (e.g., compressed gas cylinders), close doors and exit the facility
using stairwells.
• All occupants should proceed to their Designated Meeting Site and await
further instructions from their Safety Monitor, Emergency Evacuation
Coordinator, Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, or Incident Response
Team member.
• All personnel should know where primary and alternate exits are located
and be familiar with the various available evacuation routes. Floor plans
with escape routes, alternate escape routes, exit locations and
Designated Meeting Sites are located in Section XII and are posted in
the facility.
• Occupants should NOT use elevators as an escape route in the event of a
fire.
Notes and Precautions:
• Small fires can be extinguished more effectively if you are trained to
use a fire extinguisher. However, an immediate readiness to evacuate
is essential.
54• All fires, even those that have been extinguished, should be reported to
the local fire department immediately.
• Never enter a room that is smoke filled.
• Never enter a room if the door is warm to touch.
• R - Rescue: When you discover a fire, rescue people in immediate
danger if you can do so without endangering yourself. Exit via a safe
fire exit. Never use elevators. Close doors to rooms with fire.
• A - Alarm: Sound the alarm by pulling a fire box and call 911 from a
safe distance to notify fire command center of precise location of fire.
• C - Confine: Close all doors, windows and other openings.
• E - Evacuate: Evacuate the facility.
Section VI: Disabled Occupants
If a disabled occupant is unable to exit the facility unassisted, the Safety
Monitor should notify the emergency response personnel of the individual’s
location. Transporting of disabled individuals up or down stairwells should be
avoided until emergency response personnel have arrived. Unless imminent life-
threatening conditions exist in the immediate area occupied by a non-ambulatory or
disabled person, relocation of the individual should be limited to a safe area on the
same floor, in close proximity to an evacuation stairwell.
Section VII: On-Air Operations
Critical operations, including equipment that should be shut off or set-up to
operate unattended, and persons designated to complete these actions are identified in
Table 1. Procedures for these transition activities should be predetermined for life
safety and loss control purposes, as well as ensuring complete evacuations in a timely
manner.

The shutdown procedure to be followed by those employees who have been
assigned to care for essential [Satellite Broadcaster] operations include:
On-air; Uplink Operations; News Gathering; Sales and Human Resources.
Individuals involved in these transition procedures should be
notified by management of this responsibility in advance. They should be identified in
the EEP, and appropriately trained for the particular situation. Of course alternate
personnel should to be identified as well.
Section VIII: Accountability Procedures for Emergency Evacuation
Groups working together on or in the same area should meet outside and
away from the facility in the prearranged Designated Meeting Site. A list of the
primary and alternate Designated Meeting Sites is listed on the floor plans in Section
X.
A roster of personnel to ensure that everyone has evacuated has been
developed by the Emergency Evacuations Coordinator. The list will be updated
whenever there is a personnel change.
Safety Monitors are designated by the Emergency Coordinator and/or the
Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and will conduct head counts once evacuation
has been completed. There should be at least one Safety Monitor per floor or per
twenty occupants to provide adequate guidance and instruction at the time of an
emergency.
56Personnel selected as Safety Monitors are to be trained in the complete workplace layout and the
various primary and alternate escape routes from the workplace. All trained personnel are
made aware of employees with disabilities who may need extra assistance and of
hazardous areas to be avoided during emergencies. Before leaving, the Safety Monitors are to
check rooms and other enclosed spaces in the workplace for other staff members who may
be trapped or otherwise unable to evacuate the area, and convey this information to emergency
personnel. A list of Safety Monitors and Alternate Safety Monitors for [Satellite Broadcaster]
appears in Table 2.

• Take head count of his or her group.
• Assume the role of department contact to answer questions.
• Instruct personnel to remain in area until further notice.
• Report status to Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager or Management.
57• Instruct personnel to remain at Designated Meeting Site until further
notice.
Section IX: Training and Communications
Each occupant should know that evacuation is necessary and what his/her role
is in carrying out the plan. Personnel should also know what is expected of them during
an emergency to assure their safety.
A method of training occupants in the requirements of the EEP is to give all
personnel a thorough briefing and demonstration. The department should have all
managers and supervisors present this plan to personnel in staff meetings. Annual
practice drills are to be implemented and documented by the Emergency
Evacuation Coordinator and/or Disaster Recovery Planning Manager.
Training attendance records should be maintained by the
Emergency Evacuation Coordinator and/or Disaster Recovery Planning Manager.
Section XII: Site Specific Information
In this Section, the Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, in
coordination with the Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, is to insert the following
site specific information:
• Facility Floor Plan.
• Primary and Secondary Emergency Evacuation Routes.
• Designated Meeting Sites.
• Exits.
• Fire Alarm Box Locations.

viIntroduction
The core of this document is the result of the Media Security and Reliability
Council, which was chartered by the FCC to prepare a comprehensive national
strategy for securing, and sustaining broadcast facilities throughout the United
States during attacks, natural disasters and all other threats nationwide.
Changes in technology required that this document be updated for The
Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council to assure optimal
reliability, robustness and security. As of this date the MSRC I and MSRC II
documents can be found at http://www.mediasecurity.org.
Disaster recovery planning is a practical approach to contingency and risk
management designed to reduce the consequence associated with an extended
disruption of essential services. The scope of this document is to provide
guidelines to develop a short term Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) and Incident
Response Manual (IRM) (Appendix A) for use as a tool by your organization for
the timely resumption of essential services in emergency situations. Long-term
Disaster Recovery plans, and business recovery issues, while important, are
beyond the scope of this document. This document is generic in nature, and is
designed to serve as a template. [Television station] is encouraged to adapt its
use to accommodate any unique requirements that may exist.
As you formulate your disaster recovery plans you should ask yourself what
you would do in the event your facility and all of the day-to-day operational
resources you use were no longer available.
1Objectives
Figure 1 shows the basic disaster recovery planning steps that should be followed
in order to ensure that the timely recovery of essential services is initiated in the
event of an emergency situation.

2The objective of this document is to provide guidelines and strategies that will
allow [Television station] to effectively accomplish these steps by assessing the
vulnerability and impact to critical systems, and to recover operations and
essential services in the event of a disruption caused by a natural or man-made
disaster or other emergency situations in an organized and efficient manner. To
meet these objectives the DRP should address the following major topics:
Vulnerability assessment and prevention.
Plan distribution and maintenance.
Staff roles and responsibilities.
Essential equipment, materials and services.
Internal and external communications.
Recovery strategies and procedures.
Periodic plan testing.
In the event of an incident, it is essential to ensure that proper levels of
notification and communication regarding the event are disseminated to personnel,
emergency services and other stakeholders.
It should be recognized that any plan should be flexible enough to be
adapted to the particular emergency situation. The key to recovering from an
emergency situation, with minimum impact, is to have a DRP and to follow it.
Requirements
When developing the DRP guidelines, the following requirements should be met:
All processes critical to the continuation of essential services should be
identified.
Critical personnel should be identified and receive the plan.
The plan should be reviewed no less than annually.
The plan should be tested.
Availability of emergency information to the deaf and hard of hearing.
Availability of emergency information to non-English speaking
persons.

5Document Distribution
This section describes the procedures for distributing the DRP.
Procedures
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for the distribution
of the DRP, as well as any additional emergency procedures as applicable. The
DRP document should be distributed to the Incident Response Team (see Table 6)
and others listed on the Master Distribution List (see Table 3). Copies should also
be kept in the following locations:
Master Hard Copy –– The original printed version of the DRP that is used to
generate subsequent copies. A hard copy of the DRP should be located in the
local Disaster Recovery Planning Manager’s office.
Master Soft Copy –– The original electronic version of the DRP that is used to
generate subsequent copies. An electronic copy of the DRP should be stored on a
storage device that is routinely backed up.
Distribution Copy #2 –– A copy of the DRP should be kept at each
facility if separate facilities are used.
Distribution Copy #3 –– A copy of the DRP should be kept at the
Customer Support and Network Operations Center (NOC).
Distribution Copy #4 –– A copy of the DRP should be kept at a
secure off-site location.
Distribution Copy #5 –– When applicable, a copy of the DRP should
reside at a Division or Corporate office.
Distribution Copy #6 –– Two copies of the DRP should reside at the
Incident Command Center (ICC) (see Table 5).
6The DRP contains proprietary company information and is not for general
distribution. Each individual possessing a copy is responsible for
maintaining it in a secure location, and in accordance with company policies
for the protection of proprietary information. The Disaster Recovery
Planning Manager is responsible for maintaining the DRP in an updated
condition and distributing the revised document whenever the DRP is
updated.
DRP Maintenance
This section describes the procedures for maintaining the DRP.
Maintenance procedures consist of two general categories: scheduled and
unscheduled. Scheduled maintenance is time-driven, where unscheduled
maintenance is event-driven.
Scheduled Maintenance
Scheduled maintenance consists of a scheduled annual review and updates
as well as an annual structured walkthrough and tactical exercises.
Scheduled maintenance occurs as the result of a scheduled review of the
plans. Reviews are predictable and are scheduled not less than annually. The
purpose of the review is to determine whether changes are required to strategies,
tasks, notifications and assembly procedures.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for initiating
Scheduled Maintenance activities. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager
should initiate reviews twice yearly. The Incident Response Team and their
alternates should review the strategies and procedures for changes that may be
required. The reviews should address events that have occurred within each team
member’s area of responsibility that may affect prevention, response and recovery
capability.
7The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager is responsible for any required
updates to the DRP that results from the review. The Disaster Recovery Planning
Manager should import all changes to the master hard copy, print hard copies of
the plan, redistribute the copies as described above, and ensure that all issued
copies are updated to the same level as the master hard copy.
Ongoing consideration should be given to how the DRP will be maintained
and stored in a secure and reliable manner. The DRP should be available to
key personnel under all circumstances.
Unscheduled Maintenance
Certain maintenance requirements are unpredictable and cannot be scheduled.
The majority of these unscheduled plan changes occur as the result of major
changes to hardware, software, network configurations, personnel changes, etc.
The following are examples of items that may trigger the need for unscheduled
maintenance:
Significant modifications in the physical plant (i.e. changes in
equipment, audio/video processing chain, network operating
software, changes to signal wire routing changes in IT based local
area or wide area networking connectivity, etc.).
Changes in on-site and off-site storage facilities (i.e. parts and
equipment, storage lockers, sheds, closets…think about both
physical and data storage).
Changes in major operations facilities (i.e. Master Control,
Production Studio, News Room, Rack Room, STL origination,
Transmitter Site).
Significant modification of business or operational support systems
(i.e. traffic and billing systems, scheduling systems, automation
systems, broadband distribution systems and IP phone systems or
anything that integrates with and affects day to day technical
operations).
Personnel transfers, terminations, promotions, relocation (i.e. home
telephone and/or cell telephone number changes) or resignations of
individuals from the Incident Response Team.
Recent acquisition of or merger with another company.
Textual alert delivery that relies on IT specific resources or IP
integration with 3rd party delivery mechanisms.
8The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should be made aware of all
potential changes to the plans resulting from unscheduled maintenance. The
Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should meet with the personnel submitting
the change and update the DRP as necessary.
DRP Testing
This section describes the procedures for periodically testing the DRP.
Responsibility for Establishing Testing Scenarios
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and the station Technology
Manager (Title will vary depending on the company such as Chief Engineer,
Director of Engineering) should meet with all department heads named in the
Master Distribution list to develop testing for each department. For example, the
Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and the Chief Engineer should meet to
identify all critical components of the air chain and compose testing scenarios for
each. At first, a block diagram of all major subsystems can be developed, then as
the plan matures; smaller subsystems can be included in the testing scenarios. A
test for loss of Master Control may involve switching to the newsroom or
production studio, or may involve setting up the station’s remote vehicle to provide
on air material.
The input of all affected parties, such as production managers, News
department managers, traffic managers, digital content managers and others
including non-technical personnel should be requested so that routine tasks
essential to the normal operations of the station are not overlooked.
While conducting DRP testing, it is essential to carefully document events
as they occur during the test, noting any unexpected, unusual or abnormal system
operation. Be aware of the amount of time and stress factors involved in carrying
out DRP testing scenarios. It is recommended that an engineering staff member or
assistant be assigned the task of keeping a log during the test. This will be of
assistance during the review of the test to refine and improve performance in
subsequent testing.
9Scope and Type of Plan Testing
Conducting periodic tests of the DRP is encouraged to ensure that plans
meet the recovery needs defined by the organization. These tests should be
structured so as to be realistic without disrupting the normal business process.
Testing should be planned, organized and conducted in such a way that results
can be documented, verified, and evaluated.
Disasters can happen in many ways, some unimaginable and
unforeseeable. Developing a testing scenario for each and every disaster may not
be possible. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should make every effort to
identify all types of disasters likely to occur in their locality and then imagine other
disasters that may occur, though only rarely. All disaster testing scenarios should
be based on worst-case conditions.
During the testing of the DRP it may not be possible to duplicate the actual
conditions of a disaster. For example, while conducting a test of the DRP for a
complete evacuation of a facility such as a bomb threat, the actual physical
evacuation of personnel and customers may not be practical because of the
business disruption that will result from the test.
For some testing, a simulation can be used. For example, if the test for that
day is a complete building evacuation; non-critical personnel can assemble
at their assigned meeting point, or, if the facility is in a high-rise building, a
simulated assembly area might be the elevator lobby on the tested floor. The
testing team would then interview the staff to make certain they know what
procedures to follow in the event of an actual building evacuation.
Structured Walkthrough
A structured walkthrough is the first step in developing a testing strategy and may
consist of gathering department heads and touring the facility to identify critical
areas of concern. Each department head can identify the critical systems in their
area of responsibility while noting comments from others about inter-operability
issues. A priority list of testing of all major systems and subsystems can then be
developed.
10Site-Specific Exercise
Some locations may require site-specific exercises. The plans and testing
for the main facilities may not work for other locations. Testing and planning needs
to be customized for all locations.
Schedule of Plan Testing
It is recommended that a schedule be developed for testing of each critical
system and subsystem. For example, the “loss of transmitter” test might be
scheduled during the night to avoid drive time interruption of service. Critical
systems should be tested more often than ancillary subsystems. The Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager may require “loss of transmitter” testing every three
months, while “loss of Master Control” testing may be performed only once or
twice per year and ““loss of audio processing”” less often. The DRP in its entirety
should be reviewed no less than annually.
Some testing, for example, emergency generator power systems, should be
done regularly and tested annually with all power fully disconnected from the utility
power grid. This will verify that all critical systems are connected to the correct
emergency backup power supply.
A local station that was testing its UPS and emergency power monthly, fully
expected to pass their annual test with all the power fully disconnected from
the utility power grid. All systems ran correctly as expected except that the
main newsroom had no lights. The newsroom was completely dark. During
a recent electrical renovation the newsroom lighting was connected to the
wrong power source. This situation would not have been found without this
type of test.
Plan Testing Announcements
Announcements of major system and subsystem testing should be given
far enough in advance to allow for proper steps to be taken in preparation for the
test. For example, if the automation system is to be tested, engineering personnel
should make sure that all data systems are fully backed up and redundant. Steps
should be taken in case the tested system fails the scheduled test to make sure
that there are no unplanned interruptions to the station’s on air program material
(dead air).
11In the event of a main transmitter systems test, steps must be taken in
preparation for the backup transmitter to be on standby in case unforeseen events
prevent the main transmitter from returning to or remaining on the air. In a typical
television station-engineering environment, a 7 to 10 day advance notice of DRP
plan testing should be sufficient.
After the DRP is developed, consideration should be given to preparing an
annual schedule of systems and subsystems testing. This will assist engineering
personnel in planning maintenance tasks and upgrades to either coincide with or
avoid DRP testing parameters.
In the event of an actual disaster, it is critical that a complete event log be
kept to allow for a later review of recovery efforts and any changes that may
improve those procedures.
Test Scenarios
In this section, all critical systems and subsystems are identified and categorized
by order of priority for creating a DRP testing strategy. Each television station may
have its own particular vulnerabilities. As vulnerabilities are identified, a
corresponding testing plan needs to be developed. Here are some examples:
Disaster - Loss of transmitter site/tower, Recovery – Backup transmitter
site.
Disaster - Loss of Master Control, Recovery – move operations to
newsroom or production studio.
Disaster - Evacuation of building, Recovery – move operations to remote
studio vehicle or location.
Disaster – Loss of critical system data – Recovery – initiate file recovery
procedures
When composing the test scenario, consideration should be given to the
complexity of the test, how much time it will take to perform the test, how much
time it will take to properly de-brief and evaluate the test, and the general impact of
the test on normal day to day operations of the facility. Also, if the test includes
change out of equipment and/or changes to normal signal path routing, care
should be taken to restore the tested system to pre-test configuration. It is
recommended that careful system configuration notes and photos be taken before
the test is conducted to ensure that the system can be restored to normal
operations.
12Evaluation of Plan Testing
As each segment of the DRP is tested, an evaluation should be conducted
to identify problem areas in both the testing scenario and the recovery strategy.
The following questions will help to serve as a guide for evaluating the efficacy of
the conducted tests:
Did the testing run smoothly?
Did the test run through all the steps to conclusion?
Is the test practical?
Does the test show that the planned recovery strategy is functional?
Does the test interfere with other systems or departments not
included in the test?
Does the test interfere with the viewer’s enjoyment of regularly
scheduled programming?
At the conclusion of the test, was a return to normal operations easily
accomplished?
After completion of the test, a series of meetings should be held with the
affected departments, as well as the Incident Response Team and Emergency
Evacuation Team in order to compile observations, comments, and criticisms and
give each participant a chance to recommend, if necessary, changes to the plan.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager should then update the plan and
redistribute the revised plan.
It may be necessary to re-test the same segment of the plan multiple times
before all concerned departments agree upon a testing protocol. Proper planning,
testing and implementation of recovery strategies will facilitate a fast and complete
return to “normal” operations during an emergency. Viewers will remember that it
was your station that stayed on the air and relayed important news and critical
emergency information during the crisis.
Remember, it is much easier to solve problems in the light of day than in the
fog of war.
13Plan Testing History
DRP testing should be carefully documented to provide a complete record
of events as the plan is maintained and updated. The plan testing history will then
provide an accurate record of test results, evaluations and updates as well as a
record of when each test segment of the plan was carried out. The Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager can use the test history as a tool to determine what
changes may have occurred if a test suddenly no longer works. A log for
documenting the test results is provided in Table 4.
Table 4: DRP Test History

Prevention
Vulnerability Assessment Guidelines
To facilitate the assessment of vulnerabilities, which potentially may exist at
[Television station], a model Television Station Vulnerability Assessment
Checklist developed by the Media Security and Reliability Council is provided in
Appendix B (Media Security and Reliability Council, 2005). The Media Security
and Reliability Council (“MSRC”) is a Federal Advisory Committee, formed by the
Federal Communications Commission, to study, develop and report on
communications and coordination designed to assure the optimal reliability,
robustness and security of the broadcast and multi-channel video programming
distribution industries in emergency situations.
The checklist is not intended to be comprehensive, and [Television
station] is encouraged to adapt its use to accommodate any unique requirements
that may exist.
14The Vulnerability Assessment Checklist should be reviewed and updated as
necessary but no less frequently than annually. The following guidelines are also
provided as a tool to help facilitate the assessment of vulnerabilities that potentially
may exist. [Television station] is encouraged to review and follow these
guidelines:
Redundancies that are planned to provide adequate protection
against equipment failure and even natural disasters are not
necessarily the same as those needed to protect against a deliberate
attack. Specifically, protection against deliberate attack requires
security measures at facilities and a combination of both redundancy
and geographic diversity for critical equipment and facilities.
The focus of prevention considerations should be on facilities that
have a role in originating or delivering news and/or emergency
warnings and notices to the public.
Disaster recovery plans should be periodically updated, tested and
rehearsed.
Some capability should exist to obtain news and information in an
emergency situation such as an alternate studio, remote studio or an
arrangement to receive signals from other local television and/or
cable broadcasters (e.g. ENG/SNG trucks or satellite links).
Backup radio and television receiver capabilities should exist for
relaying breaking news and information. The use of DBS receivers
is encouraged to provide news and information during regional
widespread emergencies that may affect other local and regional
broadcasters.
15In March of 2000, a small brush fire caused the Four Corners Generating
Station to trip off line resulting in a power outage affecting almost the entire
state of New Mexico. While I was on my way to the main studio to start the
main generator (fueled by natural gas and connected to the natural gas main
for a virtually unlimited fuel supply in preparation for Y2K), I tuned across
the radio dial and was met with an eerie silence as every broadcast station
within receiver range was off the air. This included FM, AM and Television
stations originating in Albuquerque 130 miles distant! The KTAO radio
station transmitter is entirely solar powered and within 15 minutes after the
outage began, KTAO was back on the air at full power and for about an hour
was the only station in North Central New Mexico that was fully operational.
This power outage affected a very large area and was caused by a relatively
small brush fire under a power line.
When completing the Vulnerability Assessment Checklist it is prudent
to consider the location and geographic distribution of key facilities in
the market, such as studios, STL origination sites, transmitter sites
and translator locations.
Stations should plan IT disaster recovery procedures for sourcing
replacement infrastructure (routers, switches, and firewalls), servers,
computers and software media needed to restore, operate the facility
or operation. Data services for communication such as email,
Internet access and critical data files should be coordinated with IT
recovery procedures.
Appropriate measures should be taken to provide redundant,
geographically diverse methods and equipment for delivering
program material to the STL, Internet-based connectivity,
transmitter, back-up transmitter and translator sites.
Collaboration with other local broadcasters should take place to
increase collective site and equipment diversity, redundancy and
interconnections. In times of emergency, “share the wealth” to
ensure that all segments of the community are well served.
Appropriate measures should be taken to “harden” the broadcast
facilities, studios and transmitter sites, particularly in areas prone to
severe weather or natural disasters.
Appropriate measures should be taken to provide backup power
capabilities for all key facilities, including main studios; STL
origination sites transmitter and translator sites.
16Considering the importance of the broadband systems in use
appropriate measures should be taken to provide alternate ways to
access your services in the event of an emergency situation.
Essential equipment and service suppliers should be examined to
ensure that critical resources would have sufficient capacity and
delivery capabilities to meet needs during an emergency. This is
particularly important where fuel for backup generators is concerned.
[Television station] should consider securing arrangements for fuel
deliveries from suppliers located outside of the local market during
emergency situations.
Physical security such as chain link fences augmented by security
personnel and/or video surveillance is recommended at all sites
critical to the broadcast operation.
Television broadcasters should have appropriate physical security,
augmented by security personnel and/or video surveillance at their
key facilities, including studios/newsrooms, satellite transmit and
receive sites and antenna/transmitter sites.
Television broadcasters should employ diverse power grid sources
wherever feasible.
Television broadcasters should take appropriate measures to provide
backup power capabilities for their key facilities, including
studios/newsrooms, satellite communications, and transmitters.
Television broadcasters with local news origination should ensure
that they have robust and redundant ways to communicate with
external news services and remote news teams, such as the use of
mobile radio and Internet to augment cell phones.
Television broadcasters should have backup signal feeds to their
primary satellite transmit and receive sites.
Television broadcasters should have back up signal feeds to support
any broadband distribution requirements.
Television broadcasters should have redundant signal paths to their
primary and backup transmission facilities.
Television broadcasters with local news origination should plan to
have emergency origination capability at a separate location from
their primary studio (e.g., backup studio, transmitter site, ENG truck,
another station, etc).
Television broadcasters should have the capability of receiving a
remote feed at an additional site from their primary studio (e.g.
directly at their tower site, at a backup studio, etc).
17Television broadcasters should have a backup satellite transmitter
and receiver, or an alternate means (e.g. a Satellite receiver, a
dedicated phone line or a streaming audio Internet connection) to
send and receive signals from and to national news services in
emergency situations.
Television broadcasters should have a backup transmitter, and
should attempt to make practical arrangements for geographic
diversity where possible (e.g. provisions for emergency use of other
backup transmitter/antenna facilities in the community or other
means).
Should make arrangements for Internet distribution in the event of
transmitter failure.
With the cooperation of federal and local policy makers, all Television
broadcasters in a market should collaborate to increase their
collective site diversity and redundancy, including news studios;
operations; satellite transmit/receive facilities’ broadband systems
and transmitter/antenna sites.
Television broadcasters should coordinate with federal, state and
local authorities to ensure that technical and operations personnel
are properly credentialed and recognized so they can carry out
recovery procedures and gain access to essential facilities and
equipment during times of emergencies.
Television broadcasters should coordinate with power and
communications entities to ensure that essential facilities and
equipment are given an adequate priority level with respect to repair
and recovery schedules.

20Personnel Authorized to Declare an Emergency
It is the responsibility of each employee to address emergency situations in
accordance with the DRP in the event that they are aware of a situation that
could result in a disruption in [Television station] operations and delivery of
essential services. An emergency event may not require that the entire DRP be
implemented. The Incident Response Team and Management should evaluate
each event on its impact and severity.
Initial Assessment
The individual(s) discovering or responding to the emergency
situation should follow these general guidelines. If possible and time
permits, the following assessment process should occur:
Assess the situation. Consider your safety as a top priority.
If applicable, inform co-workers and customers of the situation.
If necessary, evacuate the facility. Protect vital records and perform
emergency response; i.e. contain fire, power down operations
equipment, etc.
When applicable, place calls to obtain the appropriate assistance
from local authorities, i.e. 911, etc.
Document who has been called and their response.
Notify the applicable Incident Response Team member. Be
prepared to provide the following information when applicable, to the
personnel that are contacted:
Nature of the emergency, and time of the occurrence.
Extent of damage to facilities.
Current status of the emergency situation including what is being
done to confine or rectify problem.
21Resources that may be needed from Corporate, Division, or
Regional offices.
Members of the Incident Response Team who have been contacted.
The local authorities that have been contacted.
The best method to contact you.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and applicable members
of the Incident Response Team will convene to determine a solution
and strategy for recovery.
It is the responsibility of each employee to address emergency situations in
accordance with the DRP in the event he/she is aware of a situation that could
result in a disruption in operations and the delivery of essential services. An
emergency event may not require that the entire plan be implemented. The
Incident Response Team, Disaster Recovery Planning Manager or Management
should evaluate each event on its impact and severity.
Incident Command Center (ICC)
The ICC is a location or locations identified in the planning process for the
Incident Response Team to operate from in the event of an emergency. The ICC
could simply be an area within the organization’s facilities, such as a conference
room or a designated external location. The ICC will be at the location(s) identified
in Table 5.
Table 5: Incident Command Center Location
Primary Address Contact
L ocations
Secondary Locations Address Contact
22Regardless of where it is located, the ICC should have a backup power
source, phones, radio and television receivers, and any other communication
systems as needed including computers for email and access to the Internet.
Personnel should be assigned the responsibility of ensuring that the ICC contains
adequate supplies for a 48-72 hour period, and that those supplies are periodically
rotated and maintained. [Television station] may also wish to consider acquiring
security services for the ICC to protect essential equipment and assets. An
example Inventory Checklist for the ICC is provided in Appendix C:
As you develop plans for your facilities in the event of an emergency, you
should ask yourself what resources would be needed for the next 48-72
hours?
Evacuation Procedures
This section is designed to assist [Television station] personnel in the
creation of an emergency response process for the protection of life and physical
assets in the event of a fire, explosion, chemical spill or any emergency requiring a
facility evacuation. An Emergency Evacuation Plan (EEP) template for
customization by [Television station] is provided in Appendix D.
During the Hurricane Katrina recovery at WQRZ-LP in Bay St. Louis, MS
during September 2005, a situation occurred while Hurricane Rita was
affecting the already devastated area. WQRZ-LP was co-located with the
Hancock County Emergency Operations Center. While WQRZ-LP was
receiving a Tornado Warning on the EAS, a fire alarm was activated in the
building because of a faulty air handler motor. Fire Safety personnel were
attempting to evacuate essential radio station personnel while the
announcer was broadcasting a Tornado Warning that included the Hancock
County EOC in the path of the tornado. This is an example of conflict of
authority and responsibility and situations such as this should be addressed
in the planning phase of the Evacuation Process.
23Guidelines:
A site Emergency Evacuation Team should be identified. The team should
consist of an Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, as well as Safety
Monitors as appropriate for each floor of the site with the appropriate
number of male and female searchers for each of the floors in the site.
The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and Incident Response Team
should be identified as members of this team. Alternates should be
assigned as appropriate.
The Emergency Evacuation Team should be cross functional with
representation from other departments such as Security, EHS, On Air,
Distribution, Production, Corporate Communication, Legal, Human
Resources, Medical, Facilities, Sourcing and Finance as applicable.
Floor plans with the evacuation routes and any relevant evacuation
information should be posted on each floor (at several locations on the
floor). This information should also be included in the EEP.
Designate meeting sites at a location outside your site providing sufficient
distance to ensure the safety of personnel and visitors.
Review your operations to determine which critical operating systems may
require continuing attention or shutdown during an evacuation or other
emergency situation. Develop a procedure to ensure that requisite actions
are taken during an emergency.
Ensure that you have designated personnel to address these issues,
provide them with the procedure and train them in its use.
Train the Emergency Evacuation Team on their responsibilities to
implement the plan and to assist in the safe and orderly emergency
evacuation of the facilities.
Ensure that you have a procedure in place for communication and
evacuation/safe refuge of disabled persons.
Develop personnel responsibilities lists. Ensure that affected personnel are
familiar with individual and group responsibilities.
Determine methods and procedures for essential recovery personnel,
including the Incident Recovery Team, Disaster Recovery Planning
Manager, engineering, operations, and technical staff members to
communicate their location and status on a predetermined basis after
evacuation occurs.
Develop a training program for distribution and review by personnel.
Coordinate the EEP with the [Television station] DRP and IRM.
Conduct periodic practice evacuations and evaluate the outcome of those
drills.
Update the plan annually.
2 4Key Contacts
Incident Response Team:
The Incident Response Team is a group of employees identified in advance
during the disaster planning process. They are recruited based on their skills and
knowledge of the various operations within the organizations. This team has the
responsibility to ascertain the level of response needed during an emergency, and
coordinate the recovery process. These individuals should also have alternates
identified in the event the primary member is not available to perform their duties.
This can be as simple as the General Manager and the department heads
of the facility, with assistant department heads as the alternates. All members of
the Incident Response Team should carry a photo ID or other recognized
credentials in order to carry out recovery procedures and gain access to essential
facilities and equipment during times of emergencies. Members of the Incident
Response Team are listed in Table 6.

29Communications
Effective communications can be a challenge during the extreme intensity
of a disaster or emergency situation. Whatever the circumstances, the goal of
communications during and after emergencies will be the rapid and accurate
collection and dissemination of information so that lives may be saved, injuries
minimized, fears allayed, and essential services and operations recovered quickly
and effectively.
[Television station] is encouraged to develop and implement a
communications strategy in advance that meets the needs of everyone affected
during a disaster or emergency situation.
Consideration should be given to the functions needed to perform in an
emergency and the communications systems needed to support them.
Internal:
During and after emergencies, it will be necessary to communicate with
[Television station] personnel concerning what actions need to be taken and
other vital information. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and Incident
Response Team will be the central coordinative link for such communications.
These employees and other personnel involved in recovery procedures should be
equipped with cell phones, two-way radios, satellite phones, ham radios, text
messaging capabilities (e.g. “Blackberries”), or similar devices so that they may
communicate with each other effectively in real time during an emergency. It is
critical that [Television station] has multiple means of communicating reliably
with personnel during an emergency and not depend upon any single method.
During recovery efforts, essential recovery personnel, including the Incident
Recovery Team, Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and other engineering,
operations and technical staff members should communicate their location and
status on predetermined bases.
E-mail may also be an effective means of coordination between the Incident
Response Team before, during and after a disaster or other emergency situation.
[Television station] should consider creating e-mail distribution lists so that e-mail
messages are broadcast to all members on the lists. Utilize an external email
service in the case where internal email is completely unavailable.” Consider
30development of an offsite Disaster Portal where people can check in by entering
an update of their own location. These messages could contain notifications about
where to meet, task responsibilities, and resources that may be needed or other
information pertaining to the emergency.
If phones are operative, communications to personnel at home and at work
will be handled by attempting initially to contact personnel directly using the
employee contact information contained in Table 7. In this situation a voice mail
system can also be used to inform personnel of the status of the worksite. If this is
unsuccessful or if the phones are not operative, communications to personnel may
be made using two-way radios, satellite phones, ham radios, e-mail and
messenger system, as deemed appropriate, until such time as the normal phone
service resumes. In some cases, announcements can also be provided to the
radio, television, and print media.
Personnel should be informed in advance whenever this type of resource
will be utilized and directed to the one that will be used to provide information
about [Television station].
Effective planning should take into account that personnel will need to know
whether their families are safe during an emergency, and likewise, families will
want to know that the staff member is safe at the facility. However, personnel
should refrain from tying up telephone lines and thereby impeding necessary
communications. During an emergency, [Television station] may wish to
establish a toll-free number, web site or other means for family members to use to
receive a status update.
External:
During an emergency situation, it is critical to communicate quickly,
accurately and perhaps frequently to a variety of external audiences, such as the
media, local authorities, municipalities, federal agencies (e.g. FCC, FEMA, etc.),
elected officials, opinion leaders, customers, and suppliers.
During and after emergencies, these external entities may frequently
contact [Television station]. These contacts may be general inquiries, requests
for sensitive information, requests for assistance, or they may be for the purpose
of exchanging information of mutual interest. To ensure that communication is
ongoing and shared with those entities touched by the emergency, it is essential
that all such contacts be immediately directed to the local Public Information
Officer, Public Affairs staff, Legal department, or other entity serving as the focal
point for these external communications. [Television station] may also wish to
31consider activating emergency alert systems. The Federal Communications
Commission encourages broadcast licensees to transmit emergency alerts as a
public service.
To facilitate the gathering of information that may be needed by external
entities, a survey form template is provided in Appendix E. The template is not
intended to be comprehensive and [Television station] is encouraged to adapt its
use to accommodate any unique situation that may exist.
Recovery Strategies
All recovery plans should start with an assessment of the vulnerabilities
within [Television station]. It is the responsibility of the Disaster Recovery
Planning Manager to work with [Television station] personnel to identify specific
risks, threats, incidents or situations that may impact ongoing system operations,
and to define the steps to be taken to prevent (Vulnerability Assessment), react
(Disaster Recovery Plan) and respond (Incident Response Plan), to these events
as they occur. These plans are not meant to be long-term restoration efforts, but
rather guidelines to get back on the air as quickly as possible.
After the Vulnerability Assessments are complete and documented, further
planning can take place to develop strategies and solutions to minimize the
vulnerabilities and risks identified, should they be encountered. It is essential that
responsibility for each area of concern be assigned to qualified personnel. It is also
essential that the plan be tested and practiced under realistic conditions to reveal
any weaknesses that may not be initially apparent.
There are nearly an infinite number of natural or man-made disasters or
other emergency situations which could occur including bomb threats,
earthquakes, fire, flooding, gas leaks, hurricanes, tornados, snow storms, etc.
However, while there is any number of situations that could occur, the associated
vulnerabilities and risks can generally be grouped as follows:
The loss of the use of all or critical portions of the facility.
Loss of the transmission facilities.
Loss of access to facilities.
As such, it does not matter why the loss of use or access to a facility
occurs. For example, access to the main facility might be lost due to a hazardous
atmosphere, a local law enforcement action or any number of other emergency
situations. What does matter is the availability of a flexible set of strategies and
plans that are well thought out in advance of the situation. They must be practiced
32and tested periodically, used alone or in groups, to rapidly recover from the
emergency.
Problems that [Television station] could potentially encounter due to an
emergency situation include:
Station On-the-Air / Off-the-Air.
Loss of the transmitter building.
Loss of master control or STL.
Lock down - personnel cannot leave the facilities.
Mandatory evacuations.
Personnel cannot access the facilities or into the building(s).
Transmitter tower issues.
Loss of telephony wired/wireless.
Loss of data networking capabilities.
Loss of communications capabilities to field personnel.
Newsroom computer system failures.
Satellite distribution system failures.
Lawlessness.
Below are just two examples of the many guidelines and procedures you
will need for proper planning in the event of these types of problems. [Television
station] is encouraged to define additional guidelines and procedures to
accommodate additional, as well as any locally unique, emergency situations
using similar forms in this section. Planning for different geographic locations is
also required. Planning for earthquakes in Southern California is a requirement,
but planning for snowstorms is not.

36Appendix A: Pandemic Preparedness
Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
OSHA have developed guidelines, including checklists, to assist businesses,
industries, and other employers in planning for a pandemic outbreak. This
document will reference their recommendations and provide links to the plans
developed by these organizations. Pandemic preparedness should be part of
every disaster recovery plan. Disaster recovery plan disaster reco
From the OSHA documentation:
To reduce the impact of a pandemic on your operations, employees and the
general public, it is important for all businesses and organizations to include
continuity planning for a pandemic. Lack of continuity planning can result in a
cascade of failures as employers attempt to address challenges of a pandemic
with insufficient resources and employees who might not be adequately trained in
the jobs they will be asked to perform. Proper planning will allow employers to
better protect their employees and prepare for changing patterns of commerce and
potential disruptions in supplies or services.
Develop a disaster plan that includes pandemic preparedness, review it regularly
and conduct drills.
Be aware of and review federal, state and local health department
pandemic influenza plans. Incorporate appropriate actions from these plans
into workplace disaster plans.
Prepare and plan for operations with a reduced workforce.
Work with your suppliers to ensure that you can continue to operate and
provide services.
Develop a sick leave policy that does not penalize sick employees, thereby
encouraging employees to stay home so that they do not infect other
employees. Recognize that employees with ill family members may need to
stay home to care for them.
Identify possible exposure and health risks to your employees. Are your
employees expected to have a lot of contact with the general public?
Minimize exposure to fellow employees or the public. For example, will
more of your employees work from home? This may require enhancement
of technology and communications equipment.
Identify business-essential positions and people required to sustain
business-necessary functions and operations. Prepare to cross-train or
develop ways to function in the absence of these positions.
37It is recommended that employers train three or more employees to be able
to sustain business-necessary functions and operations, and communicate
the expectation for available employees to perform these functions if
needed during a pandemic.
Plan for downsizing services but also anticipate any scenario, which may
require a surge in your services.
Recognize that, in the course of normal daily life, all employees will have
non-occupational risk factors at home and in community settings that should
be reduced to the extent possible. Some employees will also have
individual risk factors that should be considered by employers as they plan
how the organization will respond to a potential pandemic (e.g. immuno-
compromised individuals and pregnant women).
Stockpile items such as soap, tissue, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and
recommended personal protective equipment. When stockpiling items, be
aware of each product's shelf life and storage conditions. Make sure that
your disaster plan protects and supports your employees, customers and
the general public. Be aware of your employees' concerns about pay, leave,
safety and health. Informed employees who feel safe at work are less likely
to be absent.
Develop policies and practices that distance employees from each other,
customers and the general public. Consider practices to minimize face-to-
face contact between employees such as e-mail, websites and
teleconferences. Policies and practices that allow employees to work from
home or to stagger their work shifts may be important as absenteeism
rises.
Work with your employees and their union(s) to address leave, pay,
transportation, travel, childcare, absence and other human resource issues.
Provide your employees and customers in your workplace with easy access
to infection control supplies, such as soap, hand sanitizers, personal
protective equipment (such as gloves or surgical masks), tissues, and office
cleaning supplies.
Provide training, education and informational material about business-
essential job functions and employee health and safety, including proper
hygiene practices and the use of any personal protective equipment to be
used in the workplace. Be sure that informational material is available in a
usable format for individuals with sensory disabilities and/or limited English
proficiency. Encourage employees to take care of their health by eating
right, getting plenty of rest and getting a seasonal flu vaccination.
38Work with your insurance companies and state and local health agencies to
provide information to employees and customers about medical care in the
event of a pandemic.
Assist employees in managing additional stressors related to the pandemic.
These are likely to include distress related to personal or family illness, life
disruption, grief related to loss of family, friends or coworkers, loss of routine
support systems, and similar challenges. Assuring timely and accurate
communication will also be important throughout the duration of the pandemic in
decreasing fear or worry. Employers should provide opportunities for support,
counseling, and mental health assessment and referral should these be
necessary. If present, Employee Assistance Programs can offer training and
provide resources and other guidance on mental health and resiliency before and
during a pandemic.

50Section I: Purpose and Objectives
Potential emergencies at [Television station] such as fire, explosion,
hazardous material spill, chemical releases and all other emergency situations
may require personnel to evacuate a facility. An EEP and adequate occupant
familiarity with a facility minimize threats to life and property. This plan applies to
all emergencies where personnel may need to evacuate for personal safety.
This EEP is intended to communicate the policies and procedures for
personnel to follow in an emergency situation. This written plan should be made
available, upon request, to personnel and their designated representatives by the
Emergency Evacuation Coordinator for the facility.
Under this plan, personnel will be informed of:
The plan's purpose.
Preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies.
Emergency escapes procedures and route assignments.
Procedures to be followed by personnel who remain to control critical
plant operations before they evacuate.
Procedures to account for all personnel after an emergency
evacuation has been completed.
Rescue and medical duties for those staff members who perform
them.
The alarm system.
[Name/title] is the Emergency Evacuation Coordinator for this facility and
has overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of this plan.
[Name/title] is the Alternate Emergency Evacuation Coordinator.
The Emergency Evacuation Coordinator, in coordination with the Disaster
Recovery Planning Manager, will review and update the plan as necessary.
Copies of this plan will be maintained in/at: [location]
Section II: General Guidelines
The following guidelines apply to this EEP:
All personnel should be trained in safe evacuation procedures.
Refresher training is required whenever the employee's
responsibilities or designated actions under the plan change, and
whenever the plan itself is changed.
51The training may include use of floor plans and workplace maps that
clearly show the emergency escape routes included in the EEP.
Color-coding aids personnel in determining their route assignments.
Floor plans and maps should be posted at all times in main areas
(i.e. stairwells, lobbies, elevator lobbies, exit corridors) of [Television
station] to provide guidance in an emergency.
Stairwells are the primary means for evacuation. Elevators are to be
used only when authorized by a fire or police officer.
Personnel will not be permitted to re-enter the facility until advised
by the Fire Department.
This EEP will be coordinated with efforts in connected facilities. Mutually
beneficial agreements can be reached regarding designated meeting sites and
shelter in the event of inclement weather.
Section III: Responsibilities of Emergency Evacuation Coordinator and
Safety Monitors
The Emergency Evacuation Coordinator is responsible for:
Obtaining and posting floor plans and route evacuation maps.
Overseeing the development, communication, implementation and
maintenance of the overall EEP.
Ensuring the training of occupants, Safety Monitors, and critical
operations personnel, and notifying all personnel of changes to the
plan.
Maintaining up to date lists of occupants, critical operations
personnel, and any other personnel with assigned duties under this
plan.
In the event of an emergency, relaying applicable information to the
Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, building occupants and Safety
Monitors.
Establishing designated meeting sites for evacuees.
In coordination with the Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, assist
in posting the EEP in work areas, communicating plan to occupants,
and updating the plan annually.
The Safety Monitors are responsible for:
Assisting in familiarizing personnel with emergency evacuation
procedures.
52Acting as liaison between management, the Disaster Recovery
Planning Manager, and the Incident Response Team, and their work
area.
Ensuring that occupants have vacated the premise in the event of an
evacuation and for checking assigned areas.
Knowing where their designated meeting site is and for
communicating this information to building occupants.
Having a list of personnel in their area of coverage to facilitate a
head count at their designated meeting site.
Ensuring that disabled persons and visitors are assisted in
evacuating the facility.
Evaluating and reporting problems to the Emergency Evacuation
Coordinator after an emergency event.
Section IV: Alerting Occupants in Case of Fire or Other Emergency
In case of a fire, personnel should activate the nearest fire alarm box
and/or contact the local fire department. Fire alarm box locations are
noted on the evacuation floor plans in Section X. The alarm will serve
as an alert to building occupants for the need to evacuate.
It may be necessary to activate additional fire alarm boxes or shout
the alarm if people are still in the facility and the alarm has stopped
sounding or if the alarm does not sound. This can be done while
exiting.
Persons discovering a fire, smoky condition, or explosion should pull
the fire alarm box. Any pertinent fire or rescue information should be
conveyed to the Fire Department. All emergency telephone numbers
are listed at the beginning of this EEP.
State your name, your location, and the nature of the call. Speak
slowly and clearly. Wait for the dispatcher to hang up first. On
occasion the dispatcher may need additional information or may
provide you with additional instructions.
Section V: Evacuation Procedures for Facility Occupants
When the fire alarm sounds, all personnel should ensure that nearby
personnel are aware of the emergency, quickly shutdown operating
equipment, close doors, and exit the facility using stairwells.
All occupants should proceed to their Designated Meeting Site and
await further instructions from their Safety Monitor, Emergency
Evacuation Coordinator, Disaster Recovery Planning Manager, or
Incident Response Team member.
53All personnel should know where primary and alternate exits are
located and be familiar with the various available evacuation routes.
Floor plans with escape routes, alternate escape routes, exit
locations and designated meeting sites are located in Section X and
are posted in the facility.
Occupants should NOT use elevators as an escape route in the
event of a fire.
Notes and precautions:
Small fires can be extinguished more effectively if you are trained
to use a fire extinguisher. However, an immediate readiness to
evacuate is essential.
All fires, even those that have been extinguished, should be
reported to the local fire department immediately.
Never enter a room that is smoke filled.
Never enter a room if the door is warm to touch.
R - Rescue: When you discover a fire, rescue people in
immediate danger if you can do so without endangering yourself.
Exit via a safe fire exit. Never use elevators. Close doors to
rooms with fire.
A - Alarm: Sound the alarm by pulling a firebox and call 911 from
a safe distance to notify fire command center of precise location
of fire.
C - Confine: Close all doors, windows and other openings.
E - Evacuate: Evacuate the facility.
Section VI: Disabled Occupants
If a disabled occupant is unable to exit the facility unassisted, the Safety
Monitor should notify the emergency response personnel of the individual’s
location. Transporting of disabled individuals up or down stairwells should be
avoided until emergency response personnel have arrived. Unless imminent life-
threatening conditions exist in the immediate area occupied by a non-ambulatory
or disabled person, relocation of the individual should be limited to a safe area on
the same floor, in close proximity to an evacuation stairwell.
54Section VII: On-Air Operations
Critical operations, including equipment that should be shut off or set-up to
operate unattended, and persons designated to complete these actions are
identified in Table 1. Procedures for these transition activities should be
predetermined for life safety and loss control purposes, as well as ensuring
complete evacuations in a timely manner.

The shutdown procedure to be followed by those employees who have
been assigned to care for essential [Television station] operations include: On-
air; News Studio Operations; News Gathering; Sales and Human Resources.
Individuals involved in these transition procedures should be notified by
management of this responsibility in advance. They should be identified in the
EEP, and appropriately trained for the particular situation. Of course alternate
personnel should be identified as well.
Section VIII: Accountability Procedures for Emergency Evacuation
Groups working together on or in the same area should meet outside and
away from the facility in the prearranged designated meeting site. A list of the
primary and alternate designated meeting sites is listed on the floor plans in
Section X.
A roster of personnel to ensure that everyone has evacuated has been
developed by the Emergency Evacuations Coordinator. The list will be updated
whenever there is a personnel change.
55Safety Monitors are designated by the Emergency Coordinator and/or the
Disaster Recovery Planning Manager and will conduct head counts once
evacuation has been completed. There should be at least one Safety Monitor per
floor or per twenty occupants to provide adequate guidance and instruction at the
time of an emergency.
Personnel selected as Safety Monitors are to be trained in the complete
workplace layout and the various primary and alternate escape routes from the
workplace. All trained personnel are made aware of employees with disabilities
who may need extra assistance and of hazardous areas to be avoided during
emergencies. Before leaving, the Safety Monitors are to check rooms and other
enclosed spaces in the workplace for other staff members who may be trapped or
otherwise unable to evacuate the area, and convey this information to emergency
personnel. A list of Safety Monitors and Alternate Safety Monitors for [Television
station] appears in Table 2.

Section IX: Training and Communications
Each occupant should know that evacuation is necessary and what his/her
role is in carrying out the plan. Personnel should also know what is expected of
them during an emergency to assure their safety.
A method of training occupants in the requirements of the EEP is to give all
personnel a thorough briefing and demonstration. Managers and supervisors
should present this plan to personnel in staff meetings. Annual practice drills are to
be implemented and documented by the Emergency Evacuation Coordinator
and/or Disaster Recovery Planning Manager.
The Emergency Evacuation Coordinator and/or Disaster Recovery Planning
Manager should maintain training attendance records.
