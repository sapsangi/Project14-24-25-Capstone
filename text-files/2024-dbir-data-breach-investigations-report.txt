This year, the report is delving deeper 
into the pathway to breaches in an 
effort to identify the most likely Action 
and vector groupings that lead to 
breaches given the current threat 
landscape. The cracked doorway on the 
cover is meant to represent the various 
ways attackers can make their way 
inside. The opening in the door shows 
the pattern of our combined “ways-in” 
percentages (see Figure 7 for a more 
straightforward representation), and 
it lets out a band of light displaying a 
pattern of the Action vector quantities. 
The inner cover highlights and labels 
the quantities in a less abstract way. 
Hope you enjoy our art house phase.4

Greetings! Welcome to Verizon’s 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR). 
This year marks the 17th edition of this publication, and we are thrilled to welcome 
back our old friends and say hello to new readers. As always, the aim of the DBIR is 
to shine a light on the various Actor types, the tactics they utilize and the targets they 
choose. Thanks to our talented, generous and civic-minded contributors from around 
the world who continue to stick with us and share their data and insight, and deep 
appreciation for our very own Verizon Threat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC) 
team (rock stars that they are). These two groups enable us to examine and analyze 
relevant trends in cybercrime that play out on a global stage across organizations of 
all sizes and types.
From year to year, we see new and innovative attacks as well as variations on tried-
and-true attacks that still remain successful. From the exploitation of well-known 
and far-reaching zero-day vulnerabilities, such as the one that affected MOVEit, to 
the much more mundane but still incredibly effective Ransomware and Denial of 
Service (DoS) attacks, criminals continue to do their utmost to prove the old adage 
“crime does not pay” wrong.
The shifting landscape of cyber threats can be confusing and overwhelming. When, 
in addition to the attack types mentioned above, one throws in factors such as the 
human element and/or poorly protected passwords, things become even more 
confused. One might be forgiven for viewing the current state of cybersecurity 
as a colorful cyber Mardi Gras parade. Enterprise floats of all shapes and sizes 
cruising past a large crowd of threat actors who are shouting out gleefully “Throw 
me some creds!” Of course, human nature being what it is, all too often, the folks 
on the floats do just that. And, as with all such parades, what is left in the aftermath 
isn’t necessarily pretty. The past year has been a busy one for cybercrime. We 
analyzed 30,458 real-world security incidents, of which 10,626 were confirmed data 
breaches (a record high!), with victims spanning 94 countries.
While the general structure of the report remains the same, long-time readers may 
notice a few changes. For example, the “first-time reader” section is now located in 
Appendix A rather than at the beginning of the report. But we do encourage those 
who are new to the DBIR to give it a read-through before diving into the report. It 
should help you get your bearings.
Last, but certainly not least, we extend a most sincere thanks yet again to our 
contributors (without whom we could not do this) and to our readers (without whom 
there would be no point in doing it).
Sincerely,
The Verizon DBIR Team 
C. David Hylender, Philippe Langlois, Alex Pinto, Suzanne Widup
Very special thanks to:
– Christopher Novak for his continued support and insight

About the 2024 DBIR incident dataset
Each year, the DBIR timeline for in-scope incidents is from November 1 of one 
calendar year through October 31 of the next calendar year. Thus, the incidents 
described in this report took place between November 1, 2022, and October 31, 
2023. The 2023 caseload is the primary analytical focus of the 2024 report, but 
the entire range of data is referenced throughout, notably in trending graphs. The 
time between the latter date and the date of publication for this report is spent in 
acquiring the data from our global contributors, anonymizing and aggregating that 
data, analyzing the dataset, and finally creating the graphics and writing the report. 
The jokes, sadly, do not write themselves.

Figure 2. Ransomware and Extortion breaches over time
Summary of findings
Our ways-in analysis witnessed a 
substantial growth of attacks involving 
the exploitation of vulnerabilities as the 
critical path to initiate a breach when 
compared to previous years. It almost 
tripled (180% increase) from last year, 
which will come as no surprise to 
anyone who has been following the 
effect of MOVEit and similar zero-day 
vulnerabilities. These attacks were 
primarily leveraged by Ransomware 
and other Extortion-related threat 
actors. As one might imagine, the main 
vector for those initial entry points was 
Web applications.
2024 DBIR Summary of findingsFigure 1. Select ways-in enumerations in non-Error, non-Misuse breaches 
(n=6,963)
Roughly one-third of all breaches 
involved Ransomware or some other 
Extortion technique. Pure Extortion 
attacks have risen over the past year 
and are now a component of 9% of 
all breaches. The shift of traditional 
ransomware actors toward these newer 
techniques resulted in a bit of a decline 
in Ransomware to 23%. However, when 
combined, given that they share threat 
actors, they represent a strong growth 
to 32% of breaches. Ransomware was 
a top threat across 92% of industries.8
 2024 DBIR Summary of findingsWe have revised our calculation of the 
involvement of the human element to 
exclude malicious Privilege Misuse in 
an effort to provide a clearer metric of 
what security awareness can affect. For 
this year’s dataset, the human element 
was a component of 68% of breaches, 
roughly the same as the previous period 
described in the 2023 DBIR.
In this issue, we are introducing an 
expanded concept of a breach involving 
a third party that includes partner 
infrastructure being affected and 
direct or indirect software supply chain 
issues—including when an organization 
is affected by vulnerabilities in third-
party software. In short, those are 
breaches an organization could 
potentially mitigate or prevent by trying 
to select vendors with better security 
track records. We see this figure at 
15% this year, a 68% increase from the 
previous year, mostly fueled by the use 
of zero-day exploits for Ransomware 
and Extortion attacks.
Our dataset saw a growth of breaches 
involving Errors, now at 28%, as we 
broadened our contributor base to 
include several new mandatory breach 
notification entities. This validates 
our suspicion that errors are more 
prevalent than media or traditional 
incident response-driven bias would 
lead us to believe.

Figure 4. Phishing email report rate by click status
2024 DBIR Summary of findingsFinancially motivated threat actors will 
typically stick to the attack techniques 
that will give them the most return  
on investment.
Over the past three years, the 
combination of Ransomware and 
other Extortion breaches accounted 
for almost two-thirds (fluctuating 
between 59% and 66%) of those 
attacks. According to the FBI’s 
Internet Crime Complaint Center 
(IC3) ransomware complaint data, 
the median loss associated with the 
combination of Ransomware and 
other Extortion breaches has been 
$46,000, ranging between $3 (three 
dollars) and $1,141,467 for 95% of the 
cases. We also found from ransomware 
negotiation data contributors that 
the median ratio of initially requested 
ransom and company revenue is 1.34%, 
but it fluctuated between 0.13% and 
8.30% for 80% of the cases.
Similarly, over the past two years, we 
have seen incidents involving Pretexting 
(the majority of which had Business 
Email Compromise [BEC] as the 
outcome) accounting for one-fourth 
(ranging between 24% and 25%) of 
financially motivated attacks. In both 
years, the median transaction amount 
of a BEC was around $50,000, also 
according to the FBI IC3 dataset.The overall reporting rate of Phishing 
has been growing over the past few 
years. In security awareness exercise 
data contributed by our partners during 
2023, 20% of users reported phishing 
in simulation engagements, and 11% 
of the users who clicked the email 
also reported. This is welcome news 
because on the flip side, the median 
time to click on a malicious link after the 
email is opened is 21 seconds and then 
only another 28 seconds for the person 
caught in the phishing scheme to enter 
their data. This leads to an alarming 
finding: The median time for users  
to fall for phishing emails is less than  
60 seconds. Figure 4. Phishing email report rate by click status

Results  
and analysis11
 2024 DBIR Results and analysisResults  
and analysis: 
Introduction
Hello, friends, and welcome to the “Results and analysis” section. This is where we 
cover the highlights we found in the data this year. This dataset is collected from a 
variety of sources, including our own VTRAC investigators, reports provided by our 
data contributors and publicly disclosed security incidents.1
Because data contributors come and go, one of our priorities is to make sure 
we can get broad representation on different types of security incidents and the 
countries where they occur. This ebb and flow of contributors obviously influences 
our dataset, and we will do our best to provide context on those potential biases 
where applicable.
This year we onboarded a good number of new contributors and reached an 
exciting milestone of more than 10,000 breaches analyzed in a single edition.2  
It is an enormous amount of work to organize and analyze, but it is also incredibly 
gratifying to be able to present these results to you.
In an attempt to be more actionable, we would like to use this section to discuss 
some high-level findings that transcend the fixed structure of the Vocabulary 
for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS) 4As (Actor, Action, Asset and 
Attribute) and expand on some of the key findings we have been highlighting over 
the past few years.
1 Have you checked out the VERIS Community Database (VCDB) yet? You should, it’s awesome! 
(https://verisframework.org/vcdb.html)
2 We also passed our cumulative 1 million incident milestone as we forecast in the 2023 DBIR, but 
we are only mentioning this here in the footnote to not aggravate the report; it was very 
disappointed that 1 million is not enough to retire on in this economy.
3 We’re not throwing shade—different types of contributing organizations focus on what is most 
relevant for them, as well they should.Ways into  
your sensitive 
data’s heart 
One of the actionable perspectives 
we have created has been the ways-
in analysis, in which we try to make 
sense of the initial steps into breaches 
to help predict how to best avoid or 
prevent them. We still have plenty 
of unknown Actions and vectors 
dispersed throughout the dataset as 
investigation processes and disclosure 
patterns widely differ across our data 
contributors,3 but this view of what we 
know for sure has remained stable and 
representative over the years.
Figure 6 paints a clear picture of what 
has been the biggest pain point for 
everyone this year. This 180% increase 
in the exploitation of vulnerabilities 
as the critical path action to initiate a 
breach will be of no surprise to anyone 
who has been following the MOVEit 
vulnerability and other zero-day exploits 
that were leveraged by Ransomware 
and Extortion-related threat actors.
This was the sort of result we were 
expecting in the 2023 DBIR when 
we analyzed the impact of the Log4j 
vulnerabilities. That anticipated worst 
case scenario discussed in the last 
report materialized this year with this 
lesser known—but widely deployed—
product. We will be diving into additional 
details of MOVEit and vulnerability 
exploitation in the “Action” and “System 
Intrusion” pattern sections.Figure 6 . Select ways-in enumerations in non-Error, non-Misuse breaches over time12
 2024 DBIR Results and analysisTo dig further into this concept of the 
ways in, we are presenting a new slice 
of the data, where we are overlaying 
those different types of Actions with 
their most popular vectors to help  
focus response and planning efforts. 
You can take a peek at those results  
in Figure 7.
Phishing attacks mostly having an 
Email vector is rather self-explanatory,4 
so we would like to focus on the 
concentration of the Web application 
vector prevalence for both credentials 
and exploit vulnerability. The presence 
of Credentials in the graphic should 
not be surprising as it carries a large 
share of the guilt for our Basic Web 
Application Attacks pattern (i.e., getting 
unauthorized access to cloud-based 
email and collaboration accounts). 
But recency bias might make folks 
doubt the prevalence of exploitation of 
vulnerabilities. Because this report is 
being written in the beginning of 2024, 
the focus has been on zero-day (or 
near-zero-day) vulnerabilities in virtual 
private network (VPN) software.5
Naturally, the share of VPN vector in the 
exploit vuln variety will likely increase 
for our 2025 report to reflect those 
trends, but the bottom line is again self-
evident and self-explanatory. Anything 
that adds to your attack surface on the 
internet can be targeted and potentially 
be the first foothold for an external 
threat actor, and as such, the focus 
should be to try to keep footholds to  
a minimum.
No matter how you feel about your VPN 
software right now, having as many 
of your web applications as possible 
behind it might be a better strategy 
than having to worry about emergency 
overnight patching of the software—
and all the other dependencies 
that power the web applications 
themselves. This will not completely 
mitigate the risk and will not be the 
4 And an incredible L for the *ishing portmanteau enthusiasts
5 Unless by now we have successfully ripped them out of our networks entirely and are back to 
our smoke signals and carrier pigeon ways.
6 We ourselves were just talking about the growth of exploitation of vulnerabilities as a pathway 
into breaches.
7 We dread to think what “awareness training” for malicious insiders would look like.right fit for all organizations, but in the 
worst-case scenario, the Cybersecurity 
Infrastructure and Security Agency 
(CISA) might have you rip out only one 
tool from your network as opposed  
to several.
Anyway, all this nuance does not affect 
our opinion of having desktop sharing 
software directly connected to the 
internet. Go fix that pronto, please.
We are only 
human after all.
One other combined metric we 
have been tracking for a few years 
is related to the human element in 
breaches. There is a lot of focus on 
how fully automated attacks can ruin 
an organization’s day,6 but it is often 
surprising how much the people inside 
the company can have a positive effect 
on security outcomes.
This year, we have tweaked our human 
element metric a bit so its impact and 
action opportunities are clearer. You 
see, when DBIR authors (and the whole 
industry in general) would discuss 
this metric, it would be alongside an 
opportunity gap for security training 
and awareness. It is not perfect, but if 
you had a clear investment path that 
could potentially improve the outcomes 
of more than two-thirds of potential 
breaches, you might at least sit down 
and listen.
It turns out that our original formula 
for what was included in the human 
element metric built in Privilege 
Misuse pattern breaches, which 
are the cases involving malicious 
insiders. Having those mixed with 
honest mistakes by employees did 
not make sense if our aim was to 
suggest that those could be mitigated 
by security awareness training.7

9 In a surprising role reversal, as we are often very pedantic in our definitions
2024 DBIR Results and analysisFigure 8 showcases the new human 
element over time (with malicious 
insiders removed) to provide a better 
frame of reference for our readers 
going forward. It is present in more 
than two-thirds of breaches as 
foreshadowed two paragraphs ago, 
more precisely in 68% of breaches. 
It is statistically similar to our findings 
last year, which means that in a 
certain way, the increases we had 
across the board in the Miscellaneous 
Errors pattern (human-centric) and 
as a result of the MOVEit vulnerability 
(automated) were similar in scope 
as far as this metric is concerned.
Fans of the “original flavor” human 
element are not missing much because 
the inclusion of the Misuse action 
would have brought the percentage 
to 76%, statistically only slightly more 
than the previous report’s 74%. Still, 
we prefer the clearer definition going 
forward, and we will leave the analysis 
of those bothersome insiders and their 
misdeeds to the “Privilege Misuse” 
pattern section.
The weakest 
links in the 
chain of inter­
connection
Finally, as we review the big picture of 
how the threat landscape changed this 
year,8 we would like to introduce a new 
metric that we will be tracking going 
forward. As the growth of exploitation 
of vulnerabilities and software supply 
chain attacks make them more 
commonplace in security risk register 
discussions, we would like to suggest 
a new third-party metric where we embrace the broadest possible 
interpretation of the term.9 Have a peek 
at Figure 9, where we calculated a 
supply chain interconnection influence 
in 15% of the breaches we saw, a 
significant growth from 9% last year. 
A 68% year-over-year growth is really 
solid, but what do we mean by this?
Figure 9 . Supply chain interconnection in breaches over timeFor a breach to be a part of the supply 
chain interconnection metric, it will 
have taken place because either a 
business partner was the vector of 
entry for the breach (like the now 
fabled heating, ventilating and air-
conditioning [HVAC] company entry 
point in the 2013 Target breach) or 
if the data compromise happened 
Figure 8 . Human element enumeration in breaches over time14
in a third-party data processor or 
custodian site (fairly common in the 
MOVEit cases, for instance). Less 
frequently found in our dataset, but 
also included, are physical breaches 
in a partner company facility or even 
partner vehicles hijacked to gain 
entry to an organization’s facilities.10
So far, this seems like a pretty standard 
third-party breach recipe, but we are 
also adding cases, such as SolarWinds 
and 3CX, in which their software 
development processes were hijacked 
and malicious software updates 
were pushed to their customers to 
be potentially leveraged in a second 
step escalation by the threat actors. 
Those breaches are ultimately caused 
by the initial incident in the software 
development partner, and so we are 
adding those to this tab.
Now for the controversial part: 
Exploitation of vulnerabilities is counted 
in this metric as well. As much as we 
can argue that the software developers 
are also victims when vulnerabilities 
are disclosed in their software (and 
sure, they are), the incentives might 
not be aligned properly for those 
developers to handle this seemingly 
interminable task. These quality control 
failures can disproportionately affect 
the customers who use this software. 
We can clearly see what powerful 
and wide-reaching effects a handful 
of zero-day or mismanaged patching 
rollouts had on the general threat 
landscape. We stopped short of adding 
exploitation of misconfigurations 
in installed software because, 
although those could be a result of 
insecure defaults, system admins 
can get quite creative sometimes.
10 We should stop watching those “Mission: Impossible” movies during DBIR writing season.
2024 DBIR Results and analysisFigure 10 . Action varieties in selected 
supply chain interconnection breaches 
(n=1,075)Figure 10 shows the breakdown 
of VERIS actions in the supply 
chain metric and, as expected, 
it is driven by Exploit vuln, which 
ushers Ransomware and Extortion 
attacks into organizations.
This metric ultimately represents a 
failure of community resilience and 
recognition of how organizations 
depend on each other. Every time 
a choice is made on a partner (or 
software provider) by your organization 
and it fails you, this metric goes up. 
We recommend that organizations 
start looking at ways of making 
better choices so as to not reward 
the weakest links in the chain. In a 
time where disclosure of breaches is 
becoming mandatory, we might finally 
have the tools and information to help 
measure the security effectiveness of 
our prospective partners.
We will keep a close watch on this 
one and seek to improve its definition 
over time. We welcome feedback 
and suggestions of alternative 
angles, and we believe the only 
way through it is to find ways to 
hold repeat offenders accountable 
and reward resilient software and 
services with our business.15
Hey, you, don’t skip this section this 
year! We know we keep repeating, 
“It’s always external criminals wanting 
your money” alongside dated pop 
culture references, but we have some 
interesting data points to discuss this 
year. Does this mean External actors 
are not the most prevalent? No, of 
course they are, silly. But since we got 
your attention, please read on.
This year, in part because of improved 
breach collection processes11 and the 
onboarding of new data contributors 
documenting mandatory breach 
disclosures, it is finally time for Internal 
actors to shine. After all, why rely  
on outside help if you have the  
talent in-house?
We still have the External actors as the 
top catalyst for breaches at 65%, but 
we have Internal at a whopping 35%—a 
significant increase from last year’s 
20% number. Figure 11 showcases this 
development over the last few years.
However, before we call an emergency 
meeting and start pointing fingers at 
each other trying to figure out who the 
impostor is, it’s important to realize that 
73% of those Internal actor breaches 
were in the Miscellaneous Errors 
pattern, and we shouldn’t really be 
holding their feet to the fire.12 We will 
be discussing more about this Error 
renaissance13 in the respective pattern 
section, but it showcases one long-
standing suspicion of the team that 
mandatory breach disclosure at scale 
will help us better understand how 
mundane and preventable some  
of those incidents can be.And speaking of disclosure, the 
numerous Extortion attacks used by 
ransomware actors have caused an 
influx of the numbers of external actor 
incidents we review each year because 
they tip the hands of their victims and 
force them to notify their customers 
of the breach. This helped us keep our 
dataset balanced. Further mandatory 
disclosure regulation trends in the 
world will help us all understand the 
causal landscape better.14
Before anyone gets excited by more 
groundbreaking changes in the “Actor” 
section, Figure 12 is pleased to inform 
you that the Actor motive ranking 
remains the same. Financial has the 
clear lead, but it is interesting to note 
that the Espionage motive has increased 
slightly over last year, from 5% to 7%. 
As was the case in the prior report, this 
motive is mostly concentrated in Public 
Administration breaches.
11 Doubling the number of breaches we analyzed was no easy feat. We feel sorry for the poor DBIR 
authors who will have to outdo that number for the 2025 edition.
12 Unless carelessness and inattention to detail are wrong.
13 Errorssance? Age of Enerrorment?
14 This will also give threat actors new opportunities to be tattletales and report material breaches to 
organizations like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

16 https://verisframework.org/actors.htmlFigure 13. Threat actor varieties in 
breaches (n=7,921)
2024 DBIR Results and analysisWe can find the same expected results 
when we consider the varieties of threat 
actors with which we are dealing. Figure 
13 illustrates the lead that Organized 
crime-affiliated actors enjoy over 
their State-sponsored counterparts, 
as our analysis has shown for many 
years. Please don’t misunderstand: 
This in no way means that the threat 
from those Actors should be taken 
lightly. State-sponsored actors are 
unusually resourceful and capable 
of adapting their tactics. Luckily 
for the average organization, they 
are less likely to target run-of-the-
mill enterprises as often as your 
everyday, garden-variety criminal.
On a different note, End-user (in 
VERIS parlance, an average employee 
or contractor of an organization) 
has grown a lot, more than doubling 
from 11% to 26%. Those were mostly 
involved in Misdelivery errors and 
were part of the same growth in the 
Miscellaneous Errors pattern we 
discussed above. All in all, it’s been an 
upsetting year for all detail-oriented 
perfectionists15 out there.Actor categories16
External: External threats 
originate from sources outside 
of the organization and its 
network of partners. Examples 
include criminal groups, lone 
hackers, former employees 
and government entities. This 
category also includes God (as 
in “acts of”), “Mother Nature” 
and random chance. Typically, 
no trust or privilege is implied for 
external entities.
Internal: Internal threats are 
those originating from within the 
organization. This encompasses 
company full-time employees, 
independent contractors, interns 
and other staff. Insiders are 
trusted and privileged (some 
more than others).
Partner: Partners include any 
third party sharing a business 
relationship with the organization. 
This includes suppliers, vendors, 
hosting providers and outsourced 
IT support. Some level of trust 
and privilege is usually implied 
between business partners. 
Note that an attacker could use 
a partner as a vector, but that 
does not make the partner the 
Actor in this case. The partner 
has to initiate the incident to be 
considered the responsible party.17
 2024 DBIR Results and analysisArtificial general intelligence 
threat landscape, emphasis on 
“artificial,” not “intelligence”
Despite the pressure from a vocal 
minority of the cybersecurity 
community,17 it seems that the DBIR 
team will not be adding “Evil AGI”18 to 
the VERIS actor enumerations in 2024. 
However, it is still a very timely topic 
and one that has been occupying the 
minds of technology and cybersecurity 
executives worldwide.19
We did keep an eye out for any 
indications of the use of the emerging 
field of generative artificial intelligence 
(GenAI) in attacks and the potential 
effects of those technologies, but 
nothing materialized in the incident data 
we collected globally.20
After performing text analysis alongside 
our criminal forums data contributors, 
we could obviously see the interest in 
GenAI (as in any other forum, really), but 
the number of mentions of GenAI terms 
alongside traditional attack types and 
vectors such as “phishing,” “malware,” 
“vulnerability” and “ransomware” were 
shockingly low, barely breaching 100 
cumulative mentions over the past 
two years. Most of the mentions21 
involved the selling of accounts to 
commercial GenAI offerings or tools 
for AI generation of non-consensual 
pornography. Figure 14 illustrates  
our findings.If you extrapolate the commonly 
understood use cases of GenAI 
technology, it could potentially help 
with the development of phishing, 
malware and the discovery of new 
vulnerabilities in much the same 
way it helps your 10th grader write 
that book report for school or your 
average AI social media influencer 
pretend to create a website by taking 
a picture of a drawing on a napkin.
But would this kind of assistance 
really move the needle on successful 
attacks? One can argue, given our 
Social Engineering pattern numbers 
from the past few years, that Phishing 
or Pretexting attacks don’t need to be 
more sophisticated to be successful 
against their targets, as we have seen 
with the growth of BEC-like attacks. 
Similarly, malware, especially of the 
Ransomware flavor, does not seem to 
be lacking in effectiveness, and threat 
actors seem to have a healthy supply 
of zero-day vulnerabilities for initial 
infiltration into an organization.
From our perspective, the threat actors 
might well be experimenting and trying 
to come up with GenAI solutions to 
their problems. There is evidence 
being published22 of leveraging such 
technologies in “learning how to code” 
activities by known state-sponsored 
threat actors. But it really doesn’t look 
like a breakthrough is imminent or 
that any attack-side optimizations this might bring would even register on the 
incident response side of things. The 
only exception here has to do with the 
clear advancements on deepfake-like 
technology, which has already created 
a good deal of reported fraud and 
misinformation anecdotes.
Incidentally, we did ask one of those 
GenAI tools what threats this nascent 
technology could amplify, and it ended 
up suggesting the same things as 
above.23 It made it seem like it already 
had an outsize influence in those 
subjects and that “organizations must 
adapt their defense strategies to keep 
pace with the evolving sophistication 
of GenAI-driven threats.”24 This little 
experiment seems to indicate that 
even GenAI has a tendency toward 
beefing up its resume via the use 
of well-placed exaggeration.
Turns out it’s really hard to escape the 
hype no matter where you sit on the 
natural vs. artificial divide.

20 But if we had been taken over by an evil AI technology, that is what we would say. Makes  
you think.
21 It is worth pointing out that while we were writing this section, Kaspersky came up with similar 
research that is worth a look: https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2024_new-

circus and theater jokes and puns. Is that what we sound like?

2024 DBIR Results and analysisA wise person25 once said, “We are 
what we repeatedly do,” and wouldn’t 
they be impressed by the stoicism of 
how some of our top VERIS Actions 
keep showing up year after year? In all 
fairness, it does seem more an exercise 
of “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” than any 
classical philosophical principle. But it 
highlights that we defenders have a lot 
of work to do, as usual.
Figure 15 has our top Action varieties 
in breaches, and it brings a lot to 
talk about. As we mentioned in the 
“Introduction” section, a big shift this 
year was the reduction of the Use of 
stolen credentials as a percentage 
of initial actions in breaches. It is still 
our top action at 24%, although it just 
barely passes statistical testing when 
compared to our good old Ransomware 
in the second spot, with 23%.
Ransomware is less representative 
than last year, although its common 
style of financially motivated breach 
is being complemented by Extortion, 
which now represents 9% of our action 
distribution. If you count Ransomware 
breaches and breaches with Extortion 
from ransomware actors as just two 
sides of the same coin,26 we show a 
combined activity of 32% from those 
action varieties.
You can also see Extortion hand in hand 
with Exploit vuln at 10% of breaches, 
and the pair of them headline MOVEit’s 
(and other similar vulnerabilities’) 
impact, along with some other malware- 
and hacking-related varieties, such 
as Backdoor or C2 (command and 
control). That is double the exploitation 
of vulnerabilities of last year, and that 
obviously has had an impact in our 
ways-in metric as discussed in the 
introduction. Readers can find more 
details about this remarkable event in 
our “System Intrusion” pattern section.VERIS Actions
One other thing worth noting is the 
clear overtaking of Pretexting as a more 
likely social action than Phishing. If you 
have been tracking our chronicle of the 
rise of BEC attacks, you know this is 
a viable and scalable way to address 
threat actor monetization anxieties.27
Figure 15 . Top Action varieties in 
breaches (n=9,982)
25 Since every quote on the Internet is misattributed, let’s just save some time and take the easy  
way out.
26 Which we kind of do in this issue of the report because it is exhausting to argue with people all 
the time about things like threat actor methodology details or tactics, techniques and procedures 
(TTPs) when everyone else seems to be doing it. 
27 Unfortunately, everyone has to hit their quotas each quarter.
28 https://verisframework.org/actions.html19
29 We do try in the “Denial of Service” pattern section regardless.
30 “Extorware”? What would be the best couples name for this pair?
2024 DBIR Results and analysisMoving on to Figure 16, we have a 
chance to look into top Action varieties 
for incidents. It should not surprise 
any returning reader of the prevalence 
of DoS attacks in the top spot, being 
present in 59% of our recorded 
incidents. There is very little we can say 
about this Action variety that we haven’t 
said before29 as its lead has been quite 
stable over the years.
We can also observe the same 
phenomena in Ransomware that we 
saw in breaches. It is overall lower 
than last year, being present in 12%  
of incidents, but when you combine it 
with Extortion, we hit a similar ratio to 
last year’s 15% of “Ramstortion.”30
Figure 17 showcases the Action vectors 
in breaches, and the results are in line 
with what we have been discussing in 
the “Introduction” and “Actors” sections. 
There was considerable growth of 
Carelessness due to the increase in 
error breaches and an uptick in Email 
as a vector driven by the increase in 
pretexting. Web applications is hanging 
in there, though, and as we discussed 
in the introduction, it goes hand in hand 
alongside use of stolen credentials and 
exploitation of vulnerabilities to infiltrate 
your defenses.

31 The obvious “ways-out” pun doesn’t make sense here. Maybe if we had cyber getaway cars.
2024 DBIR Results and analysisOver the past year, CISA has been 
leading the secure by design software 
development revolution. We have 
issued alerts documenting foreign 
intelligence agencies penetrating 
hundreds of critical infrastructure 
entities and establishing a foothold, 
possibly to be used in a future conflict. 
We have also published blueprints 
for what we need to change in order 
to establish a culture of technology 
development that puts security first 
without sacrificing innovation. These 
two efforts are different and necessary 
approaches to the same problem.
Today, the software industry is focused 
on the malicious actors and how 
they work. As a community, we talk 
about signature adversary moves, 
the amount of money made and the 
vulnerabilities that were exploited. But it’s that last point—vulnerabilities 
that were exploited—that doesn’t get 
nearly enough focus. Most software 
vulnerabilities are not unknown, unique 
or novel. Instead, they fall into well-
known classes of vulnerabilities, and 
unfortunately, we continue to see the 
same classes of vulnerabilities that 
have been identified for decades.
Our goal should be to shift away from 
focusing on individual vulnerabilities 
and to instead consider the issue 
from a strategic lens. By focusing on 
recurring classes of software defects, 
we can inspire software developers to 
improve the tools, technologies, and 
processes and attack software quality 
problems at the root. I hope that a 
deeper understanding of how attackers 
get in will be the catalyst to demand 
that our technology be secure by 
design starting today.Jen Easterly

Agency (CISA)Speaking of ways in, it might also 
be interesting to explore a handful 
of goals and outcomes of those 
attacks.31 Figure 18 describes the 
prevalence of ransomware/extortion 
and pretexting action varieties under 
the Financial actor motive. As we 
frequently point out, those are two of 
the most successful ways of monetizing 
a breach. The ransom duo has been 
hovering around the two-thirds mark 
(62%) for some time, while Pretexting 
made up nearly a quarter (24%) of goal 
actions over the past two years.

ediateVulnerabilitiesforInternetAccessibleSystems_S508C.pdfBut before organizations start pointing 
at themselves saying, “It’s me, hi, 
I’m the problem,” we must remind 
ourselves that after following a sensible 
risk-based analysis,38 enterprise patch 
management cycles usually stabilize 
around 30 to 60 days as the viable 
target, with maybe a 15-day target for 
critical vulnerability patching. Sadly, this 
does not seem to keep pace with the 
growing speed of threat actor scanning 
and exploitation of vulnerabilities.Exploitation 
moving swiftly 
in the threat 
landscape
The DBIR is entering its Vulnerability 
Era. One of the most critical findings 
we had this year was the growth of the 
Exploit vuln action variety. We have 
emphasized the fact that credential 
abuse is the big thing to focus on for 
several years now,32 and even the most 
obtuse of us can see a trend when it is 
smacking us in the face.
We knew that the MOVEit vulnerability 
was trouble when it first entered the 
room, and we were able to identify 
1,567 breach notifications that related 
to MOVEit by a combination of (very 
vague) breach descriptions and the 
timing of the breach itself. Reports from 
CISA33 state that the Cl0p ransomware 
team had compromised more than 
8,00034 global organizations from 
a handful of zero-day vulnerabilities 
being exploited. It is important to 
mention this high number even if 
our sampled incident dataset does 
not account for all of that in either 
breach notifications or ransomware 
victim listings scraped from the threat 
actor’s own notification websites.35
This love story between zero-day 
vulnerabilities and ransomware threat 
actors puts us all in a concerning 
place. By doing a survival analysis36 
of vulnerability management data and 
focusing on the vulnerabilities in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities 
(KEV) catalog,37 (arguably an area 
of priority focus in vulnerability 
management), we found that it takes 
around 55 days to remediate 50% of 
those critical vulnerabilities once their 
patches are available. As Figure 19 
demonstrates, the patching doesn’t 
seem to start picking up until after  
the 30-day mark, and by the end of  
a whole year, around 8% of them are 
still open.Figure 19 . Survival analysis of CISA KEV vulnerabilities

40 Have a look at the “Introduction” subsection in this “Results and analysis” section.
41 https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-designWe recommend that folks who are 
involved in both software development 
and software procurement take the 
time to review the recently updated 
“Secure by Design”41 report by CISA 
and 17 U.S. and international partners. 
It shows how software can be made 
to have better security outcomes and 
what to look for as a buyer. The DBIR 
does not intend to foster any bad blood 
with software providers that might be 
falling short of their goals in keeping 
their products safe, but if there ever 
was a clear time to make a statement 
by prioritizing this elegant solution to a 
growing threat, this is it. We can see the 
costs of not acting all too well.This is not enough to shake the risk off. 
As we pointed out in the 2023 DBIR, 
the infamous Log4j vulnerability had 
nearly a third (32%) of its scanning 
activity happening in the first 30 days 
of its disclosure. The industry was very 
efficient in mitigating and patching 
affected systems so the damage was 
minimized, but we cannot realistically 
expect an industrywide response 
of that magnitude for every single 
vulnerability that comes along, be it 
zero-day or not.
In fact, if you look at the distribution 
of when vulnerabilities have their first 
scan seen in internet honeypots on 
Figure 20, the median time for that to 
happen for a Common Vulnerabilities 
and Exposures (CVE) registered 
vulnerability in the CISA KEV is five 
days. On the other hand, the median 
time for non-CISA KEV vulnerabilities 
sits at 68 days. There is an obvious “no 
true Scotsman” fallacy comment to be 
made here because when exploitation 
starts running rampant, vulnerabilities 
get added to the KEV. There are few 
hindsight metrics as powerful as this 
one to guide what you should be 
patching first.39 In summary, if it goes 
into the KEV, go fix it ASAP.
Even though this survival analysis 
chart looks bleak, this is the optimist’s 
view of the situation. We must remind 
ourselves that these are companies 
with resources to at least hire a 
vulnerability management vendor. That 
tells us that they care about the risk and 
are taking measures to address it. The 
overall reality is much worse, and as 
more ransomware threat actors adopt 
zero-day and/or recent vulnerabilities, 
they will definitely fill the blank space 
in their notification websites with your 
organization’s name.If we can’t patch the vulnerabilities 
faster, it seems like the only logical 
conclusion is to have fewer of them 
to patch. We realize this is the stuff 
of our wildest dreams, but at the very 
least, organizations should be holding 
their software vendors accountable 
for the security outcomes of their 
product, even if there is no regulatory 
pressure on those vendors to do 
better. The DBIR will emphasize this 
point going forward by expanding our 
third-party involvement in breaches 
metric to also account for the 
exploitation of vulnerabilities.40 This 
helps illustrate that when choosing 
a vendor, software that is secure by 
design would make a difference.Figure 20 . Time from publication of vulnerability to first scan seen (from 2020 
onward)23
 2024 DBIR Results and analysis42 Who would win in a fight—an email server or a file server with prep time?
43 Perhaps not in maturity, as some people assets will have their security attributes compromised to 
avoid going to therapy.
44 The DBIR authors’ pickleball team name
45 This is likely too much VERIS Standard inside baseball for the average reader, but we are amused 
very easily by things  
like this.
46 Just keep it on your file server. It should be fine, right? (Not really)Analyzing the VERIS Assets helps us 
understand where all those attacks 
we keep harping on are focused, 
and everyone sure needs help in 
prioritizing how to defend those assets. 
Even though those results might not 
be surprising as they have a good 
correlation with the VERIS Actions 
we just discussed, it is worthwhile to 
understand the year-to-year trends in 
the threat landscape.
Our asset power ranking42 has not 
changed a lot from last year, but there 
are a handful of changes that are worth 
pointing out in Figure 21. Even though 
the order from the 2023 DBIR is the 
same and the prevalence of Server 
assets is roughly the same as well, we 
find substantial growth in both Person43 
and Media assets.Person as an asset has become more 
involved this year because of the 
growth of pure Extortion action-based 
breaches in our dataset. As a social 
action, Extortion demands a Person 
as the direct victim, and the dataset 
gnomes44 are happy to oblige. What is 
interesting here is that the Ransomware 
action, where pure Extortion got its 
spin-off from, implied that there was an 
extortion phase where the money was 
requested without being connected to  
a Person asset.45
Thus, this growth in Person also 
makes sense as a more representative 
truth of the mechanics of such 
breaches. Your employees need to be 
aware of how to handle a ransom or 
extortion demand and follow whatever 
procedures were established by 
your organization to handle those. 
By the way, make sure you have 
those documented46 just in case.

Server (srv): a device that performs 
functions of some sort supporting 
the organization, commonly 
without end-user interaction. 
Where all the web applications, 
mail services, file servers and all 
that magical layer of information 
is generated. If someone has ever 
told you “the system is down,” 
rest assured that some Servers 
had their Availability impacted. 
Servers are common targets in 
almost all of the attack patterns, 
but especially in our System 
Intrusion, Basic Web Application 
Attacks, Miscellaneous Errors 
and Denial of Service patterns.
Person (per): the folks (hopefully) 
doing the work at the organization. 
No AI chat allowed. Different types 
of Persons will be members of 
different departments and will have 
associated permissions and access 
in the organization stemming from 
this role. At the very least, they 
will have access to their very own 
User device and their own hopes 
and dreams for the future. Person 
is a common target in the Social 
Engineering pattern.User device (usr): the devices 
used by Persons to perform their 
work duties in the organization. 
Usually manifested in the form of 
laptops, desktops, mobile phones 
and tablets. Common target in 
the System Intrusion pattern but 
also in the Lost and Stolen Assets 
pattern. People do like to take their 
little computers everywhere.
Network (net): not the concept 
but the actual network computing 
devices that make the bits go around 
the world, such as routers, telephone 
and broadband equipment, and some 
of the traditional in-line network 
security devices, such as firewalls 
and intrusion detection systems. Hey, 
Verizon is also a telecommunications 
company, OK?
Media (med): precious distilled data 
in its most pure and crystalline form. 
Just kidding, mostly thumb drives 
and actual printed documents. You 
will see the odd full disk drive and 
actual physical payment cards from 
time to time, but those are rare.The Media growth is intrinsically 
tied with the progression in the 
Miscellaneous Errors pattern discussed 
previously. Some of those Misdelivery 
errors happen via physical documents 
and fax machines47 which might limit 
their scope but does not make them 
any less breachworthy to regulators.
Digging deeper in Figure 22, we get 
a better sense of the Server asset 
breakdown. While the Web application 
and Mail servers are mostly involved 
Figure 22. Top Asset varieties in 
incidents (n=6,606)in credential-theft breaches, the File 
server has been almost dominated by 
the MOVEit breaches, which explains 
why more than 95% of breached 
assets are servers.
All in all, a pretty standard year in 
the VERIS Assets world. We will be 
discussing more on how to help keep 
these assets safe in the “System 
Intrusion,” “Social Engineering” and 
“Basic Web Application Attacks” 
pattern sections.25
 2024 DBIR Results and analysis49 Especially bad actions. Benevolent ones often go unnoticed.
50 Threat actors should also be sent to bed without TV if they misbehave.As we often need to remind our very 
young children and grandchildren, 
actions have consequences.49 Incidents 
and data breaches are no different,50 
and said consequences will often 
materialize as data leaks (confidentiality 
issue), unauthorized changes on your 
assets (integrity issue) or a loss of 
access to your data (availability issue).
More frequently than not, all of 
them can take a hit over the course 
of a multistep breach. Figure 23 
demonstrates how often those 
three pillars were compromised 
over time in one of our charts with 
the most “DBIR charts do not add 
up to 100% because events are 
non-exclusive” energy thus far.
Roughly a third of the incidents we 
reviewed this year were data breaches 
where the Confidentiality of data 
was compromised. Figure 24  has 
the breakdown of data varieties that 
were leaked in breaches this year, and 
Personal data is unsurprisingly at the 
top of the list.
Figure 24. Top Confidentiality data 
varieties in breaches
Figure 23. Attributes over time in incidentsThis continuous prevalence of Personal 
data in the top spot is in a way a self-
fulfilling curse because the breaches 
that get more frequently disclosed will 
be the ones involving customer data 
where regulation requires the affected 
victims to be notified. Furthermore, 
customer data is so prevalent and 
hoarded without need or proper care 
that it will often be collateral damage in 
any sort of attack that might not even 
be specifically targeting it.
Internal company data (such as emails 
and business documents) and System-
specific data also overshadow more 
exclusive targets such as Payment, 
Bank, Medical and Secrets. We have 
often described how the Ransomware 
(and now pure Extortion) breaches 
mean that the threat actors don’t 
need to care about the data they are 
stealing because they will always have 
the victim organization as the main 
buyer. We dig into ransomware, ransom 
amounts and extortion economics in 
the “System Intrusion” pattern section 
later in the report.VERIS Attributes26
People need to be assured their 
information will be kept safe so they can 
participate in society, including having 
the confidence to share their data to 
access services and use products.
Our security incident trend data, 
which we have contributed to this 
report, shows cyber threats not only 
continue to exist but increase year 
on year. It is important to remember 
that there is no single solution to 
security, but organizations can 
improve their cybersecurity through 
our guidance and tools to better 
protect people’s information.We are also encouraging organizations 
to be transparent when a cyber incident 
happens, seeking early support and 
sharing information so the cyber threat 
landscape is improved for everyone. 
The ICO will soon publish a review 
of past security incidents to help 
organizations continue to improve their

52 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkerian_HexadIn addition, we are observing a decline 
in the Credentials data type from 
a percentage point of view. This is 
because the percentage of breaches 
caused by Error actions is rising (again 
as a result of our sample) as opposed 
to external actors who are exploiting 
weak credentials though credential 
stuffing or brute force attacks.
As a final curiosity, another side 
effect of the growth of extortion non-
encrypting attacks has resulted in a 
significant bump in the Alter behavior variety under integrity. This is the 
integrity violation we get when Persons 
are influenced by external threat actors, 
and it is also a common outcome from 
a Phishing or Pretexting social action.
To see it overcome the Obscuration 
variety (the usual outcome of the 
Ransomware action) in such a 
sharp way in Figure 25 could be a 
harbinger of things to come. The 
consequence of which is that System 
Intrusion pattern attacks become 
more prevalent in the long run.Figure 25. Select Attribute varieties over time in breachesAttribute

Confidentiality (cp):  refers 
to limited observation and 
disclosure of an asset (or data). 
A loss of confidentiality implies 
that data were actually observed 
or disclosed to an unauthorized 
actor rather than endangered, 
at-risk or potentially exposed 
(the latter fall under the attribute 
of Possession or Control52). 
Short definition: limited access, 
observation and disclosure.
Integrity (ia): refers to an asset 
(or data) being complete and 
unchanged from the original or 
authorized state, content and 
function. Losses to integrity 
include unauthorized insertion, 
modification and manipulation. 
Short definition: complete and 
unchanged from original.
Availability (au): refers to an 
asset (or data) being present, 
accessible and ready for 
use when needed. Losses to 
availability include destruction, 
deletion, movement, performance 
impact (delay or acceleration) 
and interruption. Short definition:

Patterns:  
Introduction
Pareidolia is a fancy word for seeing patterns in nature—clouds that look like 
bunnies, a face in your toast looking back at you from your breakfast plate, etc. 
As we have said before in this report, the human mind looks for patterns even 
when they are not actually there.53 People simply need patterns to make sense of 
their world, and the realm of cybersecurity is no different. Several years ago, we 
realized that certain incidents appear to happen over and over again in clusters 
that share certain similar characteristics. From that realization, we devised our 
incident patterns that we have featured in our report for the last several years.These incident patterns serve to cluster 
similar incidents into categories that 
make them easier to understand and 
recall. They are based on the 4As of 
VERIS (Actor, Action, Asset, Attribute), 
which you can read more about in 
the “Results and analysis” section 
earlier in this report.54 The incident 
classification patterns, of which there 
are eight, are defined in Table 1, and

have changed over time in incidents.

We are once again featuring relevant 
ATT&CK techniques55 and Center for 
Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security 
Controls56 relevant to certain patterns.
Figure 27 illustrates how the various 
patterns have ebbed and flowed 
over the last few years in breaches. 
As you can see, System Intrusion 
continues to be the top pattern from 
a breach perspective (as opposed to 
incidents, where DoS attacks are still 
king). Both the Social Engineering and 
Miscellaneous Errors patterns have 
risen appreciably, particularly the latter, 
since last year. Conversely, the Basic 
Web Application Attacks pattern has 
fallen dramatically from its place in 
the 2023 DBIR. We get to delve into 
the reasons for these fluctuations 
further along in this section.
2024 DBIR Incident Classification PatternsBasic Web 
Application 
AttacksThese attacks are against a Web application, and after  
the initial compromise, they do not have a large number  
of additional Actions. It is the “get in, get the data and  
get out” pattern.
Denial of  
ServiceThese attacks are intended to compromise the availability  
of networks and systems. This includes both network and 
application layer attacks.
Lost and  
Stolen AssetsIncidents where an information asset went missing,  
whether through misplacement or malice, are grouped  
into this pattern.
Miscellaneous 
ErrorsIncidents where unintentional actions directly compromised  
a security attribute of an information asset fall into this 
pattern. This does not include lost devices, which are  
grouped with theft instead.
Privilege  
MisuseThese incidents are predominantly driven by unapproved  
or malicious use of legitimate privileges.
Social 
EngineeringThis attack involves the psychological compromise of a 
person that alters their behavior into taking an action or 
breaching confidentiality.
System  
IntrusionThese are complex attacks that leverage malware  
and/or hacking to achieve their objectives, including 
deploying Ransomware.
Everything  
ElseThis “pattern” isn’t really a pattern at all. Instead, it covers  
all incidents that don’t fit within the orderly confines of the 
other patterns. Like that container where you keep all the 
cables for electronics you don’t own anymore—just in case.

While shifts in tactics leveraged by 
Actors have modified some of the top 
Actions, the overall effect of these 
Actors continues to be felt by the 
majority of industries and organizations 
of all sizes. 
What is the same?
Ransomware attacks continue to drive 
the growth of this pattern as they now 
account for 23% of all breaches.System of an 
Intrusion
In the world of our attack patterns, it’s 
been a competitive year, and there have 
been a lot of contenders vying for the 
first-place prize of MFB: most frequent 
breach (granted, not as prestigious as 
the MVP, but you work with what you 
have). System Intrusion, for the third 
year in a row, leads the pack with 36% 
of breaches. Not sure exactly what 
they’re winning (our guess would be a 
good bit of cash), but we can certainly 
tell you who is losing, and that’s all of 
us. Let’s dive into what is driving the 
continued success of this pattern.

The makeup of this pattern hasn’t 
changed much. It is where our more 
sophisticated attacks57 are found. They 
still largely consist of breaches and 
incidents in which the threat actor 
leverages a combination of Hacking 
techniques and Malware to penetrate 
the victim organization—more or less 
what one might expect from an 
unauthorized penetration test. However, 
rather than providing a helpful written 
report at the conclusion of the exercise, 
they typically deploy Ransomware and 
provide the victim with a much less 
helpful extortion note. These 
Ransomware attacks account for 70% 
of the incidents within System Intrusion, 
as seen in Figure 28. The other often 
seen actions in the System Intrusion 
pattern tend to be those that provide 
the actor access to the environment, 
such as Exploit vulnerabilities and 
Backdoors. We also saw Extortion 
creeping into this space, primarily  
due to a large and impactful event  
that we will discuss later in the report—
so stay tuned.58Ransomhow?
With regard to vectors (Figure 29), we 
saw a great deal of Direct install. This 
is when threat actors use their existing 
system access to install malware, 
such as Ransomware or Backdoors. 
The vector of Web applications, which 
is a favored target of exploits, also 
appeared frequently, as we discussed in 
the ways-in analysis in the “Results and 
analysis” section. Of course, we still see 
threat actors leveraging Email to reach 
users and Desktop sharing software 
to gain entry into systems. Because 
these threat actors use a plethora of 
tools and techniques, this data is longer 
tailed, which is why Other shows up 
relatively often in our top five. Within the 
category of Other are vectors such as 
VPNs, Software updates and a whole 
bunch of Unknowns (our bet is that it 
is most likely split among the tactics 
discussed above, just not explicitly 
reported to us). Therefore, when 
prioritizing your efforts at protecting 
yourself, don’t neglect addressing 
malware infections, stolen credentials 
or unpatched systems as it may lead 
you to break out in Ransomware.59
Ransomwho?
Much like Sisyphus with his never-
ending task, it seems that the 
hardworking people in IT must continue 
to contend with the evolving threat of 
Ransomware. Ransomware has again 
dominated the charts, accounting 
for 11% of all incidents, making it 
the second most common incident 
type. Ransomware (or some type of 
Extortion) appears in 92% of industries 
as one of the top threats.
2024 DBIR Incident Classification PatternsFigure 28 . Top Action varieties in 
System Intrusion incidentsWhen we remove the Ransomware 
groups from this dataset,60 we’re left 
with a pretty even split of 44% run-of-
the-mill types of criminals and 40% 
State-affiliated actors. It shouldn’t 
be too surprising to find out that the 
tactics used by criminals are very 
closely aligned to those used by Actors 
working on the behalf of their country.Figure 29 . Top Action vectors in 
System Intrusion incidents (n=1,789)
57 If these attacks were people, they would drink fine wine in restaurants, pontificate loudly on  
the vintage and drive cars made in Scandinavia. 
58 And if you could hit the Like and Subscribe buttons, we’d appreciate it. Oh, wait, wrong platform.
59 And a visit to the dermatologist won’t help.
60 Ah, wouldn’t that be nice? Just the thought of it improved my mood.Ransomware (or some type  
of Extortion) appears in 92%

top threats.32

63 Note that the source of this data is from ransomware negotiators, which might be a self-selecting 
sample. Those who can afford to employ a negotiator in this kind of incident may also be targeted 
with higher ransom demands since they are likely to be higher revenue organizations.demand percentage. There were a few 
within the top 10% of cases reaching 
up to 24% of total revenue. Hopefully 
these ranges assist organizations 
in running risk scenarios with an 
eye toward potential direct costs 
associated with a ransomware attack. 
Of course, there are many other factors 
that should also be considered, but this 
is a good starting point.Clearly, the major difference is what 
they do with that access. The subset 
of criminals in this pattern who aren’t 
doing Ransomware/Extortion are 
quietly siphoning off Payment data 
from e-commerce sites and account 
for 57% of breaches involving 
stolen Payment cards, while the 
State-affiliated actors look to pivot 
and steal other types of data.61
Ransomwhat?
Understanding the cost associated with 
Ransomware is a bit complex as there 
are several primary and secondary 
costs to consider, not to mention the 
possible soft costs associated with 
reputational impacts. While we try our 
best to capture these costs, it’s worth 
noting that the result isn’t a full picture 
but simply our best approximation using 
the data we have.
One of the easier costs to capture is 
the amount associated with paying 
the actual ransom. Analyzing the FBI 
IC362 dataset this year, we found that 
the median adjusted loss (after law 
enforcement worked to try to recover 
funds) for those who did pay was 
around $46,000 as shown in Figure 30. 
This is a significant increase from the 
previous year’s median of $26,000, but 
you should also take into consideration 
that only 4% of the complaints had any 
actual loss this time, as opposed to 7% 
last year.
Another way we can slice the data is 
by looking at ransom demands as a 
percentage of the total revenue.63 The 
median amount of the initial ransom 
demand was 1.34% of the victim 
organization’s total revenue—with 50% 
of the demands being between 0.13% 
and 8.30% (Figure 31). We know this 
is quite a spread for the initial ransom 33

2024 DBIR Incident Classification Patternsspeculation. What it did accomplish, 
however, was to slightly confound 
the differences that exist between 
the System Intrusion and Social 
Engineering patterns by introducing 
a big chunk of data that neatly fits 
in both categories. After it stole 
the data, Cl0p used Extortion as a 
means of separating the victims from 
their hard-earned money.MOVEit or don’t.
Over the summer, we were teased 
with the idea of a great crossover, 
one involving the father of the 
atomic bomb and a plastic doll. 
For this year’s report, we have 
a similar type of crossover but 
perhaps a bit less entertaining. In 
the hope of continuing to increase 
their shareholders’ affiliates’ 
profits, ransomware groups have 
demonstrated a remarkable ability to 
evolve their tactics.
One such recent evolution was 
snapshotted in the MOVEit incident, 
where threat actors64 used a zero-
day attack (a previously unknown 
and unpatched vulnerability) in file 
management software and went 
on a spree appropriating whoever’s 
data they could get their hands on 
and holding it hostage. While the 
attack affected organizations from a 
variety of sectors, Education was by 
far the largest impacted (Figure 32), 
accounting for more than 50% of the 
breached organizations, according 
to our breach notification dataset.While this seems like pretty 
standard e-criminal stuff, it was a 
shift in tactics worth discussing. 
For starters, the group didn’t 
actually deploy Ransomware in 
all of these cases, even though 
it was previously partial to that 
tactic. There could have been 
myriad reasons as to why the group 
didn’t choose this option, and 
anything we’d suggest would be

(n=1,567)

 2024 DBIR Incident Classification Patterns65 And pop culture references
66 Even though, as 2024 begins, the focus seems to be on VPN and remote Desktop sharing software.When we look at Ransomware 
breaches over time (Figure 33), we 
notice a dip in the cases; however, 
when we combine it with Extortion, 
we see that it follows pretty much 
the same trend line. This indicates 
to us that it may be the same actors, 
and they are simply shifting tactics 
to best leverage the type of access 
they have. This combination did 
show a significant growth as a part 
of breaches, as we touched on in the 
second entry of our “Summary of 
findings” section.
The DBIR team looks at numbers,65 
not code, so this report isn’t the best 
place to explain all the technical 
elements. Nevertheless, what the 
vulnerability essentially did was 
to allow the attackers to upload 
a backdoor through a crafty SQL 
injection attack. This backdoor 
allowed the attackers to perform 
several different tasks such as 
downloading data and manipulating 
the application’s legitimate users.Unfortunately, because of the nature 
of the platform, file transfer systems 
need to be on the internet, and 
the fact that this was an unknown 
vulnerability at the time of exploit 
ensured that there was nothing 
victims could have done to prevent 
it. There can be no doubt that this 
was a large-scale and impactful 
attack; however, it wasn’t without 
precedent. In fact, just a few months 
before, in January 2023, the same 
group had targeted another file 
hosting platform resulting in a rather 
busy month for Ransomware claims.As we gaze into our crystal ball, we 
wouldn’t be surprised if we continue 
to see zero-day vulnerabilities being 
widely leveraged by ransomware 
groups. If their preference for file 
transfer platforms continues,66 
this should serve as a caution 
for those vendors to check their 
code very closely for common 
vulnerabilities. Likewise, if your 
organization utilizes these kinds of 
platforms—or anything exposed to 
the internet, for that matter—keep 
a very close eye on the security 
patches those vendors release 
and prioritize their application.Figure 33. Ransomware and Extortion breaches over time

Pretexting continues to be the leading 
cause of cybersecurity incidents, with 
actors targeting users with existing 
email chains and context. Extortion 
also grew dramatically because of 
the large-scale MOVEit incident.
What is the same?
Phishing and Pretexting via 
email continue to be the leading 
cause of incidents in this sector, 
accounting for 73% of breaches.37
Figure 35. Top Action vectors in Social 
Engineering breaches (n=2,961)*ishing in  
the wind
In the cybersecurity world, or “the 
cyber biz,” as we call it, we certainly 
love our catchy terminology. Terms 
such as whaling, smishing, quishing, 
tishing, vishing, wishing, pharming, 
snowshoeing67 and plain old phishing 
are ever-present in the Social 
Engineering pattern. This makes sense 
because there are a lot of vectors 
on which we need to educate our 
employees and end users, and we’re 
positive that in another five years, there 
will be new ones that we will have to 
add to our list.
However, even with the growth of these 
new vectors and types of attacks, we 
tend to see the core social tactics such 
as Pretexting and Phishing still being 
used often (Figure 34). More than 40% 
of incidents involved Pretexting, and 
31% involved Phishing. Other tried-and-
true tactics such as attacks coming in 
via email, text and websites (Figure 35) 
aren’t necessarily the most exciting, 
but any security professionals who 
have been around for any length of time 
have probably seen these contenders 
in some capacity over their careers. Regardless of the exact method that 
attackers use to reach organizations, 
the core tactic is the same: They seek 
to exploit our human nature and our 
willingness to trust and be helpful for 
their own gain. While these attacks 
all share that commonality, one rather 
significant difference is the scale and 
pervasiveness of these tactics.
First, the good news. We have not seen 
a dramatic rise in Pretexting like we 
did last year. However, it is also true 
that it hasn’t decreased but instead 
has maintained its position as the top 
type of Social Engineering incident. As 
a quick reminder, when we talk about 
Pretexting, largely consider this as 
a stand-in for BEC, where attackers 
leverage existing email chains to 
convince victims to do something, such 
as update an associated bank account 
with a deposit.

Figure 36 . Median transaction size for BECsLow tech,  
high cost
Unfortunately, the bad news comes 
next, which is that BECs continue to 
have a substantial financial impact on 
organizations. Figure 36 captures the 
growth in terms of costs associated 
with BEC since early 2018. As we 
mentioned above, there isn’t any growth 
this year as compared to last year, but 
neither has it decreased,  
with the median transaction hovering 
around $50,000.
One of the best things you can do 
when you realize you are a victim of 
BEC fraud is to promptly work with 
law enforcement. Figure 37 shows the 
distributions of outcomes from the 
cases our data contributors at the FBI 
IC368 have worked. In half of the cases, 
they were able to recoup 79% or more 
of the losses. On the less fortunate 
side, 18% of the incidents had nothing 
frozen and potentially lost everything 
that was sent to the criminals.

I hope this 
threat finds 
you well.
Our introvert selves were already 
weary of all these social “interactions” 
even before these extortion-based 
attacks from ransomware groups 
busted through the door into the Social 
Engineering pattern. Social attacks, 
such as those involving Phishing, have 
long played their part in ushering in a 
ransomware deployment, as typified 
by the leveraging of those techniques 
in the ALPHV breach of MGM Resorts 
and other entertainment groups. But 
given the shift in tactics by some 
groups, along with the Extortion action 
being the final result of the breach as 
opposed to an initial one, this seemingly 
“System intrusion-y” attack now also 
shows up in this pattern.
Keep in mind, however, that Extortion 
isn’t anything new in this pattern. We’ve 
seen various iterations of it from the 
empty threats (“We’ve hacked your 
phone and caught you doing NSFW 
stuff.”) to somewhat credible threats 
(“Look us up. We’re super-duper 
hackers that’ll DDoS you.”) to very 
credible threats (“We’ll leak the data 
we took. Here are samples for you to 
validate.”). This year, however, Extortion 
showed up in spades as a result of 
the MOVEit breach, which affected 
organizations on a relatively large scale 
and in an extremely public fashion. 
2024 DBIR Incident Classification PatternsThis is plainly visible in the steps to 
breaches chart (Figure 38). As you can 
see, there has been a dramatic increase 
in compromising servers via Hacking. 
Given the prevalence of these types of 
attacks, we recommend discussions 
with leadership to determine what 
the course of action should be if 
they occur in your organization. 
Figure 38 . Steps in Social Engineering incidents40
 2024 DBIR Incident Classification PatternsSchool of 
phishes
This is probably cliché at this point, 
but we’re believers that the first line 
of defense for any organization isn’t 
the castrametation69 of their systems 
but the education of their key staff, 
including end users.70 Fortunately, 
this isn’t simply us standing on our 
“user-awareness” soapbox. We have 
both figures and hard numbers to 
help quantify our stance. The first 
lesson to learn is that Phishing attacks 
happen fast. The median time to click 
on a malicious link after the email is 
opened is 21 seconds, and then it 
takes only another 28 seconds to 
enter the data (Figure 39). That leads 
to a frightening finding: The median 
time for users to fall for phishing 
emails is less than 60 seconds. 
Some good news is that, as an industry, 
we seem to be getting better with 
regard to phishing test reporting. 
More than 20% of users identified and 
reported phishing per engagement, 
including 11% of the users who did click 
the email. As Figure 40 illustrates, this 
is another impressive improvement and 
one that we desperately need in order 
to catch up with the previous year’s 
increases in Phishing and Pretexting. Figure 40. Phishing email report rate by click statusFigure 40. Phishing email report rate by click status
That leads to a frightening 
finding: The median time for 
users to fall for phishing emails 
is less than 60 seconds. 
69 There is a very obvious Maginot Line joke to be made here, so we will leave it as an exercise for 
the readers.
70 Perhaps we should say, “especially end users.”Figure 39. Time between email clicked and data entered

associated with this pattern, many of 
the controls pertain to helping users 
detect and report attacks as well as 
protecting their user accounts in the 
event that they fall victim to a phishing

Figure 42 . Top Action varieties since 
2013 (n=35,970)What if we were to tell you there is 
perhaps no pattern that is as complex, 
multifaceted and, quite frankly, riveting 
to read about as the Basic Web 
Application Attacks pattern? We’d 
be pulling your leg, that’s what. This 
pattern is basically just like it sounds: 
typically uncomplicated attacks against 
either unprotected or (more often) 
poorly protected web applications 
that grant the criminal a foothold 
into an organization’s environment. If 
the System Intrusion pattern can be 
thought of as a sophisticated bank71 
heist,72 this pattern presents us with 
a good visualization of Occam’s razor 
in action. It has fewer steps and is 
possibly the simplest and shortest 
path from point A to point B. Like many 
things that are not overly complicated, it 
works extremely well.
Last year, this type of attack accounted 
for one-quarter of all breaches. This 
year, however, our dataset shows 
just over 8% of breaches in the Basic 
Web Application Attacks pattern. As 
is always the case in this pattern, the 
attacker gains access via hacking by 
the Use of stolen credentials (77%), 
Brute force (usually easily guessable 
passwords) (21%) or the Exploit vuln 
action (13%) (Figure 41).
Beware devs 
bearing crypto.
Interestingly, approximately 20% of 
the malware in this pattern consists of 
cryptocurrency mining Malware. Upon 
further inspection, we found a small 
cluster of Nation-state actors that 
were leveraging known vulnerabilities 
and cryptocurrency mining malware 
(and Ransomware) to make a few extra 
dollars for their country. Not something 
particularly revolutionary but always 
interesting to see tactics that are more 
than a decade old still hold up.Like a one-size-fits-all gas station 
baseball cap (“Keep on Truckin’ ”),  
any organization can fit into the Basic 
Web Application Attacks pattern, 
but it won’t look too good on you. 
The Financial and Insurance (18%); 
Information (14%); and Professional, 
Scientific and Technical Services 
(13%) industries make up the top 
three verticals affected by Basic Web 
Application Attacks, but we see these 
attacks in most other industries as well. 
There is also no substantial difference 
between large organizations (55%) and 
small organizations (47%) in the Basic 
Web Application Attacks pattern.
71 For more bank heist content, please review the Financial vertical in the “Industries” section.
72 We probably shouldn’t mention movies such as “Ocean’s Eleven” or “The Great Train Robbery”  
or we may need to pay royalties.
73 And we hope you are.
74 Or will it just continue to spice up our daily lives with mystery?Attack of 
the stolen 
credentials
If you’re a regular reader,73 you may 
have realized by now that there are a 
great many incidents in our dataset 
that leverage stolen credentials. Over 
the past 10 years, stolen credentials 
have appeared in almost one-third 
(31%) of breaches (Figure 42). Ergo, 
credentials are a core component of 
compromising organizations. However, 
while we know this to be a fact, there 
are a lot of things we don’t know about 
these credentials: Where do they 
come from, how did they get here and 
will we ever know the full story?74
2024 DBIR Incident Classification PatternsFigure 41 . Top Hacking actions in Basic 
Web Application Attacks breaches 
(n=713)44
If we are to understand where 
stolen credentials come from, we 
must consider the different types 
of credential attacks that exist. 
Unsurprisingly, Phishing is the most 
common credential-related attack 
that we see in our dataset and 
accounts for 14% of breaches involving 
Credentials. Social Engineering is 
extremely common and remarkably 
effective because it targets individuals 
versus systems. It’s much easier to 
harden a system than it is to harden an 
individual,75 as our Social Engineering 
section illustrated. Another basic type 
of credential attack is Brute force 
(guessing all the passwords), and while 
it is an effective tool in the attacker’s 
arsenal, it appears in only 2% of 
breaches this year. This technique is 
most successful when individuals or 
applications use weak or, even worse, 
default credentials. A silver lining here is 
that Brute force attacks have existed as 
long as there has been a login option, so 
a multitude of mitigations are commonly 
available, such as enforcing password 
complexity (ick) and length (slightly less 
ick) as well as limiting how quickly and 
how often logins can be attempted.No country for 
old credentials
Credential stuffing is Brute force’s more 
hip cousin.76 While these attacks have 
a lot in common, credential stuffing 
affords the attacker a greater chance 
of success. That’s because rather than 
guessing all possible combinations, 
credential stuffing leverages 
combinations of usernames/emails and 
passwords that are already known to 
exist because they were harvested from 
previous breaches. Recent high-profile 
cases have occurred in which attackers 
leveraged this technique to gain access 
to highly personal user data.
These types of attacks are more 
insidious because they spread the 
attack across various accounts and 
IP addresses, thus making them 
more difficult to prevent. If your 
organization has a high number of 
customers, especially consumer-facing 
web applications and application 
programming interfaces (APIs), you 
should consider instituting robust 
protections before attackers use a tool 
and a free list of proxies to attempt 
combinations they found in a chat site.
75 The former becomes more secure, while the latter simply becomes jaded.
76 Aviator sunglasses are involved.
77 Not unlike Bigfoot (No DBIR would be complete without at least one Sasquatch reference.)
2024 DBIR Incident Classification PatternsSpeaking of APIs, we can examine the 
prevalence of those types of attacks 
in sampled detection data from our 
API firewall data partners in Figure 43. 
As expected, credential stuffing is 
the most commonly identified attack, 
but it is often commingled with Brute 
force. Another interesting result from 
this dataset was that the prevalence of 
credential abuse-like attacks amounted 
to only 15% of attacks, less than 
half of what we see in Use of stolen 
credentials in the incident dataset. This 
makes sense because there is much 
more to try to exploit on APIs than just 
credentials.
But what if you don’t have consumer 
facing web applications or APIs? What 
if you already enforce strict password 
policies, such as a monthly rotation 
of 24-character passwords? Surely 
such a fate could not befall you, right? 
Unfortunately, password stealers 
can still snatch your data. While we 
admittedly do not see password 
dumpers too often in our dataset (2% 
of breaches), it is important to keep in 
mind that we can only report on those 
things into which we have visibility, and 
this type of Malware likes to reside in 
places where there’s limited visibility77 
(such as personal computers, not work-
related ones).
To get an idea of how pervasive this 
issue might be, we took a look at the 
marketplaces dedicated to selling 
and reselling credentials and cookies 
collected from these password 
stealers. Our sample was only two days 
from one market; nevertheless, we 
found more than a thousand credentials 
per day being posted for sale with an 
average price of $10.
Figure 43. Distribution of web application attack types45
After examining these postings, we 
found that 65% of these credentials 
were posted for sale less than one 
day from when they were collected.78 
They are often purchased by attackers 
who leverage them as a beachhead for 
other attacks, against either individuals 
or their employers. Oftentimes these 
product offerings not only list what 
credentials or cookies are available 
but also give information regarding 
the associated region. We wanted to 
determine whether these credentials 
are coming from organizationally 
managed assets or personal 
computers. On average, more than 
30% of postings had no social media 
credentials listed, which could be an 
indication that many of the systems 
aren’t for personal use. Figure 44 
shows the percentage of postings 
by stealer family name without social 
media accounts listed. 
Another source of password stealers 
are libraries posted on public 
repositories. For the non-developers 
of the world, writing code is incredibly 
tedious, and our “if it’s not easy, I’m 
not doing it” society has led to people 
creating libraries that other developers 
can import simply by saying “pip 
install library-of-my-choice” or “install.
packages (‘library-of-my-choice’)”79 
and download the library they find 
posted. Needless to say, a very real 
risk with this approach is that you’re 
taking it on faith that the libraries you’re 
downloading are free from malware. 
Human nature being what it is, that is 
often not the case, and the libraries 
act as a means of distributing malware. 
Fortunately, there are numerous 
companies that actively scan the 
uploaded libraries to identify possible 
malware. When malicious packages are 
found, they often consist of information 
stealers (shocker).Of course, simply uploading a package 
is not enough, it still requires someone 
to download it.80 Figure 45 captures 
some of the more popular approaches 
found in an npm repository.81 The 
most common type we found in the 
JavaScript ecosystems were malicious 
packages that would advertise 
themselves as free video game 
currency generators. These target the 
folks who are clever enough to know 
how to install and download the code 
but not sufficiently clever to realize 
that if it sounds too good to be true, it 
usually is.82In addition, there were malicious 
packages that leveraged typosquatting. 
This is when the developer of the 
malware posts the package with a 
similar name as a popular package 
in the hopes that someone would 
accidentally mistype the package name 
when attempting to install the legitimate 
package. As a group of authors who 
collectively would be unemployed if 
it were not for the existence of spell-
check, we can see this being a relatively 
effective tactic.

targeted what we (and a few people

dependency confusion attacks. In these 
types of attacks, the attackers take 
advantage of how some tooling checks 
for packages on public repositories 
before it checks for private ones. If the 
attackers know that organizations are 
using the library “super-cool-internal-
library,” which is stored in their internal 
repository, the attackers can create 
a library on a public repository called 
“super-cool-internal-library” and the 
tooling may check the public repo 
first before looking at the internal 
ones. Fortunately, there are various 
programming best practices that can 
help mitigate this, alongside all the

Miscellaneous 
Errors
I know exactly 
what I’m doing.
In our fast-paced and hectic world, it is 
easy to make the occasional mistake. 
The key is to make sure that those 
errors remain occasional and do not 
become habitual. Employees might be 
inching toward the latter state given 
the fact that we saw approximately five 
times as many Error-related breaches 
this year as we did in last year’s report. 
Does this substantial increase mean 
that incompetence and inattention to 
detail are booming?84 Possibly, but it 
is also, as stated earlier in this report, 
indicative of the generosity of our 
data-sharing partners. The greater the 
number of breaches that we examine, 
the higher these percentages become. 
More than 50% of errors in 2023 
resulted from Misdelivery (sending 
something to the wrong recipient), as 
shown in Figure 46. This was also the 
No. 1 category in last year’s report.
Misconfiguration is the next most 
common error and was seen in 
approximately 10% of breaches. 
Misconfiguration has been on a 
downward trend85 for the last three 
years. There are a few possible 
explanations for this. Chief among 
them is that (thankfully) many systems 
are becoming more secure by default, 
making the practice of standing up 
new tech without reading the manual 
a less risky proposal. Other factors 
may include that security researchers 
are not spending as much time on 
finding these systems with their screen 
doors flapping in the wind, and, lastly, Frequency 2,679 incidents,

Errors have increased substantially 
this year, possibly indicating a rise in 
Carelessness, although it may also 
reflect increased data visibility with 
new contributors. More than 50% of 
errors were the result of Misdelivery, 
continuing last year’s trend, while other 
errors, such as Disposal, are declining. 
End-users now account for 87% of 
errors, emphasizing the need for 
universal error-catching controls  
across industries.
What is the same?
We can always count on people making 
mistakes. The categories of mistakes 
they make are consistent year over 
year, and while some Error varieties 
have been decreasing, the ranking of 
frequency remains the same.

84 Look around at your coworkers, and use your best judgment to answer that question.
85 Not unlike most of civilization 48
criminals may be using the same tools 
historically utilized by researchers to 
discover these errors and exploiting 
them to steal data, which would 
result in the attack showing up with 
a Hacking action rather than Error.
Classification errors, Publishing 
errors and Gaffes (verbal slips) are 
all relatively tightly packed in order of 
mention. Disposal errors continue to 
decline ever so slightly (as has been 
the general trend for the last several 
years) and accounted for just over 
1% of the cases in this pattern. It is 
unclear whether more attention has 
been paid to this matter or employees 
have simply gotten better at burning 
records in a barrel in the parking lot.
Figure 47 shows one rather drastic 
change in this pattern related to actors: 
End-user accounted for 87% of errors 
as opposed to 20% in last year’s report, 
while System administrators dropped 
to only 11% (from 46% last year). This 
drop is in large part the result of the 
corresponding rise in Misdelivery—
it takes a System administrator to 
misconfigure, but any old End-user 
can misdeliver. Power to the people!CIS

Denial of 
Service
Another year, another victory lap 
to our running champion, Denial 
of Service. Figure 49 shows this 
pattern being responsible for more 
than 50% of incidents analyzed this 
year.86 This pattern has been the 
most prevalent one for several years 
now, and you don’t have to think very 
hard to understand why: Denial of 
Service attacks are relatively cheap 
to execute, and it is actually fairly 
easy for them to be successful,87 at 
least until an organization’s defenses 
are activated to mitigate them.Frequency 16,843 incidents,  
3 with confirmed data

Threat actors External (100%)  
(all incidents)Summary
Denial of Service attacks can target 
different points of infrastructure and will 
manifest themselves in several forms 
that organizations need to be prepared 
to handle.
What is the same?
Denial of Service attacks continue  
to be ubiquitous and the top pattern  
for incidents.
86 No electric toothbrushes were harmed during this observed growth of the Denial of Service pattern.
87 To some degree of negligible success
88 Or as we like to call it, “the statistical worst-case scenario that is not that weird outlier messing up your data analysis.”
2024 DBIR Incident Classification PatternsFigure 49 . Patterns in incidents 
(n=30,458)Our ongoing analysis of content 
delivery network (CDN)-monitored, web 
application-focused Denial of Service 
attacks shows that even though the 
median attack size has reduced slightly 
from 2.2 gigabits per second (Gbps) 
to 1.6 Gbps, the 97.5th percentile of 
those attacks88 increased to 170 Gbps 
from the previous high of 124 Gbps. 
Figure 50 showcases the data and 
the other percentile break points like 
the more realistic and grounded 90th 
percentiles. Those types of attacks 
are usually short duration, with large 
volumes—50% of those attacks 
are less than five minutes long.
However, this year, we would like 
to try something different: Those 
precision-targeted attacks are very 
high volume. It is interesting to see 
the contrast to the impact of general 
distributed DoS (DDoS) filtering on 
the ISP level, where it is necessary to 
mitigate against a much wider variety 
of attacks and is prone to collateral 
damage from the high-volume ones.

Figures 51 and 52 represent the 
distribution of both bits per second 
and packets per second distribution of 
ISP-level collateral attacks all over the 
world.89 This dataset includes attacks 
on ISPs themselves; enterprises 
that paid for DDoS protection from 
their ISPs; and even individual users 
with broadband, mobile, wireless or 
satellite.90 It’s clear that these are much 
smaller in size because the volume for 
this diverse group would not need to be 
as big as for enterprises. Those are also 
longer duration attacks, with the median 
attack time being around nine minutes.91 
All in all, this class of Denial of Service 
attacks might be more representative 
of the challenges a non-e-commerce 
or heavily extranet service-oriented 
organization might face.
Additionally, our subject matter experts 
(SMEs) continue to report the growth of 
low-volume, persistent attacks on high-
interaction services such as Domain 
Name System (DNS). When you want to 
take someone off the internet, there is 
more than one way to peel a potato.92
At the end of the day, our 
recommendation remains the same 
as in the previous years. There is 
relatively minimal setup necessary 
for a DoS attack to take place, 
so organizations should consider 
having some sort of automated or 
semi-automated protection system 
to help mitigate those. There is 
not a lot more to be done than to 
be prepared for the eventuality of 
some threat actor wanting to sever 
you from the internet for a while. To 
think otherwise is to live in denial.

This year we saw an increase in the

confirmed data breaches in this pattern.
What is the same?
Devices are still much more likely to be 
lost than stolen. Laptops continue to be 
a risk for loss in particular.Now where did 
I put that?
If you’ve ever been through the line

of anxiety you were feeling to avoid

experience. It is little wonder items 
go missing while people are away 
from their usual environment and 
potentially distracted. Despite having 
wonderful data storage capabilities 
and an ever-smaller size, User Devices 
are the most likely to go missing—
whether by ill will or inattention. Chief 
among them is the ubiquitous laptop, 
and we’ve seen an increase of those 
events this year after a brief downturn 
in 2022, as shown in Figure 53.

2024 DBIR Incident Classification PatternsAs we have seen consistently in our 
dataset, assets are vastly more likely 
to be lost than stolen. Figure 54 shows 
that this was not always the case. 
Until 2021, we saw more items stolen, 
but perhaps given the pandemic’s 
lessening of people out mingling, the 
theft opportunities were reduced. That 
said, we still see this trend despite 
most companies returning to a more 
traditional in-person work environment, 
so there could be something else at 
play here.This year we saw a higher percentage 
of incidents involving Assets in this 
pattern causing confirmed data 
breaches as well, with last year showing 
about 8% confirmed breaches and 
this year showing a surprising 91%. 
The important thing is to have 
protections on assets, where 
possible, that can stop a lost or 
stolen device from becoming a 
reportable data breach. Given the 
prevalence of this pattern, it seems 
that someone lost that memo.Figure 54. Top Action varieties over time in Lost and Stolen Assets53

Employee betrayal poses a significant 
threat because employees steal 
data for personal benefit, sometimes 
colluding with External actors. Personal 
data is the prime target, along with 
Internal information. While we saw 
a spike in Fraudulent transactions 
last year, that has once again leveled 
out and is a lesser concern.
What is the same?
Internal actors are again largely 
working on their own in this pattern. 
The Financial motivation remains 
in ascension, while Espionage is 
a distant second. Personal data is 
still the main targeted data type.Fool me once.
Companies trust their employees. They 
trust them to do their jobs, raise issues 
that need attention and generally have 
the organization’s best interests at 
heart. And in a perfect world, everyone 
would go along with this plan. But in 
this pattern, we see that is not always 
the case. Sometimes employees are in 
it for their own benefit at the expense 
of the company.93 Sometimes the 
relationship just isn’t working out, and 
the employee feels entitled to the data 
that would make their landing at their 
next employer so much more attractive. 
As a consequence of actions such as 
these, we can provide the data breach 
analysis found in this pattern.94 Nobody 
wants to believe their employees will 
do them dirty, but if it happens, do you 
know how your organization would 
detect it? If you don’t, you’re not alone, 
and it may have already happened.
Shame on you.
What motivates employees to steal 
data? In our experience, it is largely 
Financial. Whether they plan to use 
the data to commit financial crimes 
or just help them get a leg up in a 
new gig, it tends to be for their own 
direct benefit. We do also see the 
Espionage motive where employees 
take their ill-gotten gains to a direct 
competitor or even use them to start

94 So it’s not all bad news, right?54
 2024 DBIR Incident Classification PatternsFigure 55. Top Confidentiality data varieties over time in Privilege Misuse breachesIn our prior report, we saw collusion—
multiple actors working in concert to 
achieve the goal of the breach—at 7%, 
which, while nowhere near the highs we 
saw back in 2019, was still a surprise. 
This year, things seem to have gone 
back to normal, and we are seeing 
collusion dropping to less than 1% of 
breaches. This is good news because 
it’s bad enough when employees start 
making off with company data, but 
when they team up with outsiders, 
chaos ensues.
As Figure 55 shows, employees are 
largely taking Personal data—this is 
likely about customers, since names, 
contact info and other such things 
could be quite useful for both starting 
a new competing enterprise or for 
committing financial crimes. We saw 
Internal data show a bit of a spike 
this year as well, which would include 
sensitive plans and intellectual property 
that would attract the Espionage-
motivated employee. Finally, Banking 
data is remaining mostly steady over 
time as a targeted data type.Last year we observed a sharp uptick 
in the Fraudulent transaction, so we 
wanted to take a look this year to 
determine whether it was the start of a 
trend. This is commonly the end game 
of the BEC attack—where attackers 
socially engineer someone into sending 
them cash electronically. Internal 
actors already have access to systems 
containing that capability, and they 
made good use of it last year. We are 
happy to report that this trend has not 
continued. Despite spiking to almost 
15% in last year’s data, it has returned 
to a placid 3% this year.CIS

 2024 DBIR IndustriesIndustries: 
Introduction
Greetings! If you are just stepping onto the DBIR scene, please consider this your 
orientation. For our more seasoned veterans, feel free to simply breeze past—this 
terrain should be familiar ground.
As mentioned previously, in this report we examined 30,458 incidents, of which 
10,626 were confirmed data breaches. We will view both of these categories in a 
more granular fashion, along with how they played out in the various industries and 
regions, in the following sections of the report. As we have mentioned in previous 
editions, what keeps one industry tossing and turning at night may not even register 
as a blip on another’s radar. It boils down to attack surfaces—the prime real estate 
for cyber malfeasance. When you factor in the nuances of specific types of threat 
actors, the technological infrastructures underpinning each sector, the type of data 
an organization handles and retains, and how folks access and use that data, you’ve 
mixed a potent cocktail of security complexities.
For example, consider a tech behemoth swimming in the digital sea of mobile 
devices and their respective apps. Its risk profile looks markedly different from 
that of a boutique establishment relying on a point-of-sale system or a simple 
e-commerce platform supported by its vendor. Furthermore, these findings are also 
influenced by reporting requirements, which means that industries may experience 
varying levels of scrutiny from that perspective. Finally, smaller sample sizes for 
given industries are also an important factor that comes into play with regard to 
statistical analysis (smaller sample sizes result in lessened statistical confidence). 
Therefore, we ask readers to refrain from rushing to conclusions about an industry’s 
security posture based solely on incident reports.
If you are here for insights tailored to your industry, we recommend that you spend 
time looking at the top patterns for your industry and reading up on the relevant 
pattern sections of the report. Just to let you know, the DBIR aligns with the North 
American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to determine which industry an 
organization belongs to. More detail on this can be found in Appendix A.57

There is always something cozy and 
comforting about the local coffee 
shop you call your second home, and 
attackers couldn’t agree more. The 
Accommodation and Food Services 
industry continues to face the same 
core threats as before with System 
Intrusion, Social Engineering and Basic 
Web Application Attacks leading the 
pack. As is visible in Figure 58, there’s 
been a notable increase in social 
engineering attacks from last year. 
This is largely a result of the increase 
in Pretexting, which has more than 
doubled over the last year and now 
accounts for 20% of the incidents.Accommodation and

As if accidentally handing over your 
hard-earned money to criminals wasn’t 
annoying enough, organizations in this 
sector also have to contend with the 
rudest guests possible—ransomware 
actors. Ransomware continues to be 
one of the top action varieties and 
has been for the last three years. 
However, the only good news is that 
it hasn’t increased this year and 
holds steady at 16% of all incidents.
In other news, Payment card data 
being compromised has dropped to an 
all-time low, from 41% of breaches in 
2023 to now only 19%. This decrease 
aligns well with the overall decrease of 
Payment card data being targeted that 
we’ve seen across various industries, 
which may be indicating that shifts 
in chip technology might be causing 
threat actors to focus their efforts on 
other approaches. A nice bit of good 
news to enjoy with your cappuccino.

Summary
Errors of various types committed 
by internal actors and Extortion 
from external threat actors 
continue to constitute the 
curriculum of this industry.Educational 
Services
Learn from 
your mistakes.
The Educational Services industry has 
a great deal to be proud of. It played a 
significant role in what was ultimately 
the creation of the internet, it created 
the textbook industry that we all know 
and love, and, of course, arguably its 
crowning achievement: recess. In spite 
of all this success, however, it is not 
without problems. But before we get 
into the Advanced Placement-level 
breach findings, let’s cover the more 
remedial Error section. Figure 59 
shows that the Miscellaneous Errors 
pattern has been trending upward for 
the last two years in the Educational 
Services vertical. Not unlike the 
other industries that we examine, 
Misdelivery is front and center, 
accounting for 56% of errors. Loss 
(19%) and Classification error (10%) 
round off the top three error varieties.
NAICS

2024 DBIR IndustriesI feel so 
exploited.
Now that we have Errors out of the 
way, let’s talk about the real area 
of concern for this vertical. The 
action types of malware (Backdoor 
– 57%), hacking (Exploit vuln – 56%) 
and social (Extortion – 50%) were 
present in almost the exact same 
percentages. This, of course, indicates 
that MOVEit—the well-known file 
transfer software that, when exploited, 
caused so much trouble for so many 
over the last year—was definitely 
enrolled in the Educational Services 
industry. As readers may recall, 
Ransomware was prevalent in this 
industry in last year’s report and the 
end game of Ransomware is Extortion. 
The campaign that leveraged the 
MOVEit exploit was simply another, 
more refined,95 method of achieving 
the same goal. Since the MOVEit 
exploit was present to such a high 
degree, Ransomware decreased 
proportionately as Backdoor increased. 
However, the end result for Educational 
Services was the same: It helped 
criminals pay off their student loans 
rather rapidly.

sector.
Summary
System Intrusion has overtaken 
Miscellaneous Errors and Basic Web 
Application Attacks as the primary 
threat in Financial and Insurance this 
year, indicating a shift toward more 
complex attacks, accompanied by a 
rise in Social Engineering. Increased 
visibility into the Europe, Middle East 
and Africa (EMEA) region shows us that 
Ransomware attacks are alive and well 
there as well.High as a 
Georgia pine
If our dataset is any indicator, interest 
rates and premiums aren’t the only things 
rising in the Financial and Insurance 
industry. The System Intrusion pattern, 
where most of the more complex 
attacks typically reside, has risen from 
its third-place position last year to first 
place this year (Figure 60). The Social 
Engineering pattern, also typically a sign 
of increased complexity, is now in the top Financial and 
Insurance
NAICS 
52
2024 DBIR Industriesthree patterns as well, while the more 
simplistic Basic Web Application Attacks 
(last year’s champion) has fallen entirely 
off the podium. This is in relatively stark 
contrast to last year’s findings in which 
we pointed out that the adversaries 
weren’t having to expend a great deal of 
effort to gain access to corporate data 
in this vertical. These changes seem 
to indicate that attackers are being 
forced to work a bit harder in order to 
compromise organizations in this sector. 
That is good news for everybody—
except the threat actor, of course.63
 2024 DBIR IndustriesLest they make it simply too difficult 
for criminals, this vertical remains 
consistent in committing Errors. 
As was almost universally the case 
this year, Misdelivery was quite 
prominent (Figure 61) and, along with 
Misconfiguration and Loss, made up 
most of the errors in this industry.
Has any action 
been taken?
With regard to Action varieties, they 
tell the story of the patterns relatively 
clearly. Ransomware and the Use 
of stolen credentials, the bread and 
butter of the System Intrusion pattern, 
are very common in this industry 
(and help boost that 95% Financial 
motive). All of those stolen credentials 
have to come from somewhere, and 
that somewhere is frequently from 
social attacks such as Phishing and 
Pretexting. Of course credentials can 
also come from a multitude of other 
sources such as Brute force attacks 
(although it was quite low on the list for 
hacking actions) or simply harvested 
and reused from another breach.
Lastly, but certainly worthy of mention, 
is that 8% of the cases in our incident 
dataset targeting this sector were 
part of the whirlwind of the MOVEit 
breach, which shows how far-reaching 
supply chain breaches can be. Figure 61. Top Error varieties in

Summary
This year’s Healthcare sector analysis 
reveals significant shifts compared to 
previous years. Insiders deliberately 
causing breaches have surged back 
into second place after a steady decline 
since 2018. Interestingly, Personal data 
has eclipsed Medical data as the 
preferred target for threat actors.
2024 DBIR IndustriesFigure 62. Top patterns in Healthcare industry breachesTheir condition 
is rapidly 
evolving.
We certainly didn’t require X-rays 
to diagnose the changes in the 
Healthcare industry this year. There 
are a wealth of differences from last 
year to this year, so let’s dive in and 
take a look. There has been a trend of 
decreasing malicious insider threats 
in the Healthcare sector since 2018 
(Figure 62). However, we saw that trend 
beginning to reverse itself to some 
degree last year. It has continued to 
make up lost ground and now holds 
the second-place spot this year. This is 
even more worthy of mention when you 
consider Privilege Misuse wasn’t even 
in the top three last year.As a result, the Internal actor has taken 
back the driver’s seat in this industry. 
Whether wreaking malevolent mischief 
in terms of Privilege Misuse or simply 
making a hefty dose of innocent 
mistakes, resulting in the Miscellaneous 
Errors pattern taking the top spot in 
this year’s rankings, insiders are making 
quite the comeback in this sector. Not 
unlike almost every other industry on 
which we report, the error that appears 
to be the most beloved is Misdelivery 
(sending information to the wrong 
recipient, whether by electronic or 
physical means) (Figure 63). Loss is in 
second place and primarily consists of 
the misplacement of paper documents, 
which is bad for the organization 
and the environment. Lastly, we have 
Gaffe (a DBIR team favorite), which is 
when people simply blurt out sensitive 
data in the hearing of others.65
 2024 DBIR IndustriesFigure 64 . Top Attribute varieties in 
Healthcare industry breaches (n=1,102)Finally, a point of particular interest to 
the team was that Medical data, usually 
the most commonly stolen data type in 
this sector, doesn’t even get a passing 
nod (Figure 64). It seems that Personal 
data is the flavor of the year for threat 
actors, and they don’t really care about 
Aunt Bertha’s bunions.

The team found this 
somewhat interesting 
considering how many 
more breaches we 
had in this sector as 
compared to last year.
Summary
The overall breach sample size 
increased compared to last year, but 
this sector experienced substantially 
fewer incidents. Ransomware and 
Use of stolen credentials continue 
to dominate the System Intrusion 
pattern, while there was a slight 
decrease in Phishing attacks alongside 
a rise in Pretexting within the Social 
Engineering pattern. There was a mild 
increase in Espionage motives and 
state-sponsored actors targeting the 
industry, emphasizing the need for 
enhanced detective controls.Information
NAICS 
51
As we have mentioned elsewhere 
in this report, our overall breach 
sample size was greater than last 
year. However, the Information sector 
showed 741 fewer incidents this year. 
It did boast a much higher number 
of breaches. The top patterns for 
this vertical remain the same, and 
so does their order (Figure 65). 
Ransomware and the Use of stolen 
creds (a combination that makes up 
much of the System Intrusion pattern) 
remain in the top action varieties as one 
might expect. With regard to breaches 
in the Social Engineering pattern, we 
saw a slight dip in Phishing attacks 
along with a corresponding rise in 
Pretexting. This could be one indicator 
that the threat actors are being 
forced to deploy more sophisticated 
techniques against their targets.This year, EMEA dominates the 
dataset in this sector in particular, with 
243 confirmed Information industry 
breaches as opposed to just 97 in 
Northern America. These incidents 
have been contributed by some of our 
new law enforcement and regulatory 
bodies in the region. This is what robust 
data protection regulation looks like.
Finally, we did see a mild increase in 
the Espionage motive (14% this year 
as opposed to 8% in the 2023 report). 
We also saw a combined increase of 
the Nation-state/State-affiliated actors 
from 12% last year to 15% in this sector 
currently. While this is not a statistically 
significant finding, it is never good news 
to find that your industry is increasingly 
being targeted by more sophisticated 
threat actors (even if only slightly). 
Nevertheless, it serves as a reminder to 
ensure that you have detective controls 
in place to give you an early warning if 
you become a target.

This year’s 
model
This year’s Manufacturing model 
comes with a new and improved 
feature: Errors! As in most other 
industries, Misdelivery is the error 
du jour, accounting for almost half 
(48%) of error-related breaches. As 
we have mentioned elsewhere, this is 
in part the result of contributor bias, 
but nevertheless, sending things to 
the incorrect recipient does appear to 
be somewhat widespread regardless 
of vertical. Loss and Misconfiguration 
round out the top three error varieties, 
and they account for approximately 
20% and 18% of breaches, respectively.Frequency 2,305 incidents,

Summary

in Error-related breaches. The 
installation of malware after hacking 
via the Use of stolen credentials 
is somewhat commonplace.Manufacturing
NAICS 
31–33
2024 DBIR IndustriesFigure 66. Top patterns over time in Manufacturing industry breachesSystem Intrusion continues to hold 
on to the top spot in Manufacturing. 
This is probably related to the still 
very effective combination of hacking 
via Use of stolen credentials (present 
in 25% of manufacturing breaches) 
to gain access to the environment 
and then the liberal application of 
Ransomware (involved in 35% of 
breaches in this vertical). It’s hard 
to keep the gadgets rolling off the 
assembly line when your data is  
locked up tight and someone else  
holds the keys.68
 2024 DBIR IndustriesIt’s your asset 
on the (manu ­
facturing) line.
Social Engineering remains steady with 
regard to breaches in this vertical due 
to action varieties such as Phishing 
(55%) and Pretexting (42%). Apparently, 
consumer feedback branded the Basic 
Web Application Attacks pattern as so 
2022, and it now languishes near the 
bottom of the pattern rankings with the 
likes of Privilege Misuse. In fact, the 
asset of Server–Web app has been on a 
slightly downward trajectory. Figure 67 
illustrates this decline and also shows 
the corresponding rise of Server–Mail. 
This makes sense when, as mentioned 
above, one considers that Phishing 
remains prevalent in the Manufacturing 
vertical. Of course, the credentials 
typically obtained via phishing are those 
that afford the criminal a foothold into 
the organization via the email account 
of the victim.

Casting 
wide nets
While the use of NAICS codes is 
helpful, we realize that they are not 
always the ideal way of creating peer 
groups. That is particularly the case 
with this industry, as the wide net it 
casts includes diverse organizations 
such as interior designers and 
nanotech companies. This industry 
does illustrate the types of breaches 
that affect most industries, whether 
they were intentional or accidental. 
Let’s take a look at the breakdown. 
Like many industries, we see Social 
Engineering and System Intrusion 
in the top patterns, although there’s 
also the inclusion of Miscellaneous 
Errors as seen in Figure 69.
2024 DBIR IndustriesWhen it comes to intentional breaches, 
the vast majority of those cases fall 
into two buckets: Ransomware and the 
BEC, at 24% and 20% respectively. 
This isn’t the first time that we’ve seen 
Ransomware in the top three, but it is 
one of the first times that we’ve seen 
such headway with Pretexting attacks. 
These have increased significantly 
from last year and now account for 
40% of breaches. Lastly, organizations 
need to continue to protect the keys 
to the kingdom, with Credentials 
showing up in 34% of the breaches.
Although these credentials provide an 
important beachhead for criminals, we 
simply can’t forget the unintentional (or 
rarely intentional) insider. Even though 
25% of breaches involved someone 
coming in from within the organization, 
the majority of them are Misdeliveries 
(12%), while only a handful involve 
individuals abusing their position (5%). 
This helps us remember that there are 
many more folks who are maladroit 
than malicious.

Summary
Miscellaneous Errors, particularly 
Misdelivery, have surged to the top 
spot in this industry, reflecting the 
commonality of mistakes leading 
to breaches. System Intrusion now 
ranks second, followed by Social 
Engineering. The predominance 
of internal actors underscores the 
potential consequences of employee 
carelessness, with Errors accounting 
for the majority of breaches.Owning up to 
your mistakes 
in public
Due to some of our new data 
contributors reporting on mandatory 
breach disclosures, there was an 
ascendency of the Miscellaneous 
Errors attack pattern to the top spot 
in this industry (Figure 70).96 The most 
common error in Public Administration 
was Misdelivery, where information 
(in whatever form) is delivered to the 
wrong recipient. While this happens 
frequently via email, it is also quite 
common with printed documents and, 
strangely, faxes. The Lost and Stolen 
Assets pattern (in second place last 
year) is no longer among the top three 
in spite of a rather impressive showing 
by Loss.Actions speak 
louder than 
campaign 
promises.
Just as we see in the other 
verticals, System Intrusion and 
Social Engineering incidents remain 
commonplace and account for the 
next two patterns in this industry, 
respectively. While hacking only 
appeared in 31% of Public Sector 
breaches, it is clear that threat actors 
are still voting for the Use of stolen 
creds, which were involved in 83% 
of hacking-related breaches, mostly 
against web applications.
2024 DBIR Industries96 We discuss in the “Results and analysis – Actors” section how mandatory breach reporting helps 
everyone understand the truer prevalence of breach causes.Figure 70. Top patterns over time in Public Administration industry breaches71
 2024 DBIR IndustriesMalware figured in 27% of Public 
Sector breaches this year. Not unlike 
many other verticals, Ransomware was 
top of the heap with regard to malware 
varieties and accounted for 61% of 
malware-related breaches. Backdoors 
appeared in 38% of breaches involving 
malware, after which we saw a tight 
pack of several varieties jockeying for 
the third-place spot as illustrated in 
Figure 71.
The Social Engineering attacks we 
saw in Public Administration were 
mostly garden-variety Phishing (66% 
of breaches) and Pretexting (23%) 
attacks. No less concerning, but not 
really noteworthy in relation to the  
other findings.Actors 
behaving badly
The fact that Internal actors are the top 
threat this year underlines the fact that 
even the most well-meaning employees 
can trigger a data breach simply by being 
careless. For all actors, Error actions 
accounted for 51% of the cases, while 
malicious internal actors only accounted 
for 8%. Figure 72 is an illustration of 
how the road to breaches is paved with 
good intentions.
If we set aside the error-related 
breaches and the End-users who 
cause them, the most common external 
actors in this vertical were Organized 
crime (largely Ransomware attacks) at 
67% and State-affiliated actors (29%) 
(Figure 73). And while we saw very little 
change in Espionage threat actors, 
we did see a slight uptick in financially 
motivated attacks.

this sector.
Summary
While this industry is usually the 
place where we see Payment card 
data stolen, the focus of the threat 
actors has shifted to Credentials. 
Pretexting is also increasing, while 
Phishing has dropped. Denial of 
Service attacks remain a problem 
for Retail organizations, causing 
disruption to their ability to serve 
their customers and make sales.The Retail sector is where we often 
find “Magecart” threat actors. They are 
particularly skilled at inserting malicious 
code into the e-commerce sites of 
retail entities to siphon off (usually) 
Payment card information. We saw 
roughly the same percentage of these 
kinds of attacks this year as we did 
last year (Figure 74). However, the type 
of data being compromised showed a 
surprising change.
With Credentials standing at 38% 
(very close to last year’s 35%) we 
didn’t expect to see Payment card 
data drop to 25% (from 37%). Now, 
we understand how attractive and 
2024 DBIR Industriesuseful Credentials are to your average 
threat actor, but we were stunned to 
see Payment card data, so useful for 
immediate fraud, drop so precipitously 
(Figure 75). As we have indicated 
before, we get the “what” of the 
changes in the data, but we do not 
always get the “why.” Is this a result 
of increased controls around the 
monetization of payment card data, 
making it harder for the criminals to use 
the data they have stolen? Or is it just 
that credentials are so much easier to 
steal? Either way, we will be interested 
to see if this is just a blip on the radar or 
an actual trend starting.
Figure 74. Top patterns over time in Retail industry breaches73
 2024 DBIR IndustriesIn social-related breaches, Pretexting 
has emerged triumphant over Phishing 
as the top social action. It is good to 
see that the threat actors were required 
to step up their game to successfully 
influence their chosen targets. Dare we 
hope it is because people are becoming 
better educated and thus able to resist 
the run-of-the-mill phishing efforts? A 
suspicious user community is a well-
protected user community.
With regard to incidents, Denial of 
Service continues to represent a 
serious problem. While these attacks 
rarely result in confirmed data 
breaches, they do come with potentially 
serious disruption of the organization’s 
ability to function. We also saw 
Ransomware-related incidents continue 
to decline as they have since 2021.

Regions75
 2024 DBIR Regions Regional analysis
In this section, we once again examine cybercrime from a macro-regional point  
of view. We do this in the hope that it will be a quick and easy way for readers to 
learn how cybercrime trends differ and how they remain consistent from one 
geographical region of the world to the next. As always, our visibility into a given 
area is determined by many variables, including regional disclosure laws, our own 
dataset and where our data contributors conduct business. If you feel that your  
own patch of ground is not featured adequately in the following pages, please 
contact us about becoming a data contributor and motivate other organizations  
in your area to do the same. Please keep in mind that even if your region is not 
represented here, it doesn’t mean we have no visibility into the region but rather  
that we don’t have a sufficient number of incidents in that area to provide a 
statistically significant section.
We define the regions of the world in accordance with the United Nations M4997 
standards, which combine the super-region and sub-region of a country together. 
By so doing, the regions we will examine are as follows:
APAC:  Asia and the Pacific, including Southern Asia (034), South-eastern Asia 
(035), Central Asia (143), Eastern Asia (030) and Oceania (009)EMEA: Europe, Middle East and Africa, 
including Northern Africa (015), Europe 
(150) and Eastern Europe (151), and 
Western Asia (145)
NA: Northern America (021), which 
primarily consists of breaches in the 
United States and Canada
Many readers may recognize the At-
a-glance tables that we place at the 
top of each major section. We have 
combined them to provide a quick look 
at how each of the regions compares to 
the others with regard to the frequency 
of incidents, top patterns and so on.

Figure 78 . Top patterns over time in NA breachesAround the 
world in 4 
paragraphs
This year we were fortunate enough 
to have new contributors from 
EMEA join us. Due to the nature of 
contributing agencies along with the 
reporting requirements in that region, 
we have seen a substantial rise in 
the Miscellaneous Errors pattern. So 
much so that it is now the top pattern 
for the EMEA region. Any time we 
have a new contributor dataset that 
is larger in nature or has a propensity 
to report on specific types of actions 
(in this case, errors) we observe the 
resultant skewing of the data that one 
might expect. Perhaps next year we 
will be better positioned to determine 
if this jump in Miscellaneous Errors 
will continue or level out to be more 
consistent with the other patterns.
If we set aside the Error-heavy datasets 
and take a look at the regions through 
this lens, we can see that the System 
Intrusion pattern remains among the 
top for all regions. As always, the 
two main action types that we see 
represented in the System Intrusion 
pattern are hacking via the Use of 
stolen credentials and malware (most 
often) in the form of Ransomware. The 
“sans error” dataset also illustrates 
that the System Intrusion pattern has 
neither risen nor fallen significantly 
from last year but has instead held a 
relatively straight trajectory.98
Social Engineering, on the other hand, 
has increased somewhat significantly 
from 29% to 45% when viewed across 
the whole dataset (mostly driven by 
Northern America, where it represents 
56% of breaches). Extortion was the 
greatest driver of this growth in NA as 
it was present in 46% of its breaches. 
Our other Social Engineering favorites 
had a more timid showing in Northern 
America breaches: 13% for Phishing 
and 4% for Pretexting.

98 Unlike interest rates77 2024 DBIR Regions With regard to actors, the majority of 
cybercrime continues to be carried 
out by financially motivated external 
parties. One notable exception is 
that of APAC, where instead of more 
than 90% of attacks being financially 
motivated, we see that the Espionage 
motive is greater than it is elsewhere 
and accounts for 25% of breaches 
(as opposed to between 4% and 
6% in the other regions). As a result, 
99 https://www.csa.gov.sgBuilding a trusted and resilient 
cyberspace requires collective effort 
and partnership from both governments 
and the industry. Neither of us can 
do this by ourselves; we share the 
responsibility of securing cyberspace 
for all users. Forging strong public-
private partnerships is necessary 
for strengthening cybersecurity on 
multiple fronts. This can include 
threat intelligence sharing to enhance 
visibility, conducting joint operations to 
combat sophisticated cyber threats, or 
jointly investing in the development of 
much needed capabilities.
This is why the Cyber Security Agency 
of Singapore (CSA) is committed 
towards developing deep partnerships 
with the industry. CSA has various 
Memoranda of Understanding with 
important industry partners that helps 
us to tackle cybersecurity issues of 
the day together. These memoranda 
allow us to take on collaborative 
efforts, including the detection of 
global malicious cyber or information 
campaigns, and joint development of 
mobile security measures to ensure 
that Singapore’s users are protected 
from common instances of malware. 
For example, CSA partnered with 
Google to pilot a new enhanced 
protection feature within Google Play 
Protect to further safeguard Android 
mobile users against malware-enabled 
scams. This enhanced protection 
feature will analyze and automatically 
block the installation of apps from Internet sideloaded sources—browsers, 
messaging apps and file managers—
that declare their intent to use sensitive 
permissions that are frequently used 
for financial fraud and scams.
These collaborations also extend 
towards policy areas. This year, CSA 
updated Singapore’s cybersecurity 
legislation. This update was done in 
consultation with industry partners 
and other stakeholders to understand 
emerging challenges in cyberspace 
and seek their views on how to ensure 
Singapore’s regulatory approach meets 
our policy intent, but is practical and 
commensurate to the cybersecurity 
risks represented by different essential 
service sectors and types of digital 
infrastructure or service.
CSA strongly believes that the industry 
has a crucial part to play in our 
collective cybersecurity, and can start 
by securing their products and services 
by design and default. This is especially 
important for the most vulnerable 
groups in society. This is why CSA 
has developed a “Safe App Standard” 
to help app developers and providers 
enhance the security of their mobile 
apps. We encourage DBIR readers to 
access these guidelines and more at 
CSA’s website.99
CSA looks forward to deepening  
our partnership with industry to further 
improve the security of our cyberspace.the data variety of Internal accounts 
for 37%, while Secrets is at 24% for 
APAC. These data types typically 
do not appear in the top three spots 
for the other regions. Meanwhile, 
Credentials make up a whopping 69% 
of compromised data in APAC. As we 
mentioned in the 2023 DBIR, while 
we frequently have visibility into what 
data types are stolen, we do not always 
know the details to explain precisely 
From the 
Cyber Security 
Agency of 
Singaporewhy. We do know that regulatory 
requirements differ from one region to 
the next and, consequently, this may 
make some types of data harder to get 
than others. However, it is clear that 
Credentials and Personal data figure 
prominently in cybercrime regardless of 
where you are located. 78
 2024 DBIR Regions We now draw your attention to the 
heatmap that is Figure 79. While it 
may not be as captivating to look at 
as the Mona Lisa, it is more useful, for 
enterprises at least. This map illustrates 
how different (or similar) attacks are 
based on geography (sort of like the At-
a-glance section, but with much more 
detail). The heatmap shows incidents 
and breaches broken down into the

types and top asset varieties. This is 
a very handy tool to help you locate 
potential problem areas in your region.
Hopefully you will find this (especially 
when combined with other data found 
in this report, such as industry and 
organization size) informative with 
regard to what your organization might 
be more prone to in terms of attacks 
and can therefore assist you in creating

2024 DBIR Wrap-upMonthly snapshot as reported by the VTRAC Monthly Intelligence Briefings. If you’d like to 
learn more, feel free to reach out to the VTRAC team at Intel.Briefing@verizon.com .
JanuaryThe VTRAC’s cyber intelligence collections in January reflected most of the recurring information security 
(InfoSec) risk issues we would observe through the rest of 2023. Ransomware continued to plague every 
sector. For example, the LockBit threat actors (TAs) attacked the Royal Mail on January 11, disrupting postal 
operations for more than six weeks. Atlantic General Hospital in Berlin, Maryland, was among the first 
healthcare organizations struck with ransomware. Vulnerabilities in FortiOS secure sockets layer (SSL) VPN 
products were exploited by Chinese APT actors attacking government networks and an African managed 
service provider. Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) actors continued to attack Ukraine. COLDRIVER 
attempted to breach Brookhaven, Argonne and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories using spear 
phishing and fake login pages. Noteworthy zero-day vulnerabilities that were exploited before patch availability 
were CVE-2023-21674, a Windows advanced local procedure call (ALPC) elevation of privilege vulnerability, 
and CVE-2023-22952, a remote code execution vulnerability in SugarCRM’s email templates. Month’s end 
brought news of a multinational operation to disrupt the Hive ransomware TA that began in July 2022 and had 
provided decryption keys to more than 1,000 victims.
FebruaryA preauthentication command injection vulnerability in Fortra’s GoAnywhere MFT (managed file transfer) 
solution, labeled CVE-2023-0669, was a zero-day vulnerability that came to light in the first week of the 
month. Within days, we learned of a GoAnywhere MFT-related breach of more than 1 million patient records 
from the Community Health System. The Cl0p ransomware gang exploited GoAnywhere to steal data from 
more than a hundred companies beginning on January 18. The vulnerability was exploited in data breaches 
for several months only to be supplanted in June by a new zero-day vulnerability in another managed file 
transfer solution, Progress Software’s MOVEit. Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday included patches for three zero-day 
vulnerabilities and Apple also patched a zero-day in WebKit. North Korean APT, the Lazarus Group, conducted 
the No Pineapple! campaign to exfiltrate more than 100 GB of data from organizations in medical research, 
healthcare, chemical engineering, energy and defense as well as a leading research university. The city of 
Oakland, California, declared a state of emergency following a ransomware infection that disrupted most city 
services. Both the Play and LockBit TA claimed credit.
March3CX is a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) private branch exchange (PBX) software development company 
whose 3CX Phone System is used by more than 350,000 customers worldwide and has more than 12 million 
daily users. A digitally signed and trojanized version of the 3CX VoIP desktop client was used to target the 
company’s customers in an ongoing supply chain attack. Attributed to the Lazarus Group, the ultimate payload 
was a backdoor Trojan, Gopuram. The attackers used Gopuram with surgical precision. Gopuram was installed 
on fewer than 10 targets, all of which were cryptocurrency companies. The 3CX campaign demonstrated 
significantly more sophisticated capabilities from North Korean APT actors. And near the end of the month, 
a new North Korean APT emerged, APT43. Initial reports indicated that APT43 used cybercrime to fund its 
cyberespionage campaigns. Winter Vivern, the APT aligned with the national security interests of Russia/
Belarus, was using malicious documents to collect credentials and exploit vulnerable Zimbra collaboration 
servers. Winter Vivern targeted government, military and diplomatic entities in nations supporting Ukraine. 
March’s zero-day vulnerabilities included Outlook, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and Adobe ColdFusion  
to keep patch management teams busy.82
 2024 DBIR Wrap-upAprilThe month began with the exploitation of two zero-day vulnerabilities in Apple products. Google mitigated 
a zero-day in its Chrome browser’s V8 JavaScript engine and then four days later rolled out a new version 
to mitigate a zero-day vulnerability in the Skia graphics engine. And Microsoft patched the second zero-day 
this year in its Common Log File System driver. Another zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2022-27926, affected 
Zimbra collaboration servers. The Winter Vivern APT actor had almost certainly discovered and exploited the 
vulnerability before the patch was announced. CERT Polska warned that the Russian APT29 was actively 
pursuing diplomatic targets in many nations, principally North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members. 
APT28 attacked vulnerable Cisco routers worldwide. The TTP of exploiting a 4-year-old vulnerability in 
network infrastructure was at once innovative and sufficiently simple to be adopted and adapted by many TAs. 
The GRU’s Sandworm Team continued to focus on support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Multiple top-tier 
cybercrime actors continued to compromise PaperCut and Fortra GoAnywhere MFT systems to install Cl0p, 
LockBit and BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware and frequently exfiltrated data from victim networks. Microsoft 
noted an increase in the pace and the scope of cyberattacks attributed to Iranian threat actors. For example, 
Mint Sandstorm (Charming Kitten) rapidly weaponized N-day vulnerabilities in common enterprise applications 
and conducted highly targeted phishing campaigns to quickly and successfully access environments of 
interest. The Mint Sandstorm APT began exploiting CVE-2022-47966 in Zoho ManageEngine on January 19, 
2023, the same day the proof of concept (PoC) became public.
MayA Chinese state-sponsored APT group dubbed Camaro Dragon was found infecting TP-Link routers with a 
malicious firmware implant that allowed attackers to gain full control of infected devices and access compromised 
networks while evading detection. The group overlaps with activity previously attributed to Mustang Panda. 
Mustang Panda was also observed conducting phishing campaigns against European entities. Other phishing 
emails delivered fake “official” Ukrainian government reports that downloaded malware onto compromised 
machines. Mustang Panda’s most used malicious implant was a Trojan program called PlugX, and it continued 
to remain the group’s preferred spying tool. A new Chinese aligned APT actor, Volt Typhoon was identified after 
it had been found targeting critical infrastructure organizations in Guam and elsewhere in the United States 
since mid-2021. Barracuda identified a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-2868) in its Email Security Gateway 
(ESG) appliance on May 19. A security patch to eliminate the vulnerability was applied to all ESG appliances 
worldwide on May 20. Microsoft Patch Tuesday included two zero-day vulnerabilities. Apple released security 
advisories and patches mitigating more than 30 vulnerabilities, including three zero-day exploits affecting 
WebKit. On May 31, Progress Software released patches for a SQL injection vulnerability in MOVEit managed 
file transfer software. Labeled CVE-2023-34362, we later learned exploitation began on May 27.
JuneMOVEit moved into the mainstream. VTRAC began receiving a large number of victim reports—and we were 
still getting them as this went to press in February 2024. (MOVEit would continue to wreak havoc throughout 
the year, with multiple cybersecurity experts reporting increasing numbers of organizations and individuals 
affected.)100,101,102,103 There were indications the Cl0p ransomware TA had been testing MOVEit exploits in 
2021. At least 1,000 organizations became victims, and personally identifiable information (PII) of at least 
100 million individuals was compromised. The Russian APT Gamaredon Group attacked Ukraine featuring 
a PowerShell-based information stealer distributed on malicious USB thumb drives. Google released a new 
version of its Chrome browser to mitigate a vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript engine that was already being 
exploited in the wild. A zero-day vulnerability in Fortinet’s FortiOS and FortiProxy SSL-VPN preauthentication 
was being exploited in the wild. After May’s alert for CVE-2023-2868, on June 6, Barracuda announced 
any ESG appliance that had been compromised must be taken out of service and disposed of; patching was 
insufficient. Kaspersky’s security architecture detected suspicious activity originating from several iOS-based 
phones. It discovered a targeted APT campaign that it labeled Operation Triangulation. The target iOS device 
received a zero-click message via the iMessage service with an attachment containing an exploit. With no 
user interaction, the message triggered a vulnerability that led to code execution. After installation of the 
APT payload, the message was deleted. On June 21, Apple patched the Operation Triangulation zero-day 
vulnerabilities in the iOS kernel and in WebKit.

 2024 DBIR Wrap-upJulyThe top three ransomware TAs had a very good July. That is, InfoSec practitioners spent July avoiding 
successful attacks by LockBit, Cl0p and ALPHV. On Monday, July 4, the port of Nagoya, Japan, was struck 
by LockBit 3.0. Cl0p continued to take advantage of more than 130 organizations they had breached in May 
and June before MOVEit was patched. ALPHV (BlackCat) used search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning 
and malvertisements to lure users into downloading a trojanized WinSCP (Windows Secure Copy Protocol), 
leading to lateral exploitation, data theft and ransomware infection. A Chinese APT labeled Storm-0558 
acquired a Microsoft account (MSA) consumer key from a Microsoft engineer’s system using an arcane 
series of loopholes. That key enabled the group to access Outlook and Outlook Web Access (OWA) accounts 
affecting about 25 organizations, including government agencies. Five zero-day vulnerabilities were mitigated 
on Microsoft Patch Tuesday. Zimbra Collaboration Suite contained a cross-site scripting zero-day vulnerability 
affecting the confidentiality and integrity of data. Adobe released an update to ColdFusion on Patch Tuesday. 
Three days later, Adobe released an out-of-cycle security bulletin for a deserialization zero-day vulnerability in 
ColdFusion. Two new zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile were exploited to breach the 
IT systems of a dozen ministries in Norway. Citrix released an advisory and patches for three vulnerabilities in 
NetScaler (formerly Citrix) application delivery controller (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway. CISA advised that one 
NetScaler vulnerability had been exploited to breach the network of a U.S. critical infrastructure organization in 
June. On August 2, we learned that 640 NetScaler servers had been backdoored by an unidentified TA and a 
China Chopper web shell installed.
AugustMultiple sources reported a decline in ransomware attacks in the range of 20%–33%. An ongoing espionage 
campaign targeting dozens of organizations in Taiwan was discovered. Researchers attributed the activity 
to a new Chinese APT group labeled Flax Typhoon. The threat group minimizes the use of custom malware 
and instead uses legitimate tools found in victims’ operating systems to conduct its espionage operations 
(living off the land). VTRAC collected intelligence for another new APT, labeled Carderbee. That TA mounted 
a supply chain attack weaponizing updates from a Chinese security company to install a code-signed version 
of the PlugX backdoor to attack about 100 computers, mostly in Hong Kong. The North Korean Lazarus Group 
fielded new remote access trojans (RATs), QuiteRAT and CollectionRAT, and there were indications that the 
Lazarus Group was also shifting to “living off the land” TTP. The FBI announced a global operation against the 
Qbot (aka Qakbot). In Operation Duck Hunt, the FBI seized control of the botnet, removed the malware from 
infected devices and identified a substantial number of affected systems. As with many malware takedowns, 
the core cybercriminals were not arrested or confined, and Qbot would begin a comeback in December. 
Microsoft Patch Tuesday included mitigation of two exploited zero-day vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-38180 
(patched) and CVE-2023-36884 (not patched).
SeptemberCaesars Entertainment discovered on September 7 that the ALPHV ransomware TA had performed a social 
engineering attack that targeted an outsourced IT support vendor resulting in a breach of Caesars’ network 
and its loyalty program database, which stores driver’s license numbers and Social Security numbers for many 
customers. Caesars chose to pay roughly half of the $30 million ransom to recover its data. On September 11, 
MGM Resorts International disclosed the ALPHV ransomware TA had breached MGM’s network using social 
engineering, then stole sensitive data and encrypted more than a hundred ESXi hypervisors. MGM informed 
the SEC that the cyberattack cost the company $100 million. Akira ransomware threat actors were targeting 
Cisco VPNs that were not configured for MFA to infiltrate organizations. Cisco released an advisory for 
vulnerability in the remote access VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco 
Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a brute force 
attack in an attempt to identify valid username and password combinations. In August, Cisco became aware 
of attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild. The University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab reported that 
iOS zero-day vulnerabilities were exploited to install NSO Group’s Pegasus commercial spyware. Microsoft 
Patch Tuesday included two zero-day vulnerabilities. The WebP Codec is used in countless applications and 
websites, and it had a zero-day vulnerability with attacks reported by Apple and Google. Adobe released an 
out-of-cycle advisory and patch to mitigate a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat 
and Reader.84
 2024 DBIR Wrap-upOctoberIn an advisory sent to an undisclosed number of customers on October 19, Okta said it had “identified 
adversarial activity that leveraged access to a stolen credential to access Okta’s support case management 
system.” An Okta spokesperson said the company notified about 1% of its customer base (~170 customers), 
including 1Password and Cloudflare. On October 7, Hamas invaded Israel, triggering significant unrest. Within 
an hour, the Russian-affiliated group Anonymous Sudan claimed responsibility for potentially disabling an 
Israeli civilian app designed to alert citizens about missile attacks. Hacktivists aligned with each side of the 
conflict began conducting DoS attacks as well as hack-and-leak and defacements. For the most part, nation-
state aligned APT actors conducted limited or no offensive cyber conflict activities targeting Hamas or Israel. 
Organizations with Atlassian’s Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server reported compromises. 
Atlassian determined that a zero-day access control vulnerability, CVE-2023-22515, was being exploited. 
Apple released updates to iOS and iPadOS to address two more zero-day vulnerabilities. Three zero-days 
were among 104 security updates on Microsoft Patch Tuesday. Cisco and multiple intelligence sources have 
been tracking attacks exploiting a chain of two zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE software enabling 
creation of new accounts and implanting remote control malware.
NovemberAfter a significant drop in observed ransomware attacks in September and October, November saw numbers 
rebound more to where we expected them to be. Carbanak, a well-known banking malware, returned from 
relative obscurity controlled by the FIN7 APT-grade cybercrime actor. Multiple sources linked FIN7 to 
Carbanak, Cl0p and ALPHV ransomware TAs. HelloKitty ransomware was attacking a zero-day vulnerability 
in Apache ActiveMQ, the popular open source, multiprotocol message broker. A zero-day vulnerability in 
SysAid IT service management software was being exploited by the Cl0p ransomware actors. The Russian 
APT Sandworm group was responsible for attacks against 22 critical infrastructure organizations in Denmark. 
November’s Patch Tuesday addressed 77 Microsoft patches, among them, Microsoft-released patches for 
three new zero-day vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. Two F5 Big IP vulnerabilities were being attacked 
within five days of release of security advisories and patches. Chrome browser and multiple Apple products 
patched zero-day vulnerabilities. The Chinese APT, Mustang Panda, conducted cyberespionage campaigns 
targeting organizations in the Philippines and western Pacific Rim region.
DecemberThe Cyber Av3ngers, a hacktivist TA affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), took 
responsibility for defacing workstations at Pennsylvania’s Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa. The TA 
reportedly hit multiple water utility companies in the United States by targeting Unitronics’ PLC devices. 
Ukraine’s largest mobile operator, Kyivstar, was hit by a cyberattack that left its system infrastructure 
extensively damaged and knocked it out of operation for days. The Solntsepek TA—which had been previously 
linked to the notorious Sandworm Group—claimed the attack a day later, stating that it had destroyed 10,000 
computers, more than 4,000 servers, all cloud storage and backup systems. Google’s Chrome browser, 
QNAP’s VioStor network video recorder and Future X Communications’ wireless LAN routers AE1021PE and 
AE1021 each patched new vulnerabilities that had already been successfully exploited in the wild. Barracuda 
ESG appliances had a zero-day vulnerability that was being successfully exploited by a Chinese threat 
actor. Midmonth, Microsoft warned that Qbot (Qakbot) was being distributed again in a phishing campaign 
pretending to be an email from an IRS employee.7

 2024 DBIR AppendicesAppendix A: 
How to read 
this report
Hello, and welcome first-time readers! Before you get started 
on the 2024 DBIR, it might be a good idea to take a look at 
this appendix first. We have been doing this report for a while 
now, and we appreciate that the verbiage we use can be a bit 
obtuse at times. We use very deliberate naming conventions, 
terms and definitions and spend a lot of time making sure we 
are consistent throughout the report. Hopefully this section 
will help make all of those more familiar.
VERIS Framework resources
The terms “threat actions,” “threat actors” and “varieties” will be referenced often. 
These are part of the Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS), 
a framework designed to allow for a consistent, unequivocal collection of security 
incident details. Here is how they should be interpreted:
Threat actor:  Who is behind the event? This could be the external “bad guy” who 
launches a phishing campaign or an employee who leaves sensitive documents in 
their seat back pocket.
Threat action:  What tactics (actions) were used to affect an asset? VERIS uses 
seven primary categories of threat actions: Malware, Hacking, Social, Misuse, 
Physical, Error and Environmental. Examples at a high level are hacking a server, 
installing malware or influencing human behavior through a social attack.
Variety:  More specific enumerations of higher-level categories—e.g., classifying the 
external “bad guy” as an organized criminal group or recording a hacking action as 
SQL injection or brute force.

• https://github.com/vz-risk/veris —features information on the framework with

We talk a lot about incidents  
and breaches and we use the  
following definitions:
Incident:  A security event that 
compromises the integrity, 
confidentiality or availability of an 
information asset.
Breach: An incident that results in the 
confirmed disclosure—not just potential 
exposure—of data to an unauthorized 
party. A DDoS attack, for instance, is 
most often an incident rather than a 
breach since no data is exfiltrated.  
That doesn’t make it any less serious.
Industry labels
We align with the NAICS standard to 
categorize the victim organizations in 
our corpus. The standard uses two- to 
six-digit codes to classify businesses 
and organizations. Our analysis is 
typically done at the two-digit level, and 
we will specify NAICS codes along with 
an industry label. For example, a chart 
with a label of Financial (52) is not 
indicative of 52 as a value. “52” is the 
NAICS code for the Financial and 
Insurance sector. The overall label of 
“Financial” is used for brevity within the 
figures. Detailed information on the 
codes and the classification system are 
available here:
https://www.census.gov/
naics/?58967?yearbck=201287
Being confident of our data 
Starting in 2019 with slanted bar charts, 
the DBIR has tried to make the point 
that the only certain thing about 
information security is that nothing is 
certain. Even with all the data we have, 
we’ll never know anything with absolute 
certainty. However, instead of throwing 
our hands up and complaining that it is 
impossible to measure anything in a 
data-poor environment or, worse yet, 
just plain making stuff up, we get to 
work. This year, you’ll continue to see 
the team representing uncertainty 
throughout the report figures.
The examples shown in Figures 80,  
81, 82 and 83 all convey the range of 
realities that could credibly be true. 
Whether it be the slant of the bar chart, 
the threads of the spaghetti chart, the 
dots of the dot plot or the color of the 
pictogram plot, all convey the 
uncertainty of our industry in their own 
special way.
The slanted bar chart will be familiar 
to returning readers. The slant 
on the bar chart represents the 
uncertainty of that data point to 
a 95% confidence level (which is 
standard for statistical testing).
In layman’s terms, if the slanted areas of 
two (or more) bars overlap, you can’t 
really say one is bigger than the other 
without angering the math gods.Much like the slanted bar chart, the 
spaghetti chart represents the same 
concept: the possible values that exist 
within the confidence interval. However, 
it’s slightly more involved because we 
have the added element of time. The 
individual threads represent a sample of 
all possible connections between the 
points that exist within each 
observation’s confidence interval. As 
you can see, some of the threads are 
looser than others, indicating a wider 
confidence interval and a smaller 
sample size.
The dot plot is another returning 
champion, and the trick to 
understanding this chart is to 
remember that the dots represent 
organizations. If, for instance, there  
are 200 dots (like in Figure 82), each 
dot represents 0.5% of organizations. 
This is a much better way of 
understanding how something is 
distributed among organizations  
and provides considerably more 
information than an average or a 
median. We added more colors and 
callouts to those in an attempt to  
make them even more informative.

Figure 81. Example spaghetti chartThe pictogram plot, our relative 
newcomer, attempts to capture 
uncertainty in a similar way to slanted 
bar charts but is more suited for a 
single proportion.
We hope they make your journey 
through this complex dataset even 
smoother than previous years.

Appendix B: 
Methodology
One of the things readers value most 
about this report is the level of rigor and 
integrity we employ when collecting, 
analyzing and presenting data. Knowing 
our readership cares about such 
things and consumes this information 
with a keen eye helps keep us honest. 
Detailing our methods is an important 
part of that honesty.
First, we make mistakes. A column 
transposed here, a number not updated 
there. We’re likely to discover a few 
things to fix. When we do, we’ll list 
them on our corrections page:  https://
verizon.com/business/resources/
reports/dbir/2024/corrections .
Second, science comes in two flavors: 
creative exploration and causal 
hypothesis testing. The DBIR is 
squarely in the former. While we may 
not be perfect, we believe we provide 
the best obtainable version of the 
truth (to a given level of confidence 
and under the influence of biases 
acknowledged below). However, 
proving causality is best left to 
randomized control trials. The best  
we can do is correlation. And while 
correlation is not causation, they are 
often related to some extent and  
often useful.Non ­committal 
disclaimer
We would like to reiterate that we make 
no claim that the findings of this report 
are representative of all data breaches 
in all organizations at all times. Even 
though we believe the combined 
records from all our contributors 
more closely reflect reality than any 
of them in isolation, it is still a sample. 
And although we believe many of the 
findings presented in this report to be 
appropriate for generalization (and our 
conviction in this grows as we gather 
more data and compare it to that of 
others), bias exists.
The DBIR 
process
Our overall process remains intact 
and largely unchanged from previous 
years.104 All incidents included in this 
report were reviewed and converted (if 
necessary) into the VERIS framework 
to create a common, anonymous 
aggregate dataset. If you are unfamiliar 
with the VERIS framework, it is short 
for Vocabulary for Event Recording 
and Incident Sharing, it is free to use, 
and links to VERIS resources appear 
throughout this report.The collection method and conversion 
techniques differed between 
contributors. In general, three basic 
methods (expounded below) were  
used to accomplish this:
1.  Direct recording of paid external 
forensic investigations and related 
intelligence operations conducted by 
Verizon using the VERIS Webapp
2.   Direct recording by partners  
using VERIS
3.  Converting partners’ existing  
schema into VERIS
All contributors received instruction to 
omit any information that might identify 
organizations or individuals involved.
Some source spreadsheets are 
converted to our standard spreadsheet 
formatted through automated mapping 
to ensure consistent conversion. 
Reviewed spreadsheets and VERIS 
Webapp JavaScript Object Notation 
(JSON) are ingested by an automated 
workflow that converts the incidents 
and breaches within into the VERIS 
JSON format as necessary, adds 
missing enumerations, and then 
validates the record against business 
logic and the VERIS schema. The 
automated workflow subsets the data 
and analyzes the results. Based on 
the results of this exploratory analysis, 
the validation logs from the workflow 
and discussions with the partners 
providing the data, the data is cleaned 
and reanalyzed. This process runs 
nightly for roughly two months as data 
is collected and analyzed.

2024 DBIR Appendices89
 2024 DBIR AppendicesIncident data
Our data is non-exclusively multinomial, 
meaning that a single feature, such as 
“Action,” can have multiple values (i.e., 
“Social,” “Malware” and “Hacking”). 
This means that percentages do 
not necessarily add up to 100%. 
For example, if there are five botnet 
breaches, the sample size is five. 
However, since each botnet used 
phishing, installed keyloggers and used 
stolen credentials, there would be five 
Social actions, five Hacking actions and 
five Malware actions, adding up to 300%. 
This is normal, expected and handled 
correctly in our analysis and tooling.
Another important point is that when 
looking at the findings, “unknown” is 
equivalent to “unmeasured.” Which is 
to say that if a record (or collection of 
records) contains elements that have 
been marked as “unknown” (whether it 
is something as basic as the number of 
records involved in the incident or as 
complex as what specific capabilities a 
piece of malware contained), it means 
that we cannot make statements about 
that particular element as it stands in the 
record—we cannot measure where we 
have too little information. Because they 
are unmeasured, they are not counted in 
sample sizes. The enumeration “Other,” 
however, is counted because it means 
that the value was known but not part 
of VERIS (or not one of the other bars 
if found in a bar chart). Finally, “Not 
Applicable” (normally “n/a”) may be 
counted or not counted depending on 
the claim being analyzed.This year we have made liberal use  
of confidence intervals to allow us to 
analyze smaller sample sizes. We have 
adopted a few rules to help minimize 
bias in reading such data. Here we 
define “small sample” as less than  
30 samples.
1.  Sample sizes smaller than five are  
too small to analyze.
2.  We won’t talk about count or 
percentage for small samples.  
This goes for figures too and is  
why some figures lack the dot for  
the median frequency.
3.  For small samples, we may talk about 
the value being in some range or 
values being greater/less than each 
other. These all follow the confidence 
interval approaches listed above.
Incident 
eligibility
For a potential entry to be eligible for 
the incident/breach corpus, a couple  
of requirements must be met. The entry 
must be a confirmed security incident 
defined as a loss of confidentiality, 
integrity or availability. In addition to 
meeting the baseline definition of 
“security incident,” the entry is assessed for quality. We create a subset of 
incidents (more on subsets later) that 
pass our quality filter. The details of 
what is a “quality” incident are:
• The incident must have at least 
seven enumerations (e.g., threat 
actor variety, threat action category, 
variety of integrity loss, et al.) across 
34 fields OR be a DDoS attack. 
Exceptions are given to confirmed 
data breaches with less than seven 
enumerations.
• The incident must have at least one 
known VERIS threat action category 
(Hacking, Malware, etc.).
In addition to having the level of details 
necessary to pass the quality filter, 
the incident must be within the time 
frame of analysis (November 1, 2022, to 
October 31, 2023, for this report). The 
2023 caseload is the primary analytical 
focus of the report, but the entire 
range of data is referenced throughout, 
notably in trending graphs. We also 
exclude incidents and breaches 
affecting individuals that cannot be 
tied to an organizational attribute loss. 
If your friend’s laptop was hit with 
Trickbot, it would not be included in 
 this report.
Lastly, for something to be eligible for 
inclusion into the DBIR, we have to 
know about it, which brings us to several 
potential biases we will discuss below.90
Figure 87. Individual contributors  
per Attribute
Many breaches go unreported (though 
our sample does contain many of 
those). Many more are as yet unknown 
by the victim (and thereby unknown to 
us). Therefore, until we (or someone) The first type of bias is random 
bias introduced by sampling. This 
year, our maximum confidence is 
+/- 0.5% for incidents and +/- 0.8% 
for breaches, which is related to our 
sample size. Any subset with a smaller 
sample size is going to have a wider 
confidence margin. We’ve expressed 
this confidence in the complementary 
cumulative density (slanted) bar charts, 
hypothetical outcome plot (spaghetti) 
line charts and quantile dot plots.
The second source of bias is sampling 
bias. We strive for “the best obtainable 
version of the truth” by collecting 
breaches from a wide variety of 
contributors. Still, it is clear that we 
conduct biased sampling. For instance, 
some breaches, such as those publicly 
disclosed, are more likely to enter our 
corpus, while others, such as classified 
breaches, are less likely.
The four figures on the left are an 
attempt to visualize potential sampling 
bias. Each radial axis is a VERIS 
enumeration, and we have stacked 
bar charts representing our data 
contributors. Ideally, we want the 
distribution of sources to be roughly 
equal on the stacked bar charts along 
all axes. Axes only represented by 
a single source are more likely to be 
biased. However, contributions are 
inherently thick tailed, with a few 
contributors providing a lot of data 
and a lot of contributors providing a 
few records within a certain area. Still, 
we mostly see that most axes have 
multiple large contributors with small 
contributors adding appreciably to the 
total incidents along that axis.Acknowledgment and  
analysis of bias
can conduct an exhaustive census of 
every breach that happens in the entire 
world each year (our study population), 
we must use sampling. Unfortunately, 
this process introduces bias.

91
You’ll notice rather large contributions 
on many of the axes. While we’d 
generally be concerned about this, they 
represent contributions aggregating 
several other sources, not actual single 
contributions. It also occurs along most 
axes, limiting the bias introduced by 
that grouping of indirect contributors.
The third source of bias is confirmation 
bias. Because we use our entire dataset 
for exploratory analysis, we cannot test 
specific hypotheses. Until we develop 
a collection method for data breaches 
beyond a sample of convenience, this is 
probably the best that can be done.
As stated above, we attempt to mitigate 
these biases by collecting data from 
diverse contributors. We follow a 
consistent multiple-review process, and 
when we hear hooves, we think horses, 
not zebras.105 We also try to review 
findings with subject matter experts in 
the specific areas ahead of release.Data subsets
We already mentioned the subset 
of incidents that passed our quality 
requirements, but as part of our 
analysis, there are other instances 
where we define subsets of data. These 
subsets consist of legitimate incidents 
that would eclipse smaller trends if left 
in. These are removed and analyzed 
separately, though may not be written 
about if no relevant findings were, well, 
found. This year we have two subsets 
of legitimate incidents that are not 
analyzed as part of the overall corpus:
1.  We separately analyzed a subset of 
web servers that were identified as 
secondary targets (such as taking 
over a website to spread malware).
2.  We separately analyzed botnet-
related incidents.
Both subsets were separated the last 
seven years as well.
Finally, we create some subsets to 
help further our analysis. In particular, 
a single subset is used for all analysis 
within the DBIR unless otherwise 
stated. It includes only quality incidents 
as described above and excludes the 
aforementioned two subsets.Non ­incident 
data
Since the 2015 issue, the DBIR includes 
data that requires analysis that did not 
fit into our usual categories of “incident” 
or “breach.” Examples of non-incident 
data include malware, patching, 
phishing and DDoS. The sample sizes 
for non-incident data tend to be much 
larger than the incident data but from 
fewer sources. We make every effort 
to normalize the data (for example 
weighing records by the number 
contributed from the organization so all 
organizations are represented equally). 
We also attempt to combine multiple 
partners with similar data to conduct 
the analysis wherever possible. Once 
analysis is complete, we try to discuss 
our findings with the relevant partner or 
partners so as to validate it against their 
knowledge of the data.
105 A unique finding is more likely to be something mundane, such as a data collection issue, than an 
unexpected result.

U.S. Secret Service
By Assistant Director Brian 
Lambert and Assistant 
Special Agent in Charge 
Krzysztof Bossowski, United 
States Secret ServiceThe Secret Service is built on a 
foundation of protecting the integrity 
of our nation’s financial system. The 
agency was created in 1865 to address 
a surge in counterfeiting following the 
Civil War. Today, the agency continues 
to fight counterfeiting while also 
battling computer fraud and abuse, 
bank fraud, payment card fraud, identity 
theft, financial extortion, wire fraud, 
and more. Additionally, the Secret 
Service is charged with providing 
investigative assistance to local law 
enforcement and the National Center 
for Missing & Exploited Children. 
The continued success of the Secret 
Service’s investigative mission depends 
on partnerships with law enforcement 
agencies and private sector experts. 
The Secret Service operates a 
network of Cyber Fraud Task Forces 
(CFTF) throughout the country, which 
fosters these interactions with our 
partners. Long-term partnerships 
are the best mechanism to prevent 
and mitigate cybercrime.
The use of ransomware to exploit 
businesses again played a significant 
role in major data breaches. The 
criminal organizations behind these 
attacks heavily leveraged the crime-
as-a-service business model, including 
threatening to publish stolen data. 
The Secret Service, alongside its 
law enforcement and private sector 
partners, fought against these 
criminals. The team approach foiled 
several ransomware campaigns 
and protected a number of targeted 
American companies and organizations. 
Agents also infiltrated these criminal 
organizations and developed tangible

Cybercrime 
Amid 
T echnological 
Change
The U.S. Secret Service worked to 
combat fraud through traditional 
methods while identifying new threats 
driven by emerging technology in 
2023. Ransomware continued to 
feature prominently in data breaches 
impacting U.S. companies. Meanwhile, 
transnational cybercriminals were 
increasingly successful in finding 
innovative ways to enable their fraud 
schemes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
captured the world’s attention and 
imagination, and cybercriminals 
were among the early adopters. The 
Secret Service investigated numerous 
cybercriminals experimenting with 
these generative new tools to commit 
fraud. In response, the agency also 
partnered with the same technology 
companies these fraudsters relied 
upon for their schemes. This proved a 
valuable strategy to detect scams and 
hold bad actors accountable.93
 2024 DBIR Appendicesinformation for IT administrators. 
This enabled IT teams to implement 
countermeasures to protect their 
corporate infrastructure, significantly 
reducing data breaches and financial 
losses. Industry reports on ransomware 
show mixed trends in the prevalence 
and revenue generated through 
ransomware scams in 2023. Our work 
continues as we strive to end the 
profitability of such schemes.
Generative AI remains a hot topic. 
ChatGPT became a technological 
hit in January 2023 with 100 million 
registered active users. Legitimate 
customers used the AI tool to write 
papers and answer questions. But 
within weeks, criminals also leveraged 
AI tools in fraud and extortion schemes. 
For example, a Secret Service 
investigation led to the arrest of a group 
of individuals who used AI-powered 
translation tools. These individuals 
did not speak English or have any 
advanced computer skills. Yet, these 
bad actors used the new tools to create 
transnational romance and extortion 
plots to defraud victims of millions of 
dollars. The victims in these cases were 
not aware the translation was taking 
place or even that they were interacting 
with someone in a foreign country.To stay ahead of the criminal element, 
the Secret Service is increasingly 
partnering with technology companies 
to ensure new technology aids in 
preventing—rather than enabling—
crime. This includes measures that 
companies can implement to detect 
misuse of their tools and explore how 
these technologies can appropriately 
aid investigations. For example, our 
research teams and investigators 
increasingly face difficulty analyzing 
large digital data sets. However, 
new data analytic techniques can 
significantly improve our ability to 
detect and address illicit activity. 
These new techniques were used 
successfully in investigating a large-
scale fraud scheme impacting the 
state of California. Within a few weeks 
of work on this case, investigators 
identified patterns in the fraud schemes 
that resulted in Secret Service agents 
arresting five criminals withdrawing 
tens of thousands of dollars from 
ATMs using information stolen from 
California-based users of Electronic 
Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards.106 This 
case demonstrated how new data tools 
aid in analysis and have the potential to 
quickly detect and address illicit activity 
in both the public and private sectors.
106 https://www.secretservice.gov/newsroom/releases/2023/06/five-charged-theft-california-
benefits-low-income-familiesWhether battling ransomware, credit 
card fraud, or protecting minors from 
online child predators, the Secret 
Service works to stay on the cutting 
edge of technology. New technology 
enables criminals and investigators 
alike, and our private sector and law 
enforcement partnerships are the 
key to detecting and preventing illicit 
activity. Our network of Cyber Fraud 
Task Forces will continue to foster 
regular interaction with our partners to 
promote the prevention and mitigation 
of cybercrime with the critical goal of 
protecting America’s financial interests. 
Working together, we can identify and 
implement ways to use technology 
effectively to prevent crime.94

contributed to incidents. Aggregating 
data based on industries (right down

questions, like what industries are 
more or less susceptible to which 
kinds of attacks, or what attack 
methods are most or least commonly 
associated with which asset classes. 
If you were patient and skilled you 
could also find out what kinds of 
attacks trended higher or lower 
year-over-year, or which assets 
and methods are most frequently 
correlated with each other in attacks.
If your heart rate went up while 
reading that previous paragraph, 
then you’re our kind of people. But 
as much fun as we were having, 
we had to focus on our purpose: 
find the simplest way to model risk 
probability for the widest population.The VCDB was a leap forward in 
incident sharing. For CIS and HALOCK 
it’s been a solid foundation for risk 
analysis. One of the biggest challenges 
in conducting risk assessments is 
estimating the likelihood that an 
incident will occur. The VCDB contains 
a lot of structured incident data, so we 
were sure we could use it to somehow 
help us solve that challenge.
When we started exploring the VCDB 
together, it held about 7,500 incident 
records—each with about 2,500 data 
points—telling us how each incident 
occurred. But that’s almost 19 million 
data points! How could we shape 
that data to help the CIS community 
estimate risks?
We experimented and discovered many 
useful aggregations that brought shape 
and meaning to the mass of recorded 
incidents. By focusing on the attack 
varieties in the recordset, we could 
see how commonly (or uncommonly) 
certain attacks were used. Shifting 
our attention to attack vectors or 
vulnerabilities helped us understand 95
 2024 DBIR AppendicesWe settled on a simple correlation 
between the VCDB data and the 
CIS Controls when we noticed how 
commonly certain asset classes 
were exploited in attacks. Because 
the CIS Controls safeguards are 
associated with asset classes and the 
VCDB shows the assets involved in 
each incident, we could tie the VCDB 
incidents to the CIS safeguards that 
would help prevent types of attacks. 
We were then able to bake that into 
our risk assessment method, CIS 
RAM,107 to help enterprises estimate the 
likelihood portion of their risk analysis. 
The more commonly an asset appeared 
in incident records, the more likely 
it would be the cause of an eventual 
incident, unless its corresponding 
safeguards were strong. This insight 
became our “Expectancy” score to 
automatically estimate risk likelihood.
These two diagrams illustrate that 
Expectancy correlation. Figure 88 
depicts a correlation between the 
commonality of an asset in the VCDB 
and the maturity of a CIS Controls 
safeguard that would protect that 
asset. A low asset commonality 
matched with a high maturity control 
would make the expectancy score low 
(in this illustration, ‘2’ out of ‘5’).
Figure 88.  Low asset commonality and 
high control maturity
Figure 89.  High asset commonality and 
low control maturityConversely, Figure 89 shows how a 
high Expectancy score would result 
from a high asset commonality and a 
low control maturity.The word “probability” is best suited 
for statistical analysis that results in a 
calculated percentage range or value 
within a time period (e.g. “between 
a 12% and 22% chance,” or “12% 
probability in a year”). “Likelihood” is 
typically used more colloquially or for 
less rigorous estimation processes 
(“very likely,” “not likely”, etc.) but still 
implies a time period or frequency.
The Expectancy score, however, does 
not consider a time frame. It says that 
we accept that an incident of some 
kind will occur, and that the higher the 
Expectancy score, the more we expect 
that asset and control to be involved. 
The lower the Expectancy score, the 
less we expect the asset and control to 
be involved.
This helps each enterprise prioritize the 
improvement of safeguards that could 
reduce risk the most.
Our correlation is not the only way 
that organizations can use the VCDB 
to estimate the likelihood of attacks. 
Even CIS and HALOCK use our own 
aggregations of the data given our 
different purposes. Consider how you 
would manage your cyber security 
program if you knew what attack 
methods were most common in your 
industry, or what attack methods 
correspond to what assets, or what 
was trending higher over time.
Take time to explore the VCDB for your 
risk analysis uses. You’ll be impressed 
with what you find.
The VERIS Community Database 
https://verisframework.org/vcdb.htmlIf we stated this correlation in plain 
language, we would say that the more 
commonly an asset is compromised, 
the more capable our controls for that 
asset should be.
But no risk analysis is complete without 
also considering the impact of an 
incident. CIS RAM uses additional 
methods to help enterprises estimate 
impact scores, so when paired with 
the Expectancy scores, they have 
evidence-based risk analysis. And in 
the spirit of the VCDB community, CIS 
RAM could freely provide that analysis 
to anyone who needs it.
Risk analysts might wonder about our 
use of the word “expectancy” rather 
than “likelihood” or “probability.” This 
was a careful choice driven by what the 
VCDB can tell us.
