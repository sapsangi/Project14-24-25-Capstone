1 Results in Brief
1.1 Executive Summary
Working Group 2A of the Communications, Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council
(CSRIC) is focused on addressing the Cyber Security Best Practices in the Communications
Industry. “Communications providers and users are under constant assault from a collection of
cyber criminals and others with even more malicious intent. While a large body of cyber
security best practices was previously created by the Network Reliability and Interoperability
Council (NRIC), many years have passed and the state-of-the-art in cyber security has advanced
rapidly. This Working Group will take a fresh look at cyber security best practices, including all
segments of the communications industry and public safety communities.”1
With the advances in the network and equipment , CSRIC Work Group 2A structured itself to
address Cyber Security Best Practices in five vertical (Wireless, IP Services, Network, People,
and Legacy Services) and four horizontal areas (Identity Management, Encryption, Vulnerability
Management, and Incident Response). It is no surprise with the changes in technology over the
past five years that 41% of the 397 Cyber Security Best Practices are new, 41% are modified
NRIC VII best practices, and only 18% of the NRIC VII best practices remained the same.
These Best Practices continue the theme stated more than ten years ago by the first NRIC: “The
Best practices, while not industry requirements or standards, are highly recommended. The First
Council stated, “Not every recommendation will be appropriate for every company in every
circumstance, but taken as a whole, the Council expects that these findings and
recommendations [when implemented} will sustain and continuously improve network
reliability.” 2
In light of the current state of urgency, Service Providers, Network Operators, and Equipment
suppliers are encouraged to prioritize their review of these Best Practices and prioritize their
timely, appropriate actions.
2 Introduction
The CSRIC was established as a Federal Advisory Committee designed to provide
recommendations to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding best practices
and actions the Commission can take to ensure optimal security, reliability, and interoperability
of communications systems, including telecommunications, media and public safety
communications systems. CSRIC created ten working groups, each with its own area of
responsibility. Working Group 2A was charged with taking a fresh look at cyber security best
practices across the communication industry.

Final Report
Malicious cyber activity is growing at an unprecedented rate, severely threatening the nation’s
public and private information infrastructure. In order to prepare for such attacks, it is
incumbent upon the organization to know what needs to be protected. Working Group 2A
began meeting in March 2010 to assess the Cyber Security Best Practices developed from NRIC
VI and VII. Sub-Teams were commissioned into the five vertical and four horizontal areas (as
mentioned above) to assess the NRIC Best Practices, eliminate obsolete or irrelevant best
practices, identify gaps, and write additional best practices that are relevant for today’s
technology and infrastructure. While the best practices describe commonly-accepted practices
and techniques to ensure the security of the network and systems, they are not overly
prescriptive, allowing network service providers, operators and equipment suppliers enough
latitude to make deployment decisions that best suit their business needs.
2.1 CSRIC Structure
2.2 Working Group 2A Team Members
Working Group 2A is comprised of thirty members, including its two Co-Chairs; Ed Amoroso
of AT&T and Phil Agcaoili of Cox Communications. Members come from a wide variety of

3 Objective, Scope, and Methodology
3.1 Objective
In its December 2004 report, Focus Group 2B of the NRIC VII Council recommended 187
Cyber Security Best Practices. These practices stem from a review and update of the existing
Best Practices from the NRIC VI Report from 2002 / 2003. For 2010 / 2011, CSRIC Working
Group 2A’s objective is to review the existing best practices with an eye toward modern
network principals; determine the gaps, and ensure a comprehensive set of best practices are
produced.
3.2 Scope
Problem Statement: Rapidly evolving and complex technologies in the communication
industry are increasingly under attack from insiders, hackers, cyber criminals, and nation-states
seeking economic advantage. Compromised technology or process controls can severely
impact a company’ brand and prowess impacting financials and shareholder value for many
years.

Final Report
Working Group Description: This Working Group will assess the existing best practices
within the industry by:
Analyzing existing NRIC, NIST, SANS, IEEE, etc. best practices related to Cyber
Security
Recommending modifications and deletions to those existing Best Practices
Identifying new Cyber Security Best Practices across existing and relatively new
technologies within the Communication industry.
Deliverables - Updated Cyber Security Best Practices reflective of the current technology
environment within the Communications’ Industry, and related references.
3.3 Methodology
3.3.1 Methodology Overview
Working Group 2A reviewed the 2005 NRIC VII Focus Group 2A recommendations for future
cyber security focus groups to consider. These included:3
1. Voice over IP. “The focus group believes that future voice telecommunications will
increasingly use this technology as network usage continues to converge between voice,
video and data. This will include not only landline and broadband voice transmission, but
also traditional wireless (e.g., cellular), voice, and data (e.g., wi-fi and WiMAX)
networks.
2. Identity Management. “The need to correctly establish the authenticity of devices,
humans and programs as they are used in network environments is becoming an
increasingly critical issue.”
3. Wireless security. “More and more endpoints in networking are migrating to a wireless
environment whether via voice wireless networking or data wireless networking.”
4. Blended attacks. “While basic definitions of what is a blended attack have been
completed, the work of creating appropriate Best Practices to help deal with potential
blended attacks is required.” Blended attacks seeks to maximize the severity of damage
by combining methods, for example using viruses and worms, while taking advantage of
vulnerabilities in computers or networks.
5. Messaging security. “More and more operational components of networks are being
managed by personnel who actively use various messaging products besides e-mail and
voice communications.”
6. Utility computing. “As telecommunications use increases, companies strive to improve
their computational delivery systems; there is a large push towards the use of utility
computing platforms (blade servers, networked storage, virtual network connectivity and
virtual security product implementations).”

7. Abuse Management. “In any area where technology is provided and where opportunists
will attempt to take advantage of consumers and providers, there is the potential for fraud
and abuse. While there are some Best Practices already provided that would start to help
with the abuse problem, a great deal of additional work needs to be done to address the
ever changing methods in which abuse and fraud are perpetrated on consumers and
network providers.”
8. Strategic outlook for Best Practices. “One area the focus group recognizes is that current
Best Practices are predominantly addressing operational networks and do not provide
guidance or focus towards overall strategic issues in cyber security.”
Overall, Working Group 2A used a matrix approach in tackling the Cyber Security Best
Practices for the Communication Industry. Utilizing the NRIC VII recommendations from
above and given the vast array of new and innovative technologies over the past ten years, the
group was divided into sub-groups to address the various functional areas. Groups met weekly
or bi-weekly, assigned sub-topics to subject matter experts, researched best practices across a
number of sources, evaluated the gaps to their existing environments, and developed
modifications or additions to the existing Best Practices. This resulted in a recommendation of
approximately 400 Cyber Security Best Practices.
3.3.2 Sub-Team Organization
Historically, Cyber Security Best Practices were heavily focused on network security. Working
Group 2A performed an analysis of the key areas across the Communication Industry and a
consensus was reach on nine key focus areas. These areas were divided into five key vertical
focus areas which encompassed Wireless, IP Services, Network, People and Legacy Services
and four key horizontal focus areas encompassing Identity Management, Encryption,
Vulnerability Management, and Incident Response. Each focus area was assigned a sub-team
lead based on expertise and interest. Additionally each working group member was asked to
participate on two focus areas. The focus teams began meeting either weekly or bi-weekly in
2Q10 and expeditiously agreed on sub-topics for the focus area and assigned sub-topics based
on expertise and interest.
The matrix below represents the five vertical focus areas. Team leads are highlighted. Team
members and subtopics are listed in the matrix.

3.3.3 Sub-Group Approach
In 2Q10, each focus group began meeting individually to discuss the scope of the sub-group to
determine the subjects to be addressed. If the area was covered in previous NRIC reports, the
members decided whether to include the subject in this year’s review. Additionally a gap
analysis was performed on the existing topics to set the focus for the new work not addressed by
the previous NRIC reports. Once each sub-topic was defined for the focus group, they were
assigned to the sub-team members. Subject matter experts, utilizing focus team meetings and
conference calls, examined existing Best Practices related to the focus areas and recommended
changes and new Best Practices for their team. The analysis included:
Elimination of obsolete or irrelevant Best Practices
Updating references to outdated materials or web sites
Identifying gaps and writing additional Best Practices
New Best Practices were vetted among the team at the meetings and through email. When the
sub-group had completed its analysis, the completed document was forwarded to the Working
Group Committee Lead. The Committee Lead combined all of the nine sub-group areas in to
one document and assessed the document for duplicates and proper placement within each of the
nine sub-teams. Recommendations were made to the Sub-team leads for moving or removing

Final Report
items. After an agreement via a conference bridge or email, the final CSRIC Cyber Security
Practices document was completed. It is attached as an appendix to this document.
4 Background
Security incidents from federal agencies are on the rise, increasing by over 400 percent from
fiscal years 2006 to 2009.4 The Poneman study reported “more than 83% of respondents believe
that the individuals affected by a data breach lost trust and confidence in the organization’s
ability to protect their personal information. These perceptions often result in the loss of
customer loyalty. In fact 80% of respondents in the PBI study reported that a certain percentage
of data breach victims terminated their relationships with the organization.”5
The importance of the communication infrastructure today is far-reaching to all aspects of our
every day life domestically and internationally. As a society, we are reliant on the backbone
communication “pipes” and wireless airwaves to get our information from “here” to “there”, for
purchasing items online, to “tweet” our everyday events, etc. However, malicious activity is
growing at an alarming rate and threatens the world’s public and private information
infrastructures. Cyber risk is widespread and we must look to mitigate this risk if we are to
maintain order and integrity. It is important to know where these threats are coming from and
how to protect the networks and systems that provide much of the information flowing
throughout the world today. What vulnerabilities make a device susceptible to an attack, fail, or
create instability? Are these threats from the outside the organization or from employees / other
internal people? How do we prepare to deal with a Cyber attack once it is already underway?
Interruptions to the networks and operations due to exploitation of these Cyber risks have
become a common occurrence. Service Providers, Network Operators, Equipment Suppliers,
and Government need to prepare for these situations and take action upon detection.
5 Analysis, Findings and Recommendations
5.1 Analysis
As discussed in Section 3, the Sub-Team Organization and Approach for Working Group 2A
was distributed into nine Sub-Teams to expand the focus from the prior Council. The teams
(in their first meeting) decided on the sub-topics that would be researched and analyzed by
the sub-groups. Past NRIC topics were included as well as new technologies that evolved
over the past five years. Each Working Group 2A sub-team decided within their team on the
sub-topics to pursue for research and analysis.

5.2 Findings
1. Wireless
Security Providers, Network Operators, and Equipment Suppliers play a key role in ensuring the
best practices (BP) are executed and met. Rapid changes in technology continue to evolve in the
Wireless space, for example, five years ago, cellular phones were mostly used for their original
design, making phone calls. With the introduction of “Smart” phones, a phone can perform as
many functions as a PC. Applications are abundant and can allow a user to perform many day to
day tasks, all from a device that fits into their pocket. The network continues to try to keep up
with the demands. Home “cell towers” are now available for areas experiencing difficulties in
receiving a signal and are now relatively inexpensive and available for the Consumer. With the
increase sophistication in equipment comes concerns with securing and tracking the smaller
devices, protecting the data, and preventing malware from infecting the devices. This is a key
focus area that will continue to evolve.
For 2011, the Wireless Sub-Team analyzed the various aspect of the Wireless Industry and
provided 47 new Best Practices (BPs) in this area, while modifying only 3 existing BPs and
leaving 2 NRIC VII BPs unchanged.
Page 12 of 24The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2A
March 2011
Final Report
2. IP Services
The IP Services area has grown dramatically over the past ten years. High speed broadband has
expanded rapidly to the home and small business. With the proliferation of so many IP enabled
devices, the industry needed to ensure the existence of an IP inventory for the future. Thus
Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPV6) deployment and integration into all faucets of the technical
environment is occurring on a rapid pace.
Voice over IP has also grown dramatically as most service providers offer reliable and integrated
products with their broadband and IP TV offerings. Additionally, the newest platform service
being offered under the title of “Cloud Computing” is quickly redefining the terms “network”
and “perimeter”. No longer is a company’s perimeter completely contained within the
company’s facilities. Web applications, data, etc. may be hosted by a multitude of vendors
around the world. This brings new definition to “perimeter security” where as application
security, Identity Management / Access Management, and Data Security become equally or
more important in protecting the integrity and privacy of companies customer information.
For 2011, the IP Services Sub-Team analyzed these critical items in the network, and provided
21 new Best Practices in this area, while modifying 7 existing BPs and leaving 2 NRIC VII BPs
unchanged.
3. Network
The existing NRIC Best Practices were heavily focused on the network and network components
(Network Elements, Element Managers, etc.) and lacking is the view of portable data and the
leakage of data as a result of lost, misplaced or abandoned sources of sensitive data.
The existing NRIC Best Practices are valid and should remain in effect, however with the
proliferation of the above mentioned portable devices new best practices have been identified
and should become a part of the CSRIC Best Practices documentation.
For 2011, the Network Sub-Team analyzed these critical items in the network, and provided 23
new Best Practices in this area, while modifying 66 existing BPs and leaving 32 NRIC VII BPs
unchanged.
4. People
The People Sub-Team began their analysis by reviewing the best practices as documented in the
various NRIC reports, identifying new or additional best practices, and identifying best practices
that are no longer applicable. The People Sub-team distributed their work across five focus
areas:
Page 13 of 24The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2A
March 2011
Final Report
Awareness – This area addresses the need for awareness to the components of cyber security for
the enterprise, the employee and the customer.
SPAM – This area addresses the impact of spam on the ability of a network to perform at
acceptable levels and identifies best practices for preventing network harm as a result of a spam.
Social Engineering – This area addresses the impacts of social engineering and how to prevent
or minimize social engineering as a component of an attack on a network.
Data Loss/Data Leakage – This area addresses the issues and best practices associate with both
data loss (normally from an external source) and data leakage (normally from an internal source)
and the implications this has on cyber security.
Phishing – This area addresses the issues and best practices associated with Phishing. Phishing
is the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information (i.e.
usernames, passwords and credit card details) by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an
electronic communication.
For 2011, the People Sub-Team analyzed these critical items, and provided 20 new Best
Practices in this area, while modifying 9 existing BPs and leaving 7 NRIC VII BPs unchanged.
5. Legacy Sub-Group
The Working Group 2A Legacy Sub-team reviewed the terminology related to in-scope Best
Practices related to signaling, protocol, interoperability and security. It was clear that existing
Best Practices that specifically documented SS7 network access control, authentication, DoS
protection, network design, and link diversity should be modernized. With next generation
signaling networks now being deployed, the need to provide industry Best Practices that provide
convergence for legacy and next generation platforms was evident.
Media gateways (MG) were also reviewed. MG’s perform translation functions between
unrelated telecommunications networks such as the Public Switched Telephone Network
(PSTN), Signaling System Seven (SS7), Voice-over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and provide
control and signaling functions. VoIP to TDM media gateways covert TDM voice to a media
streaming protocol. The Working Group 2A Legacy Sub-Team reviewed existing Best Practices
related to Media Gateways for relevancy and long term evolution potential.
Lawfully Authorized Electronic Surveillance (LAES) Best Practices were also reviewed. Since
the single existing Best Practice was created, the terminology has been updated to
Communication Assisted Law Enforcement (CALEA). The Sub-Team recommended that the
existing Best Practice be deleted and replaced with four new Best Practices developed to
specifically address the CALEA issue.
Additionally Signal Control Points was reviewed and existing BPs were deleted and replaced
with new proposed Best Practices that more appropriately addresses current industry practices.
Page 14 of 24The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2A
March 2011
Final Report
For 2011, the Legacy Sub-team analyzed these critical items in the network, and provided 21
new Best Practices in this area, while modifying 7 existing BPs.
6. Identity Management
IdM functions and capabilities are used to increase confidence in identity information of an
entity and support business and security applications (e.g., access control and authorization)
including identity-based services. An entity is considered to be something that has separate and
distinct existence and that can be identified in a context. In the context of IdM, examples of
entities include subscribers, users, network elements, networks, software applications, services
and devices.
In regards IdM standardization activities there are various level of maturity. Specifically, there
are some standards specifications that are completed and there is a wide range of work that is
still ongoing and still not matured. The approach taken is to focus on standards specifications
that are currently available.
For 2011, the Identity Mgmt Sub-Team analyzed these critical items, and provided 8 new Best
Practices in this area, while modifying 12 existing BPs and leaving 9 NRIC VII BPs unchanged.
7. Encryption
Because encryption plays a central role in cyber security, it is a logical topic for research,
analysis and discussion in the work of CSRIC Working Group 2A. While it was relatively easy
to identify those best practices developed during Network Reliability and Interoperability
Council (NRIC) VII which address encryption and crypto-authentication, developing new best
practices relating to encryption posed a greater challenge. The new candidate best practices
address cloud computing, of growing importance and not addressed five years ago.
The challenge with the so-called “legacy” best practices dating back to NRIC VII was primarily
to determine first whether they remained relevant and next to determine whether the references
had been updated or supplemented. A related step involved determining whether certain best
practices were more appropriately grouped with another sub-team’s work and vice versa.
For the new best practices, Encryption sub-team members identified topics that heretofore had
not been described or presented as best practices. For 2011, the Encryption Sub-Team analyzed
these critical items in the network, and provided 8 new Best Practices in this area, while
modifying 7 existing BPs and leaving 4 NRIC VII BPs unchanged.
Page 15 of 24The Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council Working Group 2A
March 2011
Final Report
8. Vulnerability Management
Vulnerability Management continues to be a very challenging area due to the proliferation of
zero-day exploitation of vulnerabilities, extensive malware infections from websites and spam
mail and the general availability of Botnet tool kit targeted to “entry-level” hackers from the
sophisticated attackers. Desktop / server security tools are ineffective in the battle to stop the
spread of the malicious code. Zero day exploitation of the vulnerabilities leaves little to no time
to address the multitude of patches that must be applied across the various platforms. This
leaves service providers prioritizing only the high risk vulnerability exposures.
For 2011, the Vulnerability Sub-Team analyzed these critical items in the network, and provided
9 new Best Practices in this area, while modifying 15 existing BPs and leaving 9 NRIC VII BPs
unchanged.
9. Incident Response
All organizations face interruptions to normal business processes. Assembly lines break down
and the product stops moving from stage to stage. Machinery fails, supplies are late, documents
are lost, whatever can happen, will eventually happen. Those organizations that rely on
information technology (IT) systems face disruptions specific to information transmission,
storage, and processing. The one challenge all organizations face is how to determine the cost of
these interruptions. The ability to accurately forecast and budget for outages caused by security
breaches continues to be a much desired business tool that has grown in importance as the
reliance on information technology systems has grown. Also, the possible impact of data
breaches continues to grow.
Most American businesses are not prepared to identify and quantify financial losses incurred
during cyber events – nor are they properly structured to manage cyber security risk in general6.
It would be impossible to foresee every possibility and therefore develop a formula that covers
all events.
For 2011, the Incident Response Sub-Team analyzed these critical items in the network, and
provided 7 new Best Practices in this area, while modifying 35 existing best practices and
leaving 7 NRIC VII BPs unchanged.
5.3 Recommendations
CSRIC Working Group 2A recommends the attached set of 397 Best Practices across 9 focus
areas (Wireless, IP Services, Network, People, Legacy services, Identity Management,
Encryption, Vulnerability Management, and Incident Management) to the FCC for consideration
of adopting the best practices for general use by industry. As threats become increasingly

March 2011
Final Report
complex and persistent, network service providers, operators, and equipment suppliers must
work together with increased diligence to secure the network infrastructure.
For future consideration, CSRIC Working Group 2A is recommends continuing research and
discussion around the following areas:
Service Provider Network Protection
Malicious activity is growing at an alarming rate, threatening commercial and consumer
networks and systems. Home users are particularly vulnerable because of a lack of knowledge
about the threats and the tools that can help keep them safe on the internet. Trojans, Botnets,
viruses, etc. continue to plague many of these devices and re-infecting them and other devices
that communicate with the infected hosts. These devices normally connect to the internet via an
Internet Service Provider (ISP). Therefore ISPs are aware of the infections and the type of
malware circulating around the internet. The CSRIC Working Group 2A recommends that,
where appropriate and possible, ISPs should detect and attempt to stop malware from traversing
the internet while providing self help to the consumers who are infected from the malware.
Working Group 8 examined this area and made recommendations for Best Practices. Working
Group 2A believes this subject needs additional analysis since it is constantly evolving and
recommends a new group should be formed with industry subject matter experts in malware
detection, and remediation to assess other ideas and recommendations (such as a central clearing
house for Blacklisted URLs).
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Recommendation
Several of the best practices mention or make reference to BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).
This protocol, developed initially in June of 1989 with the publishing of RFC 1105, A Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP), set in motion the practices through which IP networks interconnect
and set the stage to become the Internet's exterior routing protocol of the future. There are 4
major revisions of BGP. BGPv1 (RFC 1105) BGPv2 (RFC 1162, June 1990) BGPv3 (RFC
1267 October 1991) and the final version of BGP 4 (RFC 1771, March of 1995). BGP’s
primary function is the exchange of network reachability information between networks (called
autonomous systems), to allow each AS on an internetwork to send messages efficiently to every
other interconnected network. Most (if not all) public IP space is interconnected with BGP. It
is our recommendation that a new sub-group be formed with industry subject matter experts in
BGP and inter-networking to formally address the needs of this vital part of our infrastructure.
IP Television / Video on Demand
Several Service Providers have begun offering services through which internet television
services are delivered using the architecture and networking methods of the Internet Protocol
Suite over a packet-switched network infrastructure. IPTV is distinguished from general
internet-based or web-based multimedia services by its on-going standardization process and
preferential deployment scenarios in subscriber-based telecommunications networks with high-
speed access channels into end-user premises via set-top boxes or other customer-premises

Final Report
equipment7. Video on Demand allows users to select and watch video or audio content on
demand. Working Group 2A recommends future Councils analyze Best Practices in these areas
as they mature in the coming years.
6 Conclusions
The CSRIC Working Group 2A spent more than nine months researching, analyzing, and
evaluating Cyber Security Best Practices. During this time members participated in dozens of
conference calls, met in various cities, identified gaps, and researched new Best Practices, plus
dedicated countless hours editing and revising the final report.
In conclusion, members feel this Final Report is a fair and accurate representation of their
collective view-points and perspectives and hopes this will help to improve Cyber Security
through these Best Practices.

INTRODUCTION
All organizations face interruptions to normal business processes. Assembly lines break down
and the product stops moving from stage to stage. Machinery fails, supplies are late,
documents are lost, whatever can happen, will eventually happen. Those organizations that rely
on information technology (IT) systems face disruptions specific to information transmission,
storage, and processing. The one challenge all organizations face is how to determine the cost
of these interruptions. The ability to accurately forecast and budget for outages caused by
security breaches continues to be a much desired business tool that has grown in importance as
the reliance on information technology systems has grown. Also, the possible impact of data
breaches continues to grow.
The results of a Ponemon study on the cost of privacy breaches provides further evidence of
the importance of having a good quality incident response plan in place1. According to the
study, “More than 83% of respondents believe that the individuals affected by the data breach
lost trust and confidence in their organization’s ability to protect their personal information. As
we have found in our consumer studies on trust, these perceptions often result in the loss of
customer loyalty. In fact, 80% of respondents in the PBI study reported that a certain
percentage of data breach victims terminated their relationship with the organization.”
In a more recent Ponemon Institute study2, the cost of a data breach increased last year to
$204 per compromised customer record. Also, the average total cost of a data breach rose from
$6.65 million in 2008 to $6.75 million in 2009. A critical aspect of this study revealed that the
management skills of the CISO, or an individual in an equivalent position, seemed to help hold
down the cost of a data breach: The average per capita cost of an incident was $157 per record
for companies with a CISO, versus $236 for companies without one. This brings up two
important questions that businesses need the answers to in order to plan for the cost of these
types of outages. What methodology can be followed to help management make informed
decisions? What factors influence the final costs, both increasing costs and decreasing them?

Most American businesses are not prepared to identify and quantify financial losses incurred
during cyber events – nor are they properly structured to manage cybersecurity risk in general3.
A goal of this document is to discuss strategies to aid in creation of a methodology for dealing
with interruptions so that normal activity returns as quickly as possible and costs are managed
as required. It would be impossible to foresee every possibility and therefore develop a formula
that covers all events. The discussion, then, should be around the general strategy used for
managing interruptions. This general approach for Incident Response can best be seen in the
following figure4:
Step 1 : PREPARATION
Step 2: IDENTIFICATION
Step 3: CONTAINMENT
Step 4: ERADICATION
Step 5: RECOVERY
Step 6: LESSONS LEARNED

5CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
BEFORE YOU CAN PLAN YOU HAVE TO KNOW
Malicious cyber activity is growing at an unprecedented rate, severely threatening the nation's
public and private information infrastructure. In order to prepare for such attacks, it is
incumbent upon the organization to know what needs to be protected. Cyber-risk has become
so widespread that governments are taking unprecedented steps to prevent possible insertion
of malware into their telecommunications and information technology goods procured from
outside sources. To that end, organizations need to have a plan to deal with the inevitable
cyber-attack or incident.
Identify and Categorize Assets
The first step in preparing for an interruption is to identify those systems, resources, and
processes that comprise the core of an organization’s ability to sustain productivity and meet
obligations. In other words, what can we absolutely not go on without? This is more than just
an inventory process. It is extended by categorizing these resources so that a relative
comparison can be made between multiple critical resources when conflicting and opposing
demands arise. For example, a telecom business unit could identify two applications, app1 and
app2, as being absolutely critical to its business objectives. During a serious interruption,
management directs that these two applications be the first things restored, but there are not
resources (system administrators, hardware, etc) enough to work on both applications at the
same time. Which should receive priority? It would be better to have made this decision before
the crisis rather than during the crisis.
Identify Threats
When looking to mitigate risks, it is important to know where threats are coming from. Once
the critical assets have been identified and categorized, the next step is to evaluate what are
the potential threats to these critical assets. What vulnerabilities in the assets make them
susceptible to attack, failure or instability? Are these threats from the outside (external) or
from employees or other internal people? Information like this can be invaluable in helping
security officers and managers understand where risks may lie within their organizational
infrastructure. Knowing that a possibility exists that an interruption to their delivery service
could occur, managers can prepare for that situation and take action upon its detection. Not
6CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
only does this give security managers insight into where threats may come from, it helps them
to prioritize which assets should be protected more than other organizational assets. These
critical assets are identified for the purpose of lowering overall risk to the business or
operation.
Threats are either malicious (intended to do harm, cause loss of income, value, reputation, etc)
or non-malicious (accidents, equipment failures, misconfigurations causing outages). Some
interruptions are non-malicious in that the person who introduces the threat into the
organization did so by accident even if the originator of the threat meant it for mischief. An
example would be the user who brought a virus or worm into the network. This user didn’t
intend to cause harm but the result might be just that.
What is the Risk to the Organization?
Risk related to the operation and use of information systems is another component of
organizational risk that senior leaders must address as a routine part of their ongoing risk
management responsibilities5. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130,
Appendix III, describes adequate security as security commensurate with risk. This risk includes
both the likelihood and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized
access to or modification of information. With the list of critical assets identified and an analysis
of the threats against them, the user can begin to put some numbers down that represent the
risk to the organization. In business, risk can be expressed as a dollar figure that represents the
realistic cost due to the loss or interruption of an asset because of a specific threat. In other
words, RISK = (Value of an asset * likelihood of a threat). If the value of the asset is high and the
likelihood of a threat is high then the risk is high. As with assets, the conceivable list of threats
should be ordered beginning with the most severe. This list should include all “likely” threats to
all critical resources.

NIST, April 2008, pp 10. Retrieved 28 May 2010, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html .
7CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
Mitigating controls are those technologies and processes that limit or lessen the impact of a
potential threat. For example, in the case where a user brings a virus into the network, a
mitigating control might include anti-virus software on the network. As with assets and threats,
a list of mitigating controls should be considered when determining the overall risk posture of
the organization. Accordingly, “Organizations should ensure that there is close cooperation and
collaboration among personnel responsible for the design, development, implementation,
operation, and disposition of information systems and the information security professionals
advising the senior leadership on appropriate security controls needed to adequately mitigate
risk and protect critical mission/business processes.6”
Develop a Plan
The natural outcome of the proceeding steps is to develop a plan to address likely situations.
How should the organization respond when X occurs? What are the steps to be followed when
Z happens and so on? What are the teams, processes, chain of command, service level
agreements and so on that will help manage interruptions to assets. This is the type of incident
response planning that helps organizations respond quickly and efficiently to potential
interruptions. The plan, sometimes referred to as a protection strategy, should not be so broad
as to have minimal guidance during real events or so narrow that it cannot provide the latitude
to respond to specifics. To help protect organizations from the adverse effects of ongoing,
serious, and increasingly sophisticated threats to information systems, organizations should
employ a risk-based protection strategy7. Risk-based protection strategies are characterized by
identifying, understanding, mitigating as appropriate, and explicitly accepting the residual risks
associated with the operation and use of information systems8. A framework is clearly needed
where many common questions would have previously been considered when not in the heat
of the outage and pre-agreed upon decisions are offered as guidance to be considered in the
event of a real event. Risk-based protection strategies are necessary to help ensure that
organizations are adequately protected against the growing sophistication of threats to
information systems. The serious nature of the threats, along with the dynamic environment in
which modern organizations operate, demand flexible, scalable, and mobile defenses that can
be tailored to rapidly changing conditions including the emergence of new threats,
vulnerabilities, and technologies9. The first and foremost step in handling any incident is to be

3.4 Authority
4. Policies
4.1 Types of Incidents and Level of Support
Our organization is authorized to address all types of computer security incidents which
occur, or threaten to occur, in our Constituency (see 3.2) and which require cross-
organizational coordination. The level of support given will vary depending on the type and
severity of the incident or issue, the type of constituent, the size of the user community
affected, and available resources at the time. Special attention will be given to issues affecting
critical infrastructure. We are committed to keeping our constituency informed of potential
vulnerabilities, and where possible, will inform this community of such vulnerabilities before
they are actively exploited.
4.2 Co-operation, Interaction and Disclosure of Information
We will cooperate with other organizations in the course of the IR process. This
Cooperation also includes and often requires the exchange of vital information regarding
security incidents and vulnerabilities. Nevertheless we will protect the privacy of customers,
and therefore (under normal circumstances) pass on information in an anonymized way only
unless other contractual agreements apply. We operate under the restrictions imposed by
applicable law. This involves careful handling of personal data as required by jurisdiction, but it
is also possible that we may be forced to disclose information due to a Court's order.
4.3 Communication and Authentication
For normal communication not containing sensitive information we will use
conventional methods like unencrypted e-mail or fax. For secure communication PGP-
Encrypted e-mail or telephone will be used. If it is necessary to authenticate a person before
communicating, this can be done either through existing webs of trust (e.g. FIRST, TI, …) or by
other methods like call-back, mail-back or even face-to-face meeting if necessary.

Preparation
Preparation is one of the most important parts of the incident response process. Proper
planning will provide the framework on which the incident handling team will operate and
facilitate the “Command and Control” role during subsequent phases. The important
preparation items are described in the following sections.
Setting an Organizational Policy for Incident Response
An Incident Response Policy should be documented which clearly states who is
responsible for responding to an incident and setting the tone for the expectations of senior
leadership. This policy should govern the general response, documentation and reporting of
incidents affecting computerized and electronic communication resources, such as theft,
intrusion, misuse of data, other activities contrary to an Acceptable Use Policy, denial of
service, corruption of software, computer, and electronic communication-based HIPAA
violations, and incidents reported by other institutions and business entities.
You need to establish a Security Incident Response Policy to protect the integrity,
availability and confidentiality of confidential or proprietary information, including ePHI to
prevent loss of service and to comply with legal requirements. This policy establishes the
coordination of the organization’s response to computerized and electronic communication
systems incidents to enable quicker remediation, information gathering and reporting of
infrastructure affecting security related events.
Develop and Formalize Incident Handling Instructions
Incident handling instructions are documents used by the incident handling team while
they are about to begin the analysis or in the middle of the incident. The instructions act as a
good resource for the team as most of the important aspects are present in the instruction
manual. Because when the instruction manual is being prepared, the thought process is at its
13CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
best and chances are that most of the instructions are present in the document minimizing ad-
hoc decision making during the incident. The key elements which help in preparing the
instructions include Key Players which are discussed in the section below.
Contacts with Incident Handling Participants
The main part of the initial response is communicating with the right people and having
a focal team lead or facilitate the Incident Handling process. There should be range of contacts
to call upon, as needed, during the various stages of the response. The contacts should include
Human Resources, Corporate Legal, Corporate Communications and a variety of technical
groups (i.e., network, system and database administrators, etc.). These key players should be
able to provide details like logs from firewalls, systems, routers and switches. These logs reveal
a substantial amount of information which could possibly lead to the attacker or in the
direction of making a conclusion.
Create an Incident Response Kit
Using a combination of various tools, it helps to follow up with an incident in a
formalized manner. The importance and purpose of all the available tools should be well known
in advance. Just like doctor’s who carry a medical bag, the Incident Handling response team
should have a set of tools or a kit available to them prior to an incident occurring.
TOOL (S) PURPOSE
Response Kit The response kit serves the purpose of containing all of the software, network and peripherals cables all in one place so
that at the time of a real incident no item or tool is missed.
Forensics and Various tools are available in market for handling evidence in a secure manner, capturing volatile data like running
Imaging processes.
Intrusion The IDS monitoring software serves as the window for viewing any possible signs of further attempted intrusion. The
Detection tools host based IDS (for end point protection) and network based IDS (network level protection) serve the purpose of
(IDS) viewing any signs of malicious activity.
Vulnerability The assessment tools should be in place so that after putting systems back online, they can be tested for any signs of
assessment future attacks. This ensures newly deployed systems are free from any vulnerabilities and helps in discovering any
possible threats. It is important to ensure that all protection layers or key configuration controls of the system are
reviewed (i.e., application, web, operating system, network ACL or firewall rules, etc.).
The SANS investigative toolkit is one example of a good resource10. The kit includes:

Network Cables (crossover & straight through);
HUB’s;
Anti-static bags for evidence;
Blank CD’s for burning software from response laptop;
Call list;
Forensics software;
Imaging software;
A Laptop installed with the aforementioned software;
Notebook with pen/pencil.
Incident checklist and communication plan
The primary incident response handlers should always carry incident checklist with
them. Since it is a very stressful work, chances are that some important steps will be missed.
So in order to avoid that situation, a checklist should be maintained. The communication plan
should also be sound which should clearly describe, in what events the process should be
escalated to other incident handlers. One of the members in the team should be charged with
primary communicator to both management and within the team. This also keeps the
management up to date with the latest developments. Any communication to external entities
including media should be channeled through Legal and the Corporate Communications team.
Threat Modeling
For all anticipated types of attacks or security issues, a clear method of assessing the
risks to the business should be available. This is the criteria used to make a decision on how
impactful the issue is to the business (i.e., critical, high, medium, low risk, etc.). The priority
given to the response will derive by the severity of the tag given to it.
Identify and Designate an Incident Response Team
There should be a team of individuals that are considered the focal point for handling
any kind of incident which an organization might encounter. The skills of the individuals should
be of prime consideration and should span many disciplines throughout the organization.
Because the process of incident handling can be very stressful, the incident response team
should have certain skill sets; in particular, they should be technically sound, having good
15CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
organizational and inter-personal skills. And it is always good that someone from the team
knows various languages since there is a possibility of organization having offices in various
geographical locations. The whole team should be diplomatic in nature because there are
times when compromises need to be made and someone who can negotiate would be an
added advantage.
Interruption Cost Considerations
All assets have value – intrinsic value, (the cost to acquire or produce it) and potential value
(what money the asset can yield). If the organization is denied the asset, then the value of the
loss can be based on the intrinsic value plus the potential value lost during the time the asset is
denied. Various types of costs need to be understood before we can place value on an asset.
1. Lost asset costs – any time an organization loses an asset, especially an asset that is in
production use, that loss costs money. Loss quantification can vary greatly depending
on the type of business and the type of outage.
2. Loss of business income while the asset is unavailable – for example, if an organization
that provides digital media services loses a device because of a cyber attack, a lightning
strike, or a fire, that loss creates an outage that, in turn, will create customer
dissatisfaction and possibly even a direct loss of revenue. If orders for pay per view
services cannot be processed, there is direct loss of revenue. In this example, the
organization may have to compare the number of orders that occurred during a
previous time frame with the number of orders that could have occurred during the
outage in order to quantify the loss.
3. Recovery costs (efforts to bring the asset back on line at least temporarily) – in the face
of a cyber attack, many organizations take the approach of putting all hands on deck to
put out the fire. The rationale for this, of course, is the more help you have solving the
problem, the quicker it will be solved. With a cyber-attack, unfortunately, this is rarely
the case. Responding to cyber attacks successfully requires a great deal of preventive
measures be taken in order to properly mitigate the threat. The preventative costs that
an organization would bear before an attack will almost always outweigh the “all hands”
approach costs that are incurred after an attack.
a. Alternative providers – when faced with outages, some organizations have taken
preventative measures to have their services fall-back to outsource providers in
order to avoid any interruption in business operations. Depending on the nature
of the business, this may or may not be a suitable alternative. Each organization
16CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
has to weigh the costs of outsourced services against the costs of bearing the
brunt of the cyber-attack. Even in the face of a cyber attack, where alternate
providers are used, the affected organization still has to deal with cleaning up
the effects of the cyber-attack. No organization walks away from a cyber-attack
unscathed and certainly not without incurring unexpected, additional,
unwelcome costs.
b. Temporary systems – the use of temporary systems as a substitute for those
systems taken offline during the course of the cyber-attack is common practice.
If a server goes down in today’s modern operations environment, it can be taken
offline and replaced with a virtual machine within a matter of a few minutes.
More and more, organizations are relying on virtual instances to circumvent
cyber attack scenarios. They are cost effective and relatively easy to implement.
Using virtual instances helps reduce cost and lower risk when a cyber attack
occurs.
c. Additional staff or facilities – in organizations where customer-facing activities
are considered high volume operations, it is not uncommon to have staff
identified on standby in case of an emergency. In the event of a cyber threat
manifesting itself, often these staff members are called into action. When that
happens, it costs an organization additional money in the form of resources
(direct cost) and support for all those resources (indirect cost).
4. Remediation costs – often, the first measures taken by an organization are temporary
measures. They are considered as band aids use to stop the bleeding until a more
permanent solution is found. Sometimes this requires the purchase of additional
equipment, bringing on additional resources with adequate skill sets to help solve the
problem, or other measures as determined by the organization. Each of these
additional steps of course cost more money to the organization.
5. Legal or contractual penalties - Where laws are typically tied to a state or region, cyber
transactions occur in a realm without fixed borders, where information travels at the
click of a mouse. No company is immune to the application of territorial laws to business
conducted through Internet.
6. Brand damage or increased marketing costs due to interruption are another concern.
How an organization communicates problems to the public often is the determining
factor in their future success. The damage a cyber attack can cause to any brand should
never be underestimated and the expense organizations have to incur in order to
publicize and protect that brand can quickly become very large numbers. Many large
organizations have seen their market value drop dramatically when they have suffered
through a cyber attack. Any misstep in communication or in the incident response
process can have long lasting negative effects.
17CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
It is important to point out that there is no magic in the paragraphs above. This is a standard
risk-based approach to evaluating any situation. It is accurate to say that this process helps
managers understand what truly is critical in their environment, to understand how it could be
interrupted (at least the likely vectors) and, if it happens, what are the first steps in recovering
from the situation. It has been suggested that without sufficient planning the costs will be
much higher. There is one line of thought that contends 80% of companies that have no
business continuity plan will fail within 18 months of a serious interruption to business. Some
people claim this is over inflated but even so, the numbers are significant, ranging from 20-40%.
But even if the company doesn’t fail, the costs are always going to be higher and the losses
greater without appropriate planning. As an example, let’s consider the following situation.
Some event is detected that makes operators suspicious. This event might be detected by a
user report or by a technical system alert. In any case something is wrong and warrants further
investigation. Typically, the investigation is simply answering a series of questions, similar to
those shown below.
Troubleshooting Questions
What are the symptoms of the problem?
How extensive is the problem (scope – areas of impact)?
Is it still active?
Are we being attacked currently or is it just cleanup at this point?
Can the problem be fixed immediately or are there viable work-a-rounds?
Is there a permanent fix?
Is it malicious?
The extent of the cost will depend upon the answers provided to the questions shown above.
This is where prior planning pays its first great dividend. If the right response plan is in place,
damage and loss to the asset can be effectively minimized. The quicker the response to the
event the more likely the damage (and overall cost to the organization) will be lower. Most
organizations try to adhere to some industry standards for network protection these days.
Guidelines like ISO 27002 or NIST 800-53 and COBIT are frequently cited as baseline references
for security. Because of the diverse nature of enterprise operations, it is difficult and often
impossible to assume that every operation is going to perform incident response in the same
manner.
18CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
Cost Considerations
In considering the types of costs used to calculate losses during any given stage of an incident
response process, we need to look at direct costs, indirect costs and consequential costs. The
direct costs we refer to herein include such things as the burdened cost of labor, equipment
repair or replacement, etc. Indirect costs (referred to above as Interruption Costs) that we
consider include organizational downtime factors such as loss of productivity, inability to
sustain or continue operations, loss of sales, etc. Consequential costs are costs that are
incurred after the incident has been resolved and are directly attributed to the incident itself.
This may include an increase in customer churn, refusal to conclude a purchasing process,
cancellation of services, the cost of defense against future litigation, etc.
One overlooked truth is that downtime costs accelerate in a non-linear fashion every hour. If a
system fails for five minutes, the costs are fairly low because manual methods (paper and
pencil) of making records or communicating by telephone instead of e-mails can suffice to
conduct business. Over an extended period, however, the volume of work overwhelms the
manual processes. Yet some businesses cannot run at all on manual processes. Business and
financial operations increasingly deteriorate, and the rate of dollar loss grows — sometimes to
the point of fatally damaging the business. In addition, when assessing the financial impact of
downtime, it is necessary to consider factors such as potential lost revenue, reductions in
worker productivity and damaged market reputation. In some cases, downtime can even
reduce shareholder confidence, which can create unnecessary and unplanned costs. Financial
analysts and accountants at the company can help come up with the list of relevant factors that
are most affected by downtime and contribute most to its costs11.
WHEN AWARENESS OF A CYBER-INCIDENT OCCURS
Investigate the event in order to determine if it is malicious or non-malicious in origin (i.e.,
worm vs. configuration error or HW failure). In most organizations, the investigation begins
after someone has reported a problem or a problem with network performance has been
detected. Regardless of the manner in which an event is reported, it must be investigated. One
of the first things that the investigating team needs to determine is an answer to the question
11 Toigo, Jon William, ”Disaster Recovery Planning: 3rd Ed.”, Princeton, NJ, Prentice Hall PTR, 2003.
19CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
“How bad is it?”, generally followed with an inquiry like “How long will it take to fix it?” At this
point in the incident response process, any guess as to how long it will take to fix it is just that --
a guess! The well-trained security specialist can quickly determine whether or not an event is a
nuisance or a malicious threat to the organization. In either case, calculating costs at this point
simply comes down to time and money.
Time and money in this case equate to direct labor costs. Most of the steps that occur in
determining what type of events you’re dealing with and how bad the event is will almost
always equate to direct labor costs. Having said that, one of the key factors to consider here is
“the person tracking costs must know when to begin accurately tracking the number of
personnel that get involved in this incident as well as how to track the number of hours that
they contribute to solving the problem.” In order for any level of accuracy to be taken seriously
in calculating the cost of an incident, the person placed in charge of mitigating the events
should know or be briefed on the importance of tracking the level of effort (i.e., man hours)
used to resolve the issue. The most difficult part here is to look beyond the work being
performed by the cyber security incident response team and account for efforts contributed by
other department personnel towards resolving the cyber-incident or responding to the effects
of the cyber-incident. For example, while the CSIRT may be performing work, IT personnel may
be performing tasks such as network isolation, patch level reviews, or a myriad of other
activities in order to respond to the incident. People in the marketing department may be
coordinating with public relations teams and trying to put a positive spin on the incident or
creating a press release to explain to the public what has happened. If the cyber security
incident involved privacy data, the problem becomes even greater. Many states require
notification processes be started immediately upon the detection of a cyber security incident
that could result in the compromise of privacy data.
This is a dreaded situation for most companies because it forces them to go public with the
issue and to take steps to mitigate any losses as a result of the compromised data being
mishandled, misused or made public. This often results in lawsuits and general condemnation
from the public. While it may be an overreaction, the effects are real and have devastating
impact in the stock market. When one begins to consider all of the aforementioned, it is little
wonder that many large corporations set up a war room to handle cyber security incidents as
soon as they begin. In today’s business environment, companies cannot afford to overlook
anything that impacts their bottom line. The problems are not limited specifically to
20CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
corporations. Unfortunately, very few have meaningful or reliable metrics for their security
controls. According to Sam Merrell at CERT, “What gets measured gets managed.12”
Many government agencies have been the victim of cyber attacks and have handled the
situation poorly. Frequently, the urge to keep this situation quiet is the worst thing that could
be done. Many times, managers fall victim to the temptation to try and solve the problem
internally without letting it become a public matter of record. What happens more often than
not is that an internal leak upsets their plans and they now have two disasters to fight – the
cyber security disaster and a public relations disaster. For this reason, it is recommended the
companies develop strict guidelines, metrics, and policies that deal with how their managers,
executives, and employees react during the course of a cyber security incident. These
guidelines and policies should become a part of a disaster recovery and business continuity plan
that is periodically rehearsed. Numerous studies have shown that companies that fail to
prepare for a disaster generally perform poorly in a disaster situation. Furthermore, that poor
performance almost always leads to increased costs to the company. Lack of planning, lack of
training and, most importantly, lack of preparedness are all compounding factors that make a
bad situation even worse.
REPORTING AN INCIDENT
A computer incident within the federal government as defined by NIST Special Publication 800-
61 is a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use
policies, or standard computer security practices. Reports of computer incidents should include
a description of the incident or event, using the appropriate taxonomy, and as much of the
following information as possible; however, reporting should not be delayed in order to gain
additional information.
According to the Federal Incident Reporting Guidelines, the minimum information to include in
a report (to CERT) is as follows:

Resolution
It is recommended that all incident response teams should utilize this schema when reporting
incidents to the US-CERT. Depending upon the criticality of an incident; it is not always feasible
to gather all the information prior to reporting it. In this case, incident response teams should
continue to report information as it is collected.
Federal Agency Incident Categories
In order to clearly communicate incidents and events (any observable occurrence in a network
or system) throughout the Federal Government and supported organizations, it is necessary for
the government incident response teams to adopt a common set of terms and relationships
between those terms. All elements of the federal government should use a common taxonomy.
Below please find a high level set of concepts and descriptions to enable improved
communications among and between agencies. The taxonomy below does not replace
discipline (technical, operational, intelligence) that needs to occur to defend federal agency
computers/networks, but provides a common platform to execute the US-CERT mission. US-
CERT and the federal civilian agencies are to utilize the following incident and event categories
and reporting timeframe criteria as the federal agency reporting taxonomy.

DETERMINING THE TYPE OF CYBER-INCIDENT
Computer crime encompasses a broad range of potentially illegal activities. Generally, however,
it may be divided into one of two types of categories:
1) Crimes that target computer networks or devices directly; and
23CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
2) Crimes facilitated by computer networks or devices, the primary target of which is
independent of the computer network or device.
Table 3 shown on the following page discusses the various types of cyber attacks that an
organization may encounter. The GAO analysis of data from government and industry reports13
accumulated and compiled this data over the last decade, so it should be no surprise to security
experts and managers. Regardless of which of the two categories a cyber-attack falls under, the
organization must deal with the incident properly. How the organization deals with it is a very
large contributing factor into how much that incident will cost in the long run. Studies show a
strong correlation between markets for cybercrime and security – as crime increases, so does
the market for security mitigation14 and “without any specific policy intervention, the
interaction between the two markets may resemble an arms race.15” This fact alone makes it
very difficult for insurers to calculate the level of risk and tests organizations resolve to steel
themselves against the ever-growing barrage of cyber attacks.
Non-malicious in nature
If the event is not malicious in nature, this incident becomes a scrubbing exercise. Scrubbing
each machine of the infection, regardless of whether or not it is malicious, requires someone to
physically investigate each device and ensure that it is free of the infection. Depending on the
nature of the attack, this could take anywhere from a matter of minutes to several hours. For
each device, it is important to track the average time that it takes to sanitize it and put it back
online. In an organization that may support thousands of desktop devices, this is not a trivial
matter and may require several teams to accomplish the task. To compound the matter, in
large corporations this situation may be replicated across multiple locations, further adding to
the overall cost of solving this problem. To put this in perspective, consider an organization
with 5,000 desktop users, all infected with a virus. Assuming the CSIRT has recognized the
problem and isolated the outbreak to the main campus where the 5,000 desktops are situated,
it will require 1.5 hours of effort for each user desktop to be cleaned, rebooted and re-scanned.
In other words, 5,000 desktops * 1.5 hours * 51.02 burdened cost per hour = $382,650.00 for
scrubbing. This should make managers eager to pay a license fee for a good Antivirus
protection solution.

Types of Cyberattacks
Description
Caller ID Spoofing A type of attack where the attacker initiates calls with falsified Caller-ID information making it appear to the called party as someone they are not.
Check Sync Reboot A type of attack where the attacker spoofs or floods “CHECK SYNC” reboot messages into the signaling channel resulting in the caller’s phone to constantly reboot.
Denial of Service (DoS) A method of attack from a single source that denies system access to legitimate users by overwhelming the target computer with messages and blocking legitimate traffic. It
can prevent a system from being able to exchange data with other systems or use the Internet.
Distributed Denial of Service A variant of the denial-of-service attack that uses a coordinated attack from a distributed system of computers rather than from a single source. It often makes use of
(DD0S) worms to spread to multiple computers that can then attack the target.
Eavesdropping Unauthorized interception of VoIP IP based calls either before encryption occurs or by analyzer probe of sniffer if unencrypted via malware.
Exploit tools Publicly available and sophisticated tools that intruders of various skill levels can use to determine vulnerabilities and gain entry into targeted systems.
Flooding A type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack designed to bring a network down by flooding the network with incomplete connection requests, preventing it from processing
legitimate traffic.
Fuzzing Also known as fuzz testing, this is black box software that uses malformed or semi-malformed data injection looking for bugs and vulnerabilities in code.
Logic bombs A form of sabotage in which a programmer inserts code that causes the program to perform a destructive action when some triggering event occurs, such as terminating
the programmer’s employment.
Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Man-in-the-middle, bucket-brigade, or Janus attack occurs is a form of eavesdropping in which the attacker places themselves between proxies and takes over control of
the conversation and can impersonate other users.
Phishing The creation and use of e-mails and web sites—designed to look like those of well-known legitimate businesses, financial institutions, and government agencies—in order to
deceive Internet users into disclosing their personal data, such as bank and financial account information and passwords. The phishers then use that information for criminal
purposes, such as identity theft and fraud.
Redirection A type of attack where the attacker sends 301/302 moved messages to inbound calls which are then redirected to any phone chosen by the attacker.
Registration Hijacking A type of attack where the legitimate endpoint registration is replaced with an endpoint pointed to a malicious device rather than the legitimate device.
RTP/Audio Injection A type of attack where the attacker injects new media or audio into an active media channel.
Session Tear Down A type of attack where the attacker spoofs or floods “BYE” or “HANGUP” tear down messages into the signaling channel.
Sniffer Synonymous with packet sniffer. A program that intercepts routed data and examines each packet in search of specified information, such as passwords transmitted in clear
text.
Trojan horse A computer program that conceals harmful code. A Trojan horse usually masquerades as a useful program that a user would wish to execute.
Virus A program that infects computer files, usually executable programs, by inserting a copy of itself into the file. These copies are usually executed when the infected file is
loaded into memory, allowing the virus to infect other files. Unlike a computer worm, a virus requires human involvement (usually unwittingly) to propagate.
Vishing A method of phishing based on voice-over-Internet Protocol technology and open-source call center software that have made it inexpensive for scammers to set up phony
call centers and criminals to send e-mail or text messages to potential victims, saying there has been a security problem and they need to call their bank to reactivate a
credit or debit card, or send text messages to cell phones, instructing potential victims to contact fake online banks to renew their accounts.
VoIP SPAM (SPIT) Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is a type of attack where businesses and individuals are inundated with annoying and resource-draining calls.
War driving A method of gaining entry into wireless computer networks using a laptop, antennas and a wireless network adaptor that involves patrolling locations to gain unauthorized
access.
Worm An independent computer program that reproduces by copying itself from one system to another across a network. Unlike computer viruses, worms do not require human
involvement to propagate.
Zero-day exploit A cyber threat taking advantage of a security vulnerability on the same day that the vulnerability becomes known to the general public and for which there are no available
fixes.

25CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
Malicious in nature
If the event is malicious in nature or of an unknown type, the CSIRT should attempt to classify
it. If this is the case, it is almost a certainty that more time will be involved than the
organization really wants to spend dealing with a cyber event. Unfortunately, there is really
little choice in the matter. If an organization decides to respond inappropriately, usually the
impact of such a decision will have devastating and long lasting effects. It is because of this
reason many organizations feel like they are held hostage until the effects of such an event can
be mitigated. They rely on the expertise and skill of their CSIRTs to resolve the issue, hoping
those people have the skills necessary to make quick work of the problem. Unfortunately, this
is not the case for many organizations. Studies have shown that organizations not investing in
the skill sets necessary to respond to such events until it is too late rarely escape unscathed. A
recent study16 of network administrators showed that “Nearly four-in-ten (39%) were kept up at
night worrying about a security breach to their network in 2010, which was significantly higher
than in 2009 (27%). Similar proportions (each year) were kept up at night worrying about their
users.” It really becomes a case of “pay me now” or “pay me later.” The all too frequent reality
is that the “pay me later” part comes sooner than anyone expects.
DETERMINE SOURCE OF CYBER-INCIDENT
It is important to keep vigilant at all times and to have mechanisms to detect a potential
compromise or attack via operational practices. When a cyber event occurs, it is important to
determine if the event is internal or external in origin. The CSIRT will want to quickly find out if
the attack is coming through the firewall or from within its boundaries. In many instances, new
cyber incidents can be caused when an unsuspecting user downloads an infected file or installs
something they downloaded on their machine, or when they insert a diskette or a flash drive
into their machine and that turns out to be infected. Regardless of whether or not the pain is
self-inflicted, an organization must still factor in the time and effort expended at this step as a
direct labor cost. Once again, consider the effects of this situation in an organization that has
thousands of users across dozens of locations. Even if it only takes one day to clean up such a
mess, the direct costs as well as the indirect costs, in terms of lost productivity, can add up to
very significant numbers quickly.

Research, Inc., April 30, 2010 by VanDyke Software®, Albuquerque, NM.
26CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
The sad reality about cyber attacks is that those targets whom hackers feel are most worth
pursuing are most often the largest companies in the world. Attacking a smaller insignificant
organization is very much like picking on a little guy just because you’re bigger-there is no glory
to be had in the matter. Cyber attackers generally go after big fish because it gives them huge
bragging rights within their underground communities. Anything less is seen as amateurish and
looked down upon within their own community of hacker peers.
Identification
Sometimes the initial notification of an incident may be via phone call or email. Regardless of
mechanism of identification, the reported issue should lead to the point of differentiating
between an event and an incident. An event is anything that happens in an environment and
an incident occurs when that event threatens or causes some harm to the organization. In
some events, an incident response team is called because someone sees an event and treats it
as suspicious in nature. It is very important to conduct due diligence by reviewing the logs or
any other form of evidence to come to a conclusion whether to treat the issue as an event or a
potential incident.
Determine if the Threat Will Spread
Once someone has detected that a cyber attack is underway, the organization must quickly
determine if it is attempting to propagate. It is important to know if the malware threat is
malicious and is attempting to propagate, or even if it is not malicious but still attempting to
propagate because the effects can be devastating. If the malware is attempting to propagate,
one of the first things the responder must do is isolate the effects of propagation from the
network to prevent it from spreading everywhere within the boundaries of the network. This
requires quick thinking, quick action, and knowledge that is generally obtained from being well
trained and prepared to handle such incidents. The investment in getting someone trained to
this level can be considered a preventative cost but, once the event has manifested itself, the
actions taken by the CSIRT are absolutely considered as direct costs. In the 2010 survey
27CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
mentioned on the previous page17, when discussing security management issues, threat of virus
infections in an organization ranked among the top three concerns.
Marshal the CSIRT
When the incident is reported, the incident handler should document as much as possible in an
effort to discern any leading information that could direct the investigation. Once the malicious
activity is confirmed, detailed note taking of the handler’s actions and chain of custody should
be maintained from this point forward. And once it has been confirmed that the events are
the result of security incident, the appropriate members of the Incident handling team should
be contacted and the official incident management activity be initiated18.
The act of notifying anyone of a security incident sets off a chain of events, generally cascading
into a series of meetings by various departments within the organization to discuss how to
resolve the cyber security incident and what the impacts of that incident will be to their specific
departments and to the organization as a whole. All of the costs of these meetings should be
figured as direct costs of labor. This process requires that participants periodically review the
need to convene meetings with the CSIRT.
In many cases, the security response team is busy responding to the event and cannot
participate in such meetings. Generally the manager of that team will be the only participant
and will provide periodic updates as to the status of the incident. Because of the ripple effect
the status updates have with the remaining departments within the organization, it is
important that the CSIRT manager provide accurate and timely status. Preparation for and
participation in these meetings should also be considered as direct costs.

28CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
Perform Analysis
When a cyber event occurs, it is important for the response team to analyze all available data
sources. In order to accurately understand what has happened when a security event occurs,
security response teams must look at both internal data and external data, along with any data
that is collected proactively during the course of the event. The time taken to collect and
analyze this data should be tracked as a direct cost of the event itself. It is important to
consider the fact that those who collected data may not be the same people that analyze the
data. As an example, the network administrator would gather event logs and send them to a
security analyst for review. Just because the response team does not immediately have the
data in their possession, it does not mean that those costs of data collection should be
overlooked. The person who performs cost accounting for the incident needs to be aware of
the amount of effort expended by whom, whenever data collection occurs. It is important to
factor in both the source of the data and the cost of obtaining it along with the cost of analyzing
that data.
Analyze Internal and External Resources
Internal data generally takes the form of event logs from applications and devices. More often
than not, this data will be gathered by asking systems administrators to pull logs from servers
within the domains that have been affected by the cyber security incident. Those logs may
come from several other sources as well, as discussed in the following sections.
i. Security Device logs. Firewalls and routers create logs when events take place.
Sometimes logging activities have to be enabled before data can be collected. If
the devices are not enabled when an event occurs, there will be no data to
review. The adage “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” holds true
in this case.
ii. Bandwidth Utilization Reports. Tools used to monitor the network can
generally track the utilization of bandwidth and, when spikes in usage occur,
alerts and notifications can be made. If there are no such tools in place, then
this step cannot occur. The cost of these tools, when used before an incident,
would be preventative costs. If they are implemented after an incident, they
should be considered remediation costs.
29CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
iii. Network traffic flow data. In order to monitor traffic flow on a network, a
monitoring tool has to be in place. Although the tool itself may be hardware or
software, it generally requires someone with the skills necessary to understand
what they’re doing to use the tool correctly. Once again, consider whether or
not this is a preventative or remediated cost, based on the pre or post incident
scenario described above.
iv. Application and system logs. Application and system logs are used extensively
in operating systems and provide a great deal of information. The main
drawback the application and system logs is that they create an overwhelming
amount of information that must be processed. Generally the processing
requires a tool to filter the number of events down to something manageable.
Another factor to consider is that many people do not know where all of these
logs exist in an operating system environment because they seldom use them.
Thus it takes additional time to hunt them down which slows the process of
mitigating an event and costs the organization even more money.
In all of the situations described above, each step that takes place is a form of direct labor cost.
What is not tracked accurately in most cases is how much time and effort is expended at each
of these steps. Careful analysis at this stage will reveal a more accurate picture of the true
costs of an incident. Once again, the individual performing cost accounting for the cyber
security incident needs to consider both the cost of obtaining the data as well as the cost of
analyzing the data.
Over the course of the last decade, with so many cyber security incidents that have taken place,
many security staff learned that the quickest way to understand a problem is to simply go out
to the Internet and check to see if someone else has dealt with the problem in the past. There
are many, many sites that one can check to learn about security events. Regardless of which
sites you check or how many of them you check, the act of investigating these sites itself is still
a direct labor cost that should be factored in to the overall cost of the incident. The good news
here is that in many cases, checking these external sites as a point of reference can often save
the organization a great deal of time and money because someone else will have already faced
the situation and found a solution to the problem. Being able to leverage someone else’s
knowledge--particularly if that knowledge has been vetted by reliable source, such as a Federal
Agency or well known security organization--will save an organization a great deal of money.
Other places to look for external data include:
30CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
i. NIPC/CERT. The National Infrastructure Protection Center and the Computer
Emergency Response Team are both reputable and definitive sources of
information for cyber security events. Both of these organizations should be
checked before looking elsewhere. Once again, the time it takes to look for an
event here should be tracked, but investing time here before going anywhere
else will almost always save the organization money in the long run.
ii. Security Discussion Sites. There are many security sites out on the Internet that
are used to discuss the latest threats to an organization. One of the problems
organizations face is in knowing which sites are reputable and can be trusted and
which cannot. In addition to this problem, they could also check hacker sites to
find out who is bragging about the latest security incidents that have hit the net.
Fame and notoriety are strong motivators in the hacker community and that fact
should not be underestimated by any security professional.
iii. Service Provider’s Security Team. In many organizations, particularly very large
organizations, it is common practice to outsource Security Services. Because of
the high level of skill needed for security teams, it makes sense in many business
models to outsource this service as opposed to growing its capability from within
an organization.
Due to the unique nature of the cybersecurity domain, it is recommended that incident
response skills be developed within the organization for a multitude of reasons, not the least of
which is the ability to respond within the least amount of time and for that response to be the
correct response every time.
Collecting “Live” Cyber-incident Data
Instances of proactively collected data include all forms of data that, during the course of a
security incident, are collected by a CSIRT who possess the skill sets necessary to perform these
tasks and the desire to track and prosecute the perpetrators. Because the ripple effects into
the customer base of a telecommunications provider can have devastating impact, they are
often very eager to work with law enforcement teams to catch cyber attackers. Costs of these
data collection activities should be attributed as direct labor costs. Some of the activities these
31CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
organizations are willing to support actually do help in the process of gathering information
which can be used by the greater telecommunications community to mitigate the effects of
future cyber attacks. In this case, “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” If
feasible, it is recommended that these teams examine hostile code collected from:
a. “Honey pots” – a honey pot is like a baited trap. It is a network zone specifically
designed to lure unauthorized perpetrators into the zone. These perpetrators
are looking to gather information that can be used for a variety of purposes.
Often the honey pot is filled with bogus data that has very real names and would
be seen as attractive targets to attackers. For example, the data could include
the latest plans for the next telecommunications widget or the secret codes to
the company safe, etc.
b. Compromised System - an evaluation of a compromised system can be very time
consuming but can also yield a great deal of information. Generally, this is a
forensics exercise that requires a very high skill set which equates to a great
expense to the organization. This process is described in more detail later in this
document. Often, malware and root kits are discovered in this process and
these discoveries will lead to an examination of other devices within the
compromised network to ensure that this system is not one of many but the only
one affected. Costs at this stage are direct labor costs for the individual or
individuals performing the forensics work. They can quickly become quite
substantial in the case of a propagating event.
c. Trusted external sources – sometimes organizations that don’t have the
capabilities that many telecommunications organizations have will send
compromised hosts to an external source for evaluation. Generally this is not a
free exercise and the costs can be significant. All of these costs should be
reflected as consequential because the organization did not incur them directly
but through the services of an outside party.
32CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
Sharing Cyber-incident Knowledge
We recommend that organizations that endure the pain of a cyber security incident consider
making any collected code and analysis data available to the security community at large.
While this, in and of itself, is a very good thing, it still requires internal staff to take the time and
effort to notify various organizations and agencies of their findings. Once again, this is a direct
cost and should be factored as such. Sometimes, a legal review of the data is required before
release and this could be a possible consequential cost as well.
RESPONDING TO THE CYBER-INCIDENT
The primary thing an organization must do when confronted with a cyber security attack is to
respond to the attack. Generally, that response will be to marshal troops and point them
towards the problem. While it may not seem like this is an obvious cost, the direct cost of labor
to perform this additional exercise has to be factored in as part of the overall cost of a cyber
security incident. One of the first steps these troops will be tasked to do is to isolate the
compromised device from the rest of the network.
Isolate the compromised hosts(s)
Once identification of a compromised device has been made, it can be isolated from the
remainder of the network in a variety of ways. This process is sometimes referred to as
containment. The core motive of the containment phase is to prevent further damage to any
asset impacted by the incident (i.e., data, network, systems, etc.) so the situation does not get
any worse. If possible, the first and foremost step in this phase is to remove the impacted
system from the network. The most simple and expedient method is simply to disconnect the
network connection and take the box offline. When conducting an exercise of this type, it is
often common practice to continue this activity over a period of days or even weeks to gather
as much information as they can from the attacking party. All of the time spent at this stage is
factored into the cost of a cyber security incident as a direct labor cost.
33CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
Block Malicious Traffic
When and wherever possible, block malicious traffic with existing security devices; in many
instances, such as when a denial of service attack occurs, an organization will try to block
malicious traffic to mitigate the extent of damage the attack can cause. Generally some type of
network filtering will be applied at this step to prevent traffic from a given source or of a certain
protocol from traversing the network. A firewall or perimeter access lists should also be
applied in order to prevent any connectivity into or out of the system. In case of a DOS or
DDOS attack, the traffic should be directed away from the infected system. And once the
damage has been stopped, a detailed analysis of the source/infected system is performed. It is
always good to make two copies of the image of the system which is to be analyzed. In order to
preserve the evidence, the image of the entire system or part of the system is imaged. Then
volatile data is captured, such as all of the running processes.
Once again direct labor costs are the primary factor to consider for calculating the cost of a
cyber security incident. Indirectly, the blockage of legitimate traffic also incurs a cost and the
calculation of that is highly dependent on the nature of the traffic being blocked. Consider the
difference between a brokerage firm executing trades (time sensitive) versus browsing in
informational sites such as Wikipedia. The effects are dramatically different and the costs to
the organization vary just as greatly.
Mitigate the Event
Where available, apply expedient mitigation techniques (based on analysis of code) – it is
commonplace for organizations to try and mitigate the effects of an attack as quickly as they
can. In some instances, an analysis of traffic coming into the network needs to happen before a
decision can be made as to what action should be taken. Often in these cases, law enforcement
agencies are also involved. There are certain times and circumstances where an organization
may wish to perform an exercise called backtracking. In this case, the machine most likely
would be left online and monitored while cyber security experts analyze the traffic and
determine the source of the cyber attack.
34CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
In the majority of cases, however, when the incident has been contained, the next step in the
process is to remove the infection or remnants of the compromise. It requires complete
removal of the malicious code or any data left by the intruder. The compromised system may
require a total rebuild from a clean gold image. The important thing to remember before
rebuilding a system is to ensure that the back-up systems are free from any infection. After the
systems have been restored, the vulnerability analysis of the systems should also be done to
ensure the successful eradication of the infection which also confirms no new vulnerabilities
are introduced. All intended security controls (i.e., access control lists, host filters, firewall
rules, user access permissions, etc.) should be validated to be working properly. Analysis of
code or analysis of packets is a time consuming event that requires highly skilled security teams
or network staff to accomplish it correctly. In either case, the organization is still facing a direct
labor cost that is more than a nominal cost.
Institute Prevention
When possible, patch and harden servers and related networking devices to address specific
issues being exploited – this step is seen as a preventative measure and requires time before an
attack occurs in order for it to be effective. Time spent patching and hardening systems is time
well spent. Cost at this step would be factored into the cost of preventative measures rather
than considered a mitigating cost unless those steps were taken after an event. In that case,
those costs are the result of remediation and are consequential in nature.
Monitor
One of the necessary steps taken in the recovery process is to monitor both the affected host
and the network for signs of subsequent compromise or exploitation. Monitor the network for
signs of additional compromise – Vigilance is the cornerstone of success in a network
protection scheme. Monitoring, like patching, is considered a preventative measure. One
might make the assumption that the approach needed is to add layer upon layer of defenses
onto a security protection scheme; that would be a correct one to make. This approach has
been referred to by the Department of Defense as a defense in depth strategy19. In this
approach to protecting data, the basic premise of building up, layering on and overlapping of
19 Joint Pub 3-13, 9 October 1998, “Joint Doctrine for Information Operations”,
http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf.
35CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
security measures is called defense in depth. The strength of any system is no greater than its
weakest link. Using a defense in depth strategy, should one defensive measure fail, the
assumption is there are other defensive measures in place that continue to provide protection.
These steps are yet another example of the costs of vigilance which we have stated above
should be factored in as a preventative cost.
Make Notifications
Where appropriate, the organization should advise vendors and their customers of
mitigation/recovery options. This step becomes a bit tricky since the organization that has
suffered the attack may not incur direct costs at this point. However, the vendor may incur
costs related to notification of their customers, actions taken by vendor staff to mitigate the
impact of the cyber attack, and even consequential costs that may be attributed to the attack
should be factored into the overall cost. There is not a specific methodology for calculating
these types of costs, but a common method would be for the organization to inquire of their
vendors how many people were used in the process of notification and mitigation as it relates
specifically to the event. The vendor organization most likely will translate those costs into
direct labor costs which should be tallied from the organization’s perspective as a consequential
cost simply because the money used to pay for that cost originated from the vendor’s coffers
and was passed on to the organization after the incident.
Involve Law Enforcement when Necessary
If suspected criminal acts have occurred, report those to your local law enforcement agency. If
the cyber incident merits reporting to a law enforcement agency, there will be both direct costs
of gathering information to be used as evidence, maintaining a chain of custody for that
evidence, and documenting all of the steps taken up to the point when law enforcement takes
control of the situation. Conversely, what steps does an organization take to prevent law
enforcement agencies from taking action against them if there is a loss of data or a cyber
incident? What if they are an international company? The risks can be substantial.
36CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
Determine Need for Forensics
During the recovery process, it is important that an organization consider the need to collect
data for forensic analysis. In evaluating the magnitude and the severity of a cyber event, the
security team often has to make the determination as to whether or not to begin collecting
forensic evidence. Generally, if law enforcement needs to be involved, there is a need for
forensics. This decision can result in a substantially increased cost to the organization for the
incident. Additionally, once the decision has been made to collect forensic evidence, the chain
of custody for that evidence must be established in accordance with state and federal
guidelines. The general process used for performing digital forensics comprises the following
basic phases.20
Collection: identifying, labeling, recording, and acquiring data from the possible sources
of relevant data, while following procedures that preserve the integrity of the data.
Examination: forensically processing collected data using a combination of automated
and manual methods, and assessing and extracting data of particular interest, while
preserving the integrity of the data.
Analysis: analyzing the results of the examination, using legally justifiable methods and
techniques, to derive useful information that addresses the questions that were the
impetus for performing the collection and examination.
Reporting: reporting the results of the analysis, which may include describing the
actions used, explaining how tools and procedures were selected, determining what
other actions need to be performed (e.g., forensic examination of additional data
sources, securing identified vulnerabilities, improving existing security controls) and
providing recommendations for improvement to policies, procedures, tools and other
aspects of the forensic process.
It is not hard to imagine how quickly these additional costs can add up once this decision has
been made. It is for this reason that many organizations simply decide to endure the pain of
the cyber incident and forgo any hope of investigation that could lead to an ultimate
prosecution of the attacker. Because this decision is made more often than not, the costs here

2006, pp 9. Retrieved from http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
37CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
should certainly be weighed heavily into the overall cost of the cyber security incident. What
many people fail to recognize at this step is the impact of not proceeding with a forensic
evidence collection process and incurring the cost of that process. This inaction may actually be
more harmful to the organization in the long run. While the organization may save money in
direct labor costs, by making such a decision, they need to consider whether that savings
actually is greater than the consequential costs they incur by avoiding the evidence collection
process.
BEGIN RECOVERY
In the recovery phase, the desire is to return an organization to the state it operated in prior to
the cyber attack. Before this can happen, generally there is a lot of work that has already
occurred to clean infected hosts and prepare them to go back online. Most organizations will
recover compromised hosts in accordance with their disaster recovery or business continuity
and disaster recovery plans. In large organizations, it is commonplace to have a disaster
recovery and business continuity planning officer. This person would be involved at this stage,
along with any appropriate staff, in helping to determine a proper course of action to take in
order to recover from the cyber event. Upon validation of the security and business functions,
the systems should be put back online. In this phase, QA teams and business partners should
be involved to validate the fact that system recovery is successful to make sure that all business
processes and functions are back to normal. The final step in the recovery phase is to ensure
that the system is being monitored to ensure that future problems are detected in a timely
fashion and to look for any additional signs of attack21.
Next, the CSIRT should survey the infrastructure for other vulnerable hosts and patch/harden
systems as appropriate. This step should be considered as a remediation measure and the costs
incurred here would be tallied as preventative costs. At this stage, the organization will usually
begin to quantify any loss, especially if they seeking legal remedies. The quantification process
itself varies greatly from organization to organization but regardless of the organization, it
really bears down to either an indirect, direct or consequential cost. The real exercise here is
determining at which step to apply which type of cost. Every organization has a finance group
that can help them figure out which methods are to be used as they uniquely suit that

organization’s needs. What is important here is an agreement to align the costs along those
three areas so that “apples-to-apples” comparisons can be made when another cyber incident
occurs. If other organizations use a similar methodology, then costs between organizations can
be compared.
Conduct a Post-mortem
It is not uncommon for an organization to also conduct post-mortem analysis of the cyber
security incident and the costs here are direct labor costs because they require time and effort
for people to attend meetings and discuss the issues. The importance of this activity is to
enhance and improve the incident-handling process and to work through all identified residual
issues, discovered during the incident, that improve the security posture of the organization. In
this phase the handler should ask the following:
What systems were compromised?
How did the compromise occur?
What steps were taken to contain the incident?
What steps were taken to clean the infection?
What steps were taken to ensure the compromise is not repeated again?
Determine if this is a reportable incident.
All findings should be formally documented with recommendations to be reviewed with
stakeholders. The stakeholders must develop action plans with target dates to remediate or
minimize the impact of any compromise which occurred. Actions taken as a result of these
meetings may translate into preventative costs since they are designed, by their very nature, to
avoid a repeat of the incident. Often organizations will revise procedures and conduct training
based on post-mortem analysis. Any change an organization makes as a result of a cyber
security incident, in order to prevent a reoccurrence of the effects of that incident, should be
construed as a preventative measure. As such, the costs should be considered preventative.
At this stage, the organization will usually begin to formally quantify any loss, especially if they
seeking legal remedies. The quantification process itself varies greatly from organization to
organization but, regardless of the organization, it really is either an indirect, direct or
consequential cost. The real exercise here is determining at which step to apply which type of
cost. Every organization has a finance group that can help them figure out which methods are

to be used as they uniquely suit that organization’s needs. What is important here is an
agreement to align the costs along those three areas so that “apples-to-apples” comparisons
can be made when another cyber incident occurs. If other organizations use a similar
methodology, then costs between organizations can be compared.
Finally, in the recovery stage, organizations often look towards their legal department for
review of actions taken from the time notification of the incident occurred until a walk into the
legal office to discuss it. Generally, the legal team will want a chronological summation of all
activities taken throughout the course of the cyber security incident. Once again, this will
require someone to expend the effort needed to create these documents. These direct costs
are almost always overlooked and should not be since they can also add up to a significant
amount of work and money. The framework of thought presented in this document should help
companies find a path forward when an incident takes place. More importantly, it should help
them mitigate the effects of an incident by having the knowledge to prepare before an incident
occurs and to minimize the effects (costs) to the maximum extent possible.
INCIDENT RESPONSE MATURITY
One aspect of Incident response that is often overlooked is Incident Response (IR) Maturity.
This view of IR analyzes the character of the IR strategy implemented by the organization. Just
as there is a difference in the maturity of people, ranging from a baby, a child, a teenager,
young adult, middle-aged and senior citizen, there can also be differences in the maturity and
capability of an organization’s IR approach. When we describe an individual, we rarely stop at
“he’s human.” So why should we limit the classification of IR plans to a single group? We
understand the maturity concept when applied to people. We know that as a baby grows and
becomes a child, his or her abilities change, increase and become more refined. But this child
can’t do everything that the older individuals can do. Similarly, not all IR strategies are as
effective, robust and comprehensive as others.
Once we consider the characteristic of maturity when it comes to Incident Response, we must
decide how to measure the difference. How do we grade or classify IR strategies so that a
meaningful comparison or evaluation can be made? Additionally, there will likely be different
aspects of IR maturity to consider, and an organization may be more mature in one area than
40CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
another. A similar concern exists when it comes to understanding the maturity of an
organization’s security. The Information Systems Auditability and Control Association (ISACA)
developed the COBIT22 framework to help organizations understand its security and audit
requirements within its technology department. One component to COBIT is the concept of
Maturity Model. COBIT looks at four areas of IT:
Plan and Organize
Acquire and Implement
Deliver and Support
Monitor and Evaluate
COBIT proposes several controls for each group above to support the organization, but it also
applies a maturity model. Six levels of maturity are then used to classify the organization’s
control environment:
1. Non existent
2. Initial/ad hoc
3. Repeatable but intuitive
4. Defined
5. Managed and Measureable
6. Optimized
We might supply a similar approach to help understand the maturity differences between IR
strategies. If we were to group all of the other discussion in this document into four areas, we
might focus on:
Incident Governance
Incident Planning
Incident Response
Incident Analysis
22 COBIT 4.1 – IT Governance Institute, ISACA. www.isaca.org
41CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
For each of these areas we could then apply a multi-level grading system that helps describe
how well the organization has adopted the IR strategy. For the sake of this discussion, let us
refer to the maturity levels described in COBIT. The following are just general descriptions of
these four areas. The reader is urged to go to the specific sections of this document for more
detail.
Incident Governance
Incident governance describes the high level strategy and support that comes from the highest
levels of the organization and includes:
Formal statement of support signed by the CEO or Chairman and approved by the
board.
Charter or mission statement for the purpose of planning for, identifying, addressing
and analyzing incidents that impact the normal operations of the organization.
Support for a mechanism to provide the appropriate executive data regarding incidents
to the executive team so that appropriate top-level involvement is maintained.
Functional support in the form of funding, personnel, reporting structure, etc. to deliver
on the elements of the IR charter.
Incident Planning
The best time to deal with an incident is before it occurs--in other words through effective
planning. Several questions need answers before the first sign of a problem:
Have you defined what an incident is?
Have you identified and categorized the assets?
Have you identified the threats?
Have you designed and documented an Incident Response Plan?
Is your Incident Response Plan kept up-to-date?
Has the relevant personnel been trained for an incident?
Do you conduct scenario testing?
42CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
Have you included participation and support from legal, PR, operations, regulatory, HR
and financial departments within your organization?
Incident Response
How well does the organization address the response to an incident? Is it ad hoc, off-the-cuff or
do they have scripted and tested responses that are flexible enough to address the incident as
well as detailed enough to speed decision making and response? Does the organization have
the personnel with proper training and the right tools to address the incident? Is the response
manually initiated or automatic? Each of the suggestions put forth in this document must stand
this same test: how well does the organization implement the suggestion? Other questions
include:
What is the scope of monitoring?
All systems or just “critical” systems?
Support for 24x7 or 8x5 operations?
On-site or remote support?
What data or information is critical and what can be replaced?
Is there appropriate legal, HR, and technical guidance?
Are the channels of communication formally opened or only as needed?
Incident Analysis
Even after the incident is resolved the work is not done – the incident and the response must
be analyzed.
Do you know what data has legal significance?
How do you discover all relevant data for Legal?
Did you maintain the chain of custody?
Do you have an established storage retention plan for maintaining chain of custody
data?
Do you have the skill set internally to complete forensic analysis?
43CSRIC Incident Response Recommendations
Do you analyze the event to improve response effectiveness in the future?
These topics and questions are just examples of those that need to be considered when
determining the maturity of your IR strategy. This aspect of incident response is not to get a
“passing grade” or “to do better than the competition.” It is meant to assess the strengths and
weaknesses within your IR plan. With this knowledge you can, through repeated improvement
and reassessment, grow your strategy into a mature and extremely effective solution.
REAL-TIME SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IN CYBERSPACE
We recommend all organizations take steps to improve real-time situational awareness and
enhance the identification of network anomalies. Doing so can better protect federal and
public cyberspace and national infrastructure. Security incidents from federal agencies are on
the rise, increasing by over 400 percent from fiscal years 2006 to 2009.23 The U.S. Computer
Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) leads a public - private partnership to protect and
defend the nation cyber infrastructure. It coordinates and facilitates information-sharing
among federal agencies, state and local government, private sector business entities, academia,
international partners, and the general public on cyber security threats and attacks.24 US-CERT
is mandated with sharing cyber security information with the public and private sectors through
various working groups, issuing notices, bulletins, and reports, and when postings. US-CERT is
hindered in its ability to provide an effective analysis and warning program for the federal
government in a number of ways, specifically:
1. US-CERT does not have the appropriate enforcement authority to help mitigate
security incidents. It operates by providing analytical insight into cyber activity,
creating conduits for technical analysis of data, and by characterizing the threat,
vulnerability, and incident response. Additionally, agencies would be required to
respond to incidents no later than 24 hours after discovery or provide notice to US-
CERT as to why no action has been taken. Finally, agencies would have to ensure
that the information security vulnerabilities were mitigated timely.

2. US-CERT is unable to monitor federal cyber space in real-time and the tools used do
not allow for real time analysis of network traffic. As a result US-CERT will continue
to be challenged in protecting federal cyber space from security related threats.
Currently US-CERT maintains a near-real-time situational awareness as it performs
information aggregation activities.
3. US-CERT collects data in real-time but it must also be able to perform analysis on the
data in near-real-time. Cyber analysts receive information from a variety of sources
and other US-CERT activities are used to identify potential incidents and to assess
their possible scope and impact on the nation's cyber infrastructure.
4. US-CERT employs technology systems and tools to fulfill its mission requirements to
protect and defend nation's infrastructure against potential threats and cyberspace,
and respond to security incidents. Currently US-CERT uses a wide variety of tools to
detect and mitigate cyber security incidents.
With the introduction of the Einstein program, US-CERT can gather more network traffic
information and identify cyber activity patterns. However, US-CERT cannot capture all network
traffic because Einstein has not been deployed to all federal agencies since, in its initial stages,
the deployment of Einstein 1 to federal agencies was entirely voluntary. In September 2008,
OMB made Einstein part of the trusted Internet connections initiative and required all agencies
to install sensors on their
networks.25,26
As of October 2009, they deployed Einstein 1 to 19
agencies and Einstein 2 to eight agencies. Currently, US-CERT is conducting a pilot program to
exercise Einstein's capabilities. According to a comprehensive national cyber security initiative
and US-CERT officials, Einstein 3 will not contain real time full packet inspection and intrusion
prevention features. These additions should give US-CERT better response and monitoring
capabilities.
According to US-CERT officials, many agencies have not installed Einstein because they have not
consolidated their gateways to the Internet.27 Some agencies have fragmented networks and
must upgrade their architectures before Einstein can be deployed. Additionally, US-CERT does
not have an automated correlation tool to identify trends and anomalies. With the vast
amounts of network traffic, US-CERT experienced a long lead time to analyze potential security

threats and abnormalities. To reduce the lead-time, an automated correlation tool was
purchased to analyze the data from Einstein. However, US-CERT is currently experiencing
problems with reconfiguring the tool to collect data and understand the overall data flow. US-
CERT management stated that it may be six months before the problems are corrected and the
benefits of the system can be seen.
With the Homeland Security Act of 2002, DHS was required to establish appropriate systems,
mechanisms and procedures to share homeland security information, relevant to threats and
vulnerabilities in national critical infrastructure, with other federal departments and agencies,
state and local governments and the private sector, in a timely manner. The National Strategy
to Secure Cyberspace recommends that DHS coordinate with other federal agencies to share
specific warning information and advise them of appropriate protective measures and counter
measures. An effective analysis and warning program is critical to secure the Federal
information technology infrastructure and national critical infrastructure. For US-CERT to
perform its responsibilities successfully, it must have significant technical resources and
analytical tools and technologies to identify, collect, analyze and respond to cyber attacks.
Currently the National Security Agency is launching an expansive program dubbed "Perfect
Citizen" to detect cyber assaults on private companies and government agencies running such
critical infrastructure as electricity grid and nuclear power plants28. Perfect Citizen, in theory,
would rely on a set of sensors deployed in computer networks’ for critical infrastructure that
would be triggered by unusual activity suggesting an impending cyber attack, though it
wouldn't persistently monitor the whole system.
Perfect Citizen Systems will look at large, typical older computer control systems that were
often designed without Internet connectivity or security in mind many of those systems which
run everything from subway systems to air traffic control networks have been linked to the
Internet and making them more efficient but also exposing them to cyber attacks. According to
NSA the program is purely a vulnerability assessment and capabilities development contract, a
research and engineering effort5. By taking into consideration all these efforts to bridge the gap
and create a real-time awareness and mitigation program, the FCC would need to create:

Widespread information security control efficiencies.
Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) between carriers.
Collaborative working environment with inter agency programs like Perfect Citizen.
Today, cyber-incidents are handled in reactive mode. At best, only ”near real time” can be
achieved and even then would only be near real time for isolated incidents. A coordinated
multi-tiered cyber-incident could gridlock the system, resources, and ability to analyze and
mitigate. A strategy that would provide the capability to respond real time and be proactive in
mitigation rather than respond in a reactive mode is sorely needed. Combined with updated
security policies and practices to incorporate the aforementioned strategy would ensure
successful mitigation across all spectrums of cyber-incidents.
