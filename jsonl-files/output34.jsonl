One major issue was the lack of sufficient public outreach by the FCC regarding these best practices, as noted in the EAS Security Public Notice. This resulted in insufficient industry feedback on the implementation of recommended measures, which hindered the team's ability to assess barriers to adoption. Furthermore, the team could not identify existing resources or conduct independent industry surveys due to administrative restrictions, limiting their capacity to gather necessary information."}]}

This proposal aimed to ensure compliance with CSRIC-recommended best practices. The NPRM also included procedures for confidentially treating the certification forms and information, as well as sharing these with other federal agencies. Consequently, it somewhat superseded the task of merely recommending incentives or assurance methods for adopting these practices, as federal certification itself acts as a significant incentive. Despite challenges, the CSRIC V team worked to fulfill their task and recommended avoiding enforcement actions against EAS Participants in security breach cases if they comply with the recommended security measures."}]}

WG3's task of recommending incentives for stakeholders to adopt best practices was effectively overridden, as avoiding FCC penalties served as a sufficient incentive.\n5. Proposed procedures in the NPRM for the treatment of certification-related information negated WG3's task of recommending methods for other stakeholders to gain assurance of practice implementation.

It supplements the Emergency Alert System (EAS) by adding robust and diverse pathways for message delivery, including Internet Protocol networks. IPAWS accepts standards-based alert messages from emergency managers, which are formatted in the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP). These messages are processed by the FEMA IPAWS aggregator and then distributed through all available means to reach the public. EAS Participants utilize special encoding and decoding equipment to receive and retransmit these messages. However, while CAP integration provides enhanced redundancy, it also introduces potential cyber vulnerabilities as it opens additional gateways into the system via IP integration."}]}

As noted by the CSRIC IV, CAP/EAS equipment now spans both internal and external networks to manage alert and warning content. To mitigate risks, a holistic approach is recommended for EAS participants, alert originators, and manufacturers to enhance security and recovery measures. CSRIC V WG3 suggests that while best practices are voluntary, they should be tailored to the organization’s needs and capabilities. They emphasize the need for the FCC to improve its outreach and education on these best practices to ensure a secure EAS ecosystem, addressing both basic and advanced security challenges."}]}
