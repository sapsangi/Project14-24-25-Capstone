These devices often remain dormant to avoid detection while waiting for attack orders. The sophistication of botnets has evolved, allowing them to update with new malware versions, enhancing attack capabilities and obfuscation techniques. The malware may be polymorphic, making it difficult to detect via signature-based methods. Utilizing advanced command and control mechanisms, such as peer-to-peer technology, botnets effectively evade detection within ISP infrastructure, using vulnerabilities like DNS to spread malware. Once a device is part of a botnet, it poses threats by compromising personal information and exposing ISP networks to attacks like spam and denial of service. To mitigate these risks, disrupting the botnet lifecycle and targeting device-level malware is crucial.
