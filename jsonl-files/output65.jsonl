Convention centers, like Moscone in SF, often have areas below street level, which can impact signal attenuation when accessed externally. Stadiums, such as ATT Park, are known for their challenging RF signal environments due to their location and structure. Historic buildings like the US Court of Appeals have thick masonry that can impede signal penetration. Urban motels, although smaller, may be crowded by taller structures affecting signal access. High-rise buildings in places like San Jose provide great visibility across areas, but the presence of nearby tall buildings can complicate signal management.

The uncertainty and TTFF (Time To First Fix) data provide insights into the consistency and reliability of the signals. For example, Polaris_BD2_TP4 has a notably high Max Error and lower percentage of calls with error under uncertainty criteria, indicating potential instability at that test point. \n\nSwitching to the Qualcomm_BD2_TP results, we observe generally high yields, with most test points yielding over 96% position fix success rates. Qualcomm_BD2_TP3 even achieved a 100% yield, showcasing very reliable performance. Horizontal Error Statistics reveal the average, maximum, and percentile errors for each test point, which further helps in assessing accuracy. Notably, Qualcomm_BD2_TP3 has the lowest standard deviation in Horizontal Error, indicating very consistent accuracy in this set of tests."}]}

However, RF fingerprinting performs well in such settings because the environment can be extensively calibrated and it leverages many RF cell sites and handoff boundaries. The best observed performance in dense urban areas comes from dedicated terrestrial (beacon) location systems, which offer high accuracy that even reveals multi-path vagaries.

For example, a baseball stadium like AT&T Park in San Francisco may cause AGPS fallback fixes to be very far due to exposed RF propagation, impacting deep interior points and posing challenges for RF fingerprinting. Similarly, buildings like convention centers that have strong indoor cellular signals, possibly from a Distributed Antenna System (DAS), can result in poor performance of beacon-based location systems due to strong attenuation in various directions. For older, heavy constructions like the US Court of Appeals Building, the presence of a large atrium and windows affects location accuracy, with results varying significantly based on proximity to these features. These factors collectively degrade satellite-based systems, particularly when test points are far from windows or atria."}]}

For instance, in San Francisco, RF fingerprinting fixes tend to cluster around street reflectors near targets rather than pinpointing the exact building. Inaccuracies can lead to emergency services being dispatched to wrong locations despite distances seeming minor outdoors. High-rise buildings, like those in downtown San Jose, exacerbate these issues by causing AGPS and beacon system performance to degrade with altitude. The urban setting's lower cell site density further contributes to these challenges."}]}

Individual houses or small apartment buildings often allow for outstanding GPS performance, nearly as good as outdoors. Single-story homes and the upper floors of relatively small buildings with composite or tile roofs tend to yield GPS fixes with errors well below 50 meters.

Larger companies often needed a hybrid of the common template and their own legal forms, and even with agreement in principle, legal and contracts departments were slow to process changes. Difficult terms included cancellation, indemnification, acceptance, and payment.

To mitigate these issues, it's recommended to implement a more formal go/no-go gate process before testing to ensure all participants are prepared.

From a technical perspective, a ground truth accuracy better than 5 meters was initially set as a minimum; however, achieving a more precise accuracy of better than 1 meter was recommended for efficacy.
