The system is managed by a Board that operates a virtual PSAP network, which includes eight primary PSAPs and a training room that can function as a standby PSAP. The Board does not operate the PSAPs directly; instead, it has agreements with five other agencies, including the Vermont Department of Public Safety and local police and sheriff departments. Equipment is provided by the Board, but call-takers are employed by their respective agencies. The Board trains and certifies call-takers and manages contracts, databases, and data systems needed for seamless 9-1-1 services. The statewide consolidation was motivated by the need to provide 9-1-1 services in Vermont's rural areas, overcoming the limitations of local agencies. Privacy was a key consideration during the implementation, influencing the design of the legislation."}]}
