They recommended that:\n\n- The responsibility for message translation should currently lie with the originators of the message. \n- As language translation technology improves, the Commission should research methodologies used by bilingual and multilingual countries such as Canada and Israel. \n- Further research should be conducted to determine the accuracy and reliability of machine or software-based translation solutions."}]}

It also recommended using Census data for identifying non-English language service needs and geographic areas with high non-English speaking populations. The report stressed consistency in messaging and proposed a multi-language look-up table for SAME/EAS Event Codes to automate translation. Additionally, adherence to the CAP standard was noted as not sufficient on its own to assure compatibility with existing systems, raising potential interoperability issues."}]}

This enhances warning effectiveness and streamlines the alert process. To further refine CAP's application, the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) CAP Profile was developed, which describes how to use CAP specifically within the IPAWS context. FEMA, in collaboration with OASIS, developed this profile to ensure interoperability and precise usage among system exchange partners. The CAP IPAWS Profile was approved as an OASIS Committee Specification on October 13, 2009."}]}

It was developed by integrating the requirements of three federal warning-delivery systems: the Emergency Alert System (EAS) as recommended by the ECIG, NOAA's Non-Weather Emergency Message (NWEM) 'HazCollect' program, and the Commercial Mobile Alert Service (CMAS) for cellular phones. Partners such as NOAA, FCC, and the DHS Science & Technology Directorate collaborated with FEMA to create this profile. Additionally, the EAS-CAP Implementation Guide was published in May 2010 by the EAS-CAP Industry Group to aid in the interpretation of CAP formatted data, ensuring that alerts are presented consistently to the public."}]}

CAP v1.2 and the CAP v1.2 IPAWS Profile v1.0 employ several free-text and optional elements, which may result in differences when messages are rendered by different CAP-to-EAS devices. This can cause discrepancies between the intended alert content by the originator and what is broadcast. The EAS-CAP Implementation Guide helps address these challenges by providing specific details on sending data within the broadcast environment using current FCC rules. It offers audio and text length standards as well as tips for originators and software to accommodate the broadcast environment and existing regulations."}]}
