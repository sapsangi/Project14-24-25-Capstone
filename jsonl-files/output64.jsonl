Single-story homes and small apartment buildings with composite or tile roofs show strong GPS accuracy, with most GPS fixes falling within the property. Beacon-based location technologies also perform well under these conditions. However, RF fingerprinting degrades in performance, managing only to identify the general neighborhood with wider error spreads. As buildings get larger and taller, especially when test points are not on the top floor, both GPS and Assisted GPS (AGPS) systems experience increased error and position spread due to more frequent reliance on fallback modes."}]}

In suburban areas, terrestrial beacon-based networks generally perform well, particularly in larger buildings, but can be less effective in more complex scenarios like multi-level parking structures. In these cases, signals can bounce off buildings or tunnel through entrances, which might enhance or diminish accuracy. In rural environments, large structures with metal roofs can limit the number of satellite signals available for accurate positioning, leading to an increase in hybrid fixes and variances in location accuracy. In simpler rural settings, where there are fewer obstructions, performance can be better as the positioning signals face fewer interferences."}]}

Yield varied from 85% in dense urban areas to 99% in rural areas due to RF issues in deployed networks. At the 90% level, TTFF ranged from 26 to 33 seconds, with urban and dense urban areas experiencing longer fix times because of network timer issues.

The resulting data may be sent directly to a test vendor for analysis.\n\nIn specific test cases like the CSRIC test bed for RFPM (Radio Frequency Pattern Matching), no active connection to carrier networks was used. Log files were manually correlated, although in production, location calculations are fully automated via standard messaging interfaces like Lb for 2G, Iupc for 3G, or Sls for 4G. No modifications to networks or handsets are required.\n\nTechnologies like NextNav operate in an autonomous GPS mode with minimal carrier network impact, aside from potential software changes if integrating with location servers for hybrid solutions.

Notably:\n\n- Two technologies (AGPS/AFLT and RF Fingerprinting) are already in use for emergency services.\n- The third technology, metropolitan beacons, is not yet commercially available.\n\nAll technologies tested showed relatively high yield and varied accuracy in indoor environments. However, significant standards work is needed for practical implementation in emergency services. It's important to note that costs associated with deployment, operation, maintenance, and handset impact were not fully quantified. Since some methods require handset modifications, integrating these into the subscriber base will take years once the technology is commercially available."}]}

The tests primarily focused on indoor performance and did not fully replicate end-to-end E911 solutions within carrier networks. It's important to note that accuracy and stability can be affected by network changes which were not considered in the tests. Some tests used non-real-time calculations with non-standardized signaling, which means the results may differ from a real-world deployment. Although there has been progress in achieving improved search rings, reliably pinpointing specific buildings and floors remains unachieved and may continue to be challenging for the next 12-24 months. Future test campaigns are expected to validate the projected improvements of various technologies."}]}

These included U-TDOA Positioning by TruePosition, DAS Proximity-based Positioning by CommScope, AGNSS/WiFi/MEMS Sensor Hybrid Positioning by CSR, and LEO Iridium Satellite-based Positioning by Boeing BTL. Other technologies like WiFi-based Location and AGNSS were also noted as potential candidates for future stages. The recommendation is that future test bed stages should be chartered by the FCC and conducted in a controlled manner to support ongoing technology development. This would allow vendors who missed the initial phase, and other emerging technologies, to demonstrate their capabilities in improved indoor positioning."}]}
