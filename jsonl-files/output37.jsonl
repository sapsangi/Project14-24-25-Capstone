It is advisable to separate private networks by roles to maintain integrity. Having a large LAN for all computers and equipment management may increase risks, whereas segregating networks allows for better access control based on company policy, which mitigates risks by limiting the traffic types and sources. \nFor protecting data-at-rest, SMBs should implement basic procedures to ensure data protection, such as keeping data within isolated networks. For data-in-transit, protection should be enforced once it leaves secured networks, to prevent cybersecurity attacks. Utilizing encrypted VPN connections, encrypted virtual desktop connections, SSH, and SFTP is recommended for remote access. Avoid using standard FTP and Telnet due to their lack of protection for data in transit. \nFinally, configuration change control processes should be established, even if SMBs do not have dedicated staff for this. Communications providers should implement an informal or formal process to review proposed changes to make sure they align with company policy and cybersecurity standards. This shift in approach is crucial to integrating cybersecurity into the network configuration process."}]}
