One challenge is that vendors can be prohibitively expensive, and integration of their data can be costly and time-consuming. Contextual data is often missing; for example, an IP may be listed as bad without further information explaining why it is bad or how a service provider can determine if a detection is a false positive. \n\nIn terms of relationships, information is shared in both formal and informal settings, often from vendors or partners to the service provider (SP). This data can be communicated through conversations or emails and sometimes through formal reports. The timeliness can vary, with conversations being real-time and emails near real-time.\n\nThe information sharing process can differ based on the relationship between the ISP and the data source, as well as the data's nature. More sensitive data tends to be shared verbally, while less sensitive data might be shared via email or other electronic means.\n\nThe benefits of this information sharing include the prevention or identification of compromises, the revelation of vulnerabilities potentially before exploitation, and heightened awareness of threats. This information often emerges as warnings about known threats or as post-mortem analyses of incidents the SP has experienced. Overall, such sharing fosters a better understanding of threats as they relate to the SP environment."}]}
