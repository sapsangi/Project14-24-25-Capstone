While initial routing relies on coarse location from the carrier’s location platform, providing enhanced location information for emergency dispatch presents significant challenges, affected by both technical and non-technical factors."}]}

Each has specific standards and processes affecting the location technology architecture choices. Carrier-specific implementations also influence capabilities, such as whether they use control plane versus user plane location architectures. While coarse location can be accessible, enhanced location isn't universally available in SMS text-to-9-1-1. However, some carriers at the early stages of SMS text-to-9-1-1 deployment have enabled enhanced location, which may require UE firmware updates for certain networks. There are also limitations and challenges in providing enhanced location information within CMRS networks that must be considered."}]}

It often involves using the carrier's location platform and the communication network to relay enhanced location data to the Text Control Center (TCC) and Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). This may require changes in user equipment firmware, as firmware in wireless devices typically handles low-level functions and system operations. The method implemented will depend on network technology, carrier-specific choices, and compliance with relevant standards."}]}

The text messaging system was not originally designed with emergency services in mind, thus requiring some adaptations, but significant modifications to the system are currently not feasible. Key constraints include avoiding changes to E9-1-1 network entities, steering clear of firmware updates for devices already deployed by users due to compliance and usability issues, and not requiring changes to established 3GPP or 3GPP2 standards. Additionally, networks like LTE are considered out of scope as this area may be examined in future studies. Different architectural solutions exist for enhancing location information with SMS text to 9-1-1, though they are just examples of potential approaches."}]}

Network-based location determination refers to a technique that estimates the location of a handset using only the network elements, without considering the handset type. This method avoids device-specific behavior and can enhance the location estimate. On the other hand, handset-based location relies on the technology within the device itself to determine its position. Network-based methods such as U-TDOA and Radio Frequency Pattern Matching (RFPM) are examples that use network infrastructure to locate the device. U-TDOA, for instance, involves making time or power measurements on the radio interface, requiring the handset to transmit RF for a short duration, while RFPM uses UE measurements for server-based location determination."}]}

U-TDOA is deployed for GSM in the US but not for UMTS or CDMA, which would require LMUs and further software changes. CDMA networks primarily use handset-based location solutions for meeting FCC E9-1-1 rules and the ATIS/TIA J-STD-036 standard. Network-based solutions in CDMA would necessitate new MLP interfaces for location queries and additional messaging between network components like the HLR and MSC. Implementing these could disrupt current maintenance and sustainability of E9-1-1 systems."}]}

It effectively obtains coarse locations for routing to the appropriate PSAP. For enhanced location accuracy, users must download a location agent app on legacy UEs that supports cLBS location requests on behalf of the TCC. Newer UEs might have this agent pre-loaded, allowing OEMs to develop, test, and validate enhanced location functionality. However, users need to disable location privacy settings for location services to access user location. This approach is not compatible with all UE operating systems."}]}

Wireless carriers have started implementing enhanced location services, evident from partial rollouts of solutions. In the future, enhanced location services for SMS text to 9-1-1 could become more prevalent among some devices and networks. However, stakeholders are advised to focus on developing a universal next-generation solution. The FCC recommends prioritizing a standardized IP-based messaging solution like MMES because complex changes to network structures for SMS texts to 9-1-1 locations aren't practical. While voluntary development of location solutions is encouraged, the FCC acknowledges that some 2G/3G technologies might struggle more with these changes, so they should avoid enforcing strict Phase II location mandates on SMS text to 9-1-1 due to the transitional nature of these services."}]}

Unlike wireless E9-1-1 voice systems, cLBS platforms for texting are not subject to the same regulatory requirements, leading to variability in location accuracy depending on the carrier, location technology, and services used. Additionally, handset privacy settings often prevent cLBS applications from utilizing the location technologies used in E9-1-1 voice calls due to technical and legal privacy reasons. Furthermore, location estimates from cLBS platforms may lack the reliability or accuracy of those used in E9-1-1 voice calls as they are not under the same carrier control. Moreover, the current ATIS/TIA J-STD-110 standard does not define the conveyance of provider information, leading to inconsistencies in how such data is shared, which can be critical for emergency response.

Instead, emphasis should be placed on developing more robust MMES solutions based on LTE/IMS as Public Safety transitions towards NG9-1-1 solutions. Enhanced location information is deemed important for dispatching emergency services, and if available, should include confidence and uncertainty values, similar to wireless E9-1-1 voice calls. Lastly, carrier contact information, which is critical for resolving emergency situations, should be defined for SMS text to 9-1-1, as the current ATIS/TIA J-STD-110 standard does not provide for it.
