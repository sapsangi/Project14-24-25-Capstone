These programs should offer interns the chance to explore various cybersecurity functions, allowing them to appreciate the program's depth and breadth. Interns are also encouraged to aid in recruiting for future intern and permanent roles. In addition to internships, apprenticeships serve as an effective solution for recruiting, training, and retaining top talent. Programs like ApprenticeshipUSA provide the telecommunications industry with tools for establishing, monitoring, and growing successful apprenticeship schemes. WG7 recommends that industry members participate in existing partnerships or create work-study programs to develop cybersecurity skills tailored to their unique needs. Furthermore, scholarship for service programs can be considered, where students are given scholarships in exchange for committing to a period of service with a private employer after graduation."}]}
