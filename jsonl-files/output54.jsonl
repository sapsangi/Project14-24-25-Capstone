Typically, handsets remain in an always-on, idle condition. Users often turn off GPS for battery conservation. Therefore, a warm GPS start is more realistic than a cold start.

Generally, the sample size should not be too small, such as only 100 test calls, because smaller samples result in tighter order statistics pairs and reduce the likelihood of compliance. For urban, suburban, and some rural counties, typical sample sizes must be considerably larger, often resulting in order statistics pairs aligning closely with the 67th and 90th percentiles. A commonly used rule of thumb is to have 10 times the number of cell sites in the test area, but the minimum sample size should be at least 200 independent test calls in areas with very few sites.

One key concept is 'predictive testing', which utilizes predictive tools and models to determine location accuracy. This method aims to reduce reliance on resource-intensive field testing by augmenting empirical methods. Guidelines and safeguards for predictive testing are detailed in ATIS-0500001 Section 8. Another concept is 'incremental testing', which involves automatically collecting empirical test data gradually over time from test calls that include a ground-truth reference. These methods have been recommended by the Emergency Services Interconnection Forum (ESIF) and are summarized in ATIS-0500010."}]}

This method does not require a randomly uniform distribution for data collection. If an area is over-represented, a random sample may be selected from the collected data for analysis. It is important to note that the age of the incremental test data must not exceed two years, as outlined in ATIS-0500010: Maintenance Testing Section 3.2 and Section 3.3. This approach allows for a reduced sample size for subsequent testing, as initial empirical compliance testing establishes accuracy without prior knowledge of conformity. If conditions remain relatively unchanged, a smaller sample size can maintain the same level of statistical confidence, typically 90%."}]}

One such method is Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Monitoring, which entails establishing a baseline of various KPIs during initial compliance testing and continuously monitoring them to detect any changes that may indicate potential system issues. Useful KPIs include trends in uncertainty estimates, yield levels, latency, health checks, and alarms for equipment failure. These KPIs provide quicker insights into system performance problems than periodic field tests, allowing for timely interventions and improvements at the local level."}]}

Uncertainty estimate trending, while varied by service provider and technology, is endorsed by the FCC for monitoring ongoing accuracy without additional testing once baseline levels are established."}]}

In location system technologies, there are several triggers that prompt investigation. First, an increase in average location estimate latency can initiate a review, as these values typically do not vary much. Automated configuration database health checks are crucial; these help to detect missing or improper data rapidly. If location methods yield inconsistent results, such as differences between UTDOA and RTT estimates for the same 911 call, it's a strong indicator of underlying issues. Equipment failures are usually monitored via alarms for problems like loss of GPS or power failure, ensuring swift resolution. Lastly, testing technologies in representative environments, rather than every local area, can efficiently assess performance in those environments."}]}
