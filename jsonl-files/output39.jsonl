It is typically a point-to-point segment terminating in major cities (Tier 1 and Tier 2) with regeneration sites in between. Users of dark fiber are responsible for providing the necessary optronics to utilize it. It serves as a key infrastructure allowing for high-capacity data transmission across cities, often used by companies needing dedicated and secure network connections."}]}

When planning for disaster recovery using intercity and metro dark fiber, several considerations must be taken into account:\n\n1. **Recovery Route Availability**: It's essential to confirm whether potential recovery routes are available, as fiber may not be present on desired routes. Assess the total number of fibers required and the timeframes involved.\n\n2. **Handoff/Interconnect Locations**: Confirm potential handoff/interconnect locations from the impaired route to recovery routes. These locations are critical for redirecting traffic during recovery.\n\n3. **Distance Considerations**: The distances between fiber routes can be substantial. At times, these interconnect distances can exceed the length of the damaged route segment. Interconnect locations on intercity fibers are particularly limited.\n\n4. **Network Handoff Locations**: If a common fiber network handoff location doesn’t exist between companies, the time required for building and permitting could surpass the original repair timeframes.\n\n5. **Scope and Equipment**: Confirm the total scope of work before migrating to a potential recovery route. Ensure that all equipment, space, and power requirements for the duplicate route are met to prevent delays."}]}

A Network Provider had an ILA site damaged by a hurricane near New Orleans. They had access to intercity fibers on an alternate carrier route. However, due to the complexity of locating equipment, space, power requirements, provisioning, and installation, they chose to use a replacement ILA hut mounted on a trailer for recovery. This solution was quicker than using the shared fiber solution with the alternate carrier.\n\n2. Following a hurricane near New Orleans, a Network Provider ordered multiple 10G waves for temporary capacity for one year between New Orleans and Houston while the ILA site and damaged route were repaired.\n\n3. During floods in Northern Colorado, a telecom’s intercity dark fiber route was damaged north of Denver. Temporary fibers were available, but the telecom’s build timeframes were longer than the repair time on their own damaged fiber. Hence, they repaired their own route.\n\n4. A cable company affected by a tornado in Joplin, MO asked a network provider to confirm available fiber for recovery. However, no further details are provided in this case study."}]}]}

However, the available dark fiber and the cable company's build timeframes were not compatible.

It consists of an optical line terminal (OLT) at the service provider's central office and several optical network units (ONUs) near end users. PONs reduce the amount of fiber and central office equipment required compared to point-to-point architectures. They are advantageous in that they do not require active equipment in the outside plant, avoiding the need for powering remote nodes and reducing the risk of failures. This network type is suitable for closed campus environments and features improved energy efficiency for customer premises equipment."}]}
