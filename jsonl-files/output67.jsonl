First, service providers should implement policies for guiding responses to security breaches. Second, network operators and service providers should establish procedures for early recognition and isolation of potential bad actors to minimize the impact on the network. Third, service providers implementing control-signaled networks, such as SIP, should use media gateway controllers in accordance with industry standards like those from the IETF to ensure interoperability between IP Multimedia Core and Circuit Switched networks. Additionally, equipment suppliers should consider modifying support hotlines during major disasters to include specific entries for disaster response."}]}

It's recommended to add specific entries for disaster events in support 'hotline' calling trees. Equipment Suppliers should provide Service Providers with a 'Disaster Recovery Services Checklist' that includes professional services needed during an event. Additionally, Network Operators, Service Providers, and Equipment Suppliers should collaborate with government entities to establish criteria and procedures for handling network elements affected by serious incidents such as nuclear attacks or accidents. Implement the Incident Command System Standard for coordination and control during emergencies and ensure 'as-built' drawings of network sites are available to recovery teams."}]}
