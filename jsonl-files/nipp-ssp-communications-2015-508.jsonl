It helps define the requirements for NS/EP communications and enhances their survivability and resilience. At the operational level, the Communications Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Comm-ISAC) facilitates collaboration and information sharing between government and industry to support Executive Order 13618 and the national critical infrastructure protection goals outlined in Presidential Decision Directive 63. The Comm-ISAC, established in 1984, involves over 60 ICT companies and 24 Federal Government departments. It monitors incidents affecting emergency communications, responding under Emergency Support Function #2 of the National Response Framework, and collaborates with the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) for cyber infrastructure issues."}]}

They outline the objectives and activities of the Communications Sector to support national security and resilience. The sector may modify these activities to reflect evolving risks, changes in resources, and completed activities. The Joint priorities and objectives are mapped out over the four-year period, and a detailed report is created annually to ensure communication networks are secure, resilient, and rapidly restored after disasters."}]}

One key effort is the Sector Annual Report (SAR), which provides visibility into ongoing activities and risk management across the sector. It is developed with macro-level assurances and quantitative metrics on infrastructure availability, shared with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and similar agencies. This process encourages transparency and ensures that information is protected under CIPAC and PCII protocols. The SAR also includes qualitative examples, reflecting on past actions taken by Communications Sector members to address cyber threats."}]}

These include leveraging recommendations from the Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) and adopting best practices from national-level exercises and the Communication Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Comm-ISAC). They are also using the NIPP 2013's Call to Action (CtA) framework to track sector activity progress and report to the DHS's Office of Infrastructure Protection quarterly. This framework helps ensure continuous improvement in security and resilience through strategies such as setting national priorities, empowering local partnerships, and leveraging incentives."}]}
