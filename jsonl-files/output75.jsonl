Individual VoIP connections can be categorized into those with a registered static location and those that are nomadic. 'Voice Service Over Broadband' (VoBB) typically uses a registered static location where location determination methods are pre-established. However, current gaps in location accuracy exist. Nomadic VoBB allows users to utilize their service from various locations, which introduces challenges in real-time location determination methods. Over-the-Top (OTT) services provide a similar setup, working either from a static or nomadic broadband connection. The main issue here remains accurate deduced-method location services and the inherent lag in location accuracy, which can lead to significant gaps, especially in emergency scenarios. Each category requires different handling to ensure systems are robust in emergency alerts and correspondent actions. The advancements in technologies aim to bridge these gaps, enhancing accuracy and timely location-assisted responses in emergency systems."}]}

Firstly, they suggest that the FCC consider extending E9-1-1 and location obligations to providers of over-the-top VoIP applications that are not currently subject to Interconnected VoIP regulations. Public education is also recommended to specify the limitations of these over-the-top VoIP 9-1-1 applications. If 9-1-1 requirements are extended to these services, the ETAG should address technical challenges. \n\nFurthermore, CSRIC recommends that the FCC clarify whether existing wireless 9-1-1 rules apply to CMRS managed IMS based VoIP services. Instead of establishing separate location accuracy standards for IMS services, existing location technologies should continue to be used regardless of the transport core technology. For emerging technologies like femtocells and Unlicensed Mobile Access devices, they recommend developing standardized location data that can be easily interpreted by PSAPs, and further study under an ETAG until these standards are established. \n\nMoreover, CSRIC recommends that all providers, including new entrants, should have appropriate access to MSAG data for validation of customer-provided location information, and this should extend to future elements like the Location Information Server (LIS)."}]}

Wireless networks rely on solutions like AFLT, U-TDOA, RFPM, and D-TDOA that use signals from network elements and require an accurate database of base station locations and proper signal timing. These elements ensure the network's functionality, but their accuracy for location-based services (LBS) does not guarantee suitability for emergency services like 9-1-1. This is partly because some systems, like certain WiFi location services, are not maintained by controlled entities. Thus, new location technologies must meet several criteria, including integration with existing hardware, a feasible infrastructure deployment plan, and a maintenance strategy."}]}

This procedure ensures that the HNB is authorized to deliver services for the home operator. During initialization, critical information about the HNB is communicated with relevant entities within the operator's network, such as the HNB Management System (HMS), the HNB Gateway (HNB GW), and the associated switching elements (MSC or SGSN). The process also confirms that the HNB is located in a licensed area, usually by acquiring the HNB's location through standalone GPS. Once initialized, the HNB can provide authorized services to users.\n\nFor emergency calls initiated by a user accessing an HNB, the network may direct the device to switch to a macro cell, allowing location determination as with CMRS networks. If the call is placed via the HNB, it will proceed similarly to calls through macro or pico cells, albeit with different location determination methods. Currently, the location of the HNB during initialization is used to approximate the mobile device's location, though this may evolve with future solutions."}]}

This often requires the caller to verbally confirm their exact location, delaying emergency services dispatch until this information is obtained. If a Phase II location becomes available within 30 seconds, it can provide more precise data without negatively affecting response time. However, short call durations or timing issues can prevent this data from reaching PSAPs in time.
