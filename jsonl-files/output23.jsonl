The trunk group can deliver either a single or two 10-digit numbers along with the PSAP directory number, using specific SS7 parameters. The LSRG associates an Emergency Service Number (ESN)-appropriate pANI with the location information received from the routing proxy and checks if callback information needs to be signaled along with the pANI or location key.
