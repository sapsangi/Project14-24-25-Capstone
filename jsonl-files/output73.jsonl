A priority list for testing all major systems and subsystems can then be developed. It's important to customize testing and planning for each location, as plans for main facilities may not suit other locations.\n\nDevelop a schedule for testing each critical system and subsystem. For instance, schedule the 'loss of transmitter' test during nighttime to avoid traffic disruptions. Critical systems should be tested more frequently than ancillary subsystems. The Disaster Recovery Planning Manager might mandate 'loss of transmitter' testing every three months, whereas 'loss of air studio' testing could be once or twice a year, and 'loss of audio processing' less frequently. The entire Disaster Recovery Plan should be reviewed at least annually.\n\nSome tests, like emergency generator power systems, should be conducted routinely and tested annually by completely disconnecting from the utility power grid. This ensures all critical systems are linked to the appropriate emergency backup power supply. For example, a local station performing monthly UPS and emergency power tests assumed they would pass their annual full-power disconnect test. All systems operated correctly except for the main newsroom, which was dark due to its lighting being connected to the wrong power source. This issue would have gone unnoticed without such a test."}]}

When planning and testing a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP), it's important to announce major system testing in advance, typically 7 to 10 days, so that proper preparations can be made. For example, ensure technology support has all data systems fully backed up and redundant. If a main transmitter system is tested, have the backup transmitter ready in case the primary fails. Consider creating an annual testing schedule to aid in planning maintenance and upgrades. During actual disasters, keep a complete event log for review and improvement of recovery efforts. Additionally, identify critical systems and their vulnerabilities to develop a corresponding testing plan. Examples include using a backup transmitter site if the primary is lost, relocating operations to a newsroom if the air studio is lost, or moving to a remote studio if the building needs evacuation."}]}

An annual schedule of systems and subsystems testing can also aid engineering and operations personnel in planning maintenance tasks around these tests. Maintaining a complete event log during an actual disaster is crucial for reviewing recovery efforts and improving procedures. Critical systems are identified and categorized by priority to create a DRP testing strategy. Examples of test scenarios include loss of uplink service, customer service center, building evacuation, and critical system data. Each test scenario should consider the complexity, time for execution and debriefing, and the impact on normal operations.
