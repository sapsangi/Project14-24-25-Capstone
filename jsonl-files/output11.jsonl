These efforts are guided by the R&D Planning Process outlined in the Communications Sector-Specific Plan (CSSP) of 2010. Additionally, incident response and recovery efforts primarily occur at community and regional levels, involving cross-sector collaboration among regional asset operators. On a federal level, the Communications Sector ensures continuous communication through NS/EP services like the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS), Wireless Priority Service (WPS), and the Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) Program, which provide prioritized restoration and provisioning of services during and after emergencies."}]}

This partnership, established in 1984, involves over 60 private sector ICT companies and 24 Federal Government departments and agencies. These participants include communications equipment and software vendors, wireline and wireless providers, satellite providers, and more. The Comm-ISAC, in conjunction with the National Coordinating Center (NCC), continuously monitors national and international incidents impacting emergency communications, including terrorism and natural disasters. During emergencies, the NCC Watch leads response and recovery efforts under Emergency Support Function #2 of the National Response Framework."}]}
