The Domain Name System (DNS) is like a directory for the internet, translating human-friendly domain names into IP addresses. Each autonomously managed domain is called a zone, and the DNS is distributed across numerous geographically dispersed nameservers, managed by independent organizations. These nameservers store data in resource records (RRs). There are authoritative servers, which have complete knowledge about a subset of the domain namespace, and caching servers, which improve query response time by locally storing data temporarily. DNS operates on a client-server model. User devices have a resolver that sends and receives DNS queries. Whenever a URL is entered, the resolver checks its local cache for the domain's IP address. If not available, it queries designated DNS nameservers to resolve the domain to its IP address."}]}

If the server isn't configured with DNS recursion, it sends a referral to another nameserver, and the resolver queries this server iteratively until the IP address and resource record are obtained. If configured with recursion, the server acts as an agent, recursively querying other nameservers till it gathers the information from the system and passes it back to the resolver. Initially, the entity wanting to use a domain name must register it, becoming the 'registrant'. ISPs can register domain names to provide their services. Over 300 top-level domains exist globally, including those for specific countries and several generic TLDs."}]}

In the domain registration process, several key players are involved: \n1. **Domain Name Registry**: This organization manages the database of domain names within a specific Top Level Domain (TLD), publishes these domains into the DNS, and oversees various domain-related operations. \n2. **Registrar**: This is a broker organization that helps registrants register a domain. They collect the necessary information and payment, and work with the registry to publish the domain in the DNS. Registrars also aid registrants in updating DNS data and managing contact details (whois data). \n3. **Registrant**: This is the entity or individual that registers a domain name. They use a registrar's services to manage their domain name registration, payment, and whois data. \nIn the generic TLD space, registrars operate under contracts with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). For country code TLDs, country code managers are involved, and they might not always adhere to ICANN's accreditation for registrars."}]}
