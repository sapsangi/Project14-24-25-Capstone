Additionally, while the President can use the Defense Production Act (DPA) for national defense needs, it does not mandate preferential treatment of network packets. The Communications Act of 1934 provides jurisdiction over PSTN and telecommunications services, but not explicitly for Internet-based services.

On the technology front, the OMNCS should push for integrating the Emergency Telecommunications Service in standards bodies and ensure international ETS traffic is accounted for. They should also collaborate with organizations developing next-gen wireless standards to meet NS/EP requirements and encourage industry testing for interoperability between packet networks and the PSTN."}]}

The FCC should task the NRIC to evaluate these interoperability aspects. Additionally, the OMNCS and the GSA are advised to incorporate economic analysis into their assessments of emerging technologies' impact on NS/EP telecommunications. Industry collaboration to develop performance and security metrics for cost-effective NS/EP solutions in NGN is encouraged. The FCC and OMNCS are actively working on implementing CWG report recommendations despite funding challenges, consistent with the rapid NGN technology evolution."}]}
