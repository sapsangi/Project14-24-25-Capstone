It determines the best paths for data transmission across diverse networks. Originally, both DNS and BGP were developed without strong security features, but they have evolved to address these shortcomings through heuristics, best current practices, and cryptographic extensions.

Additionally, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that allocate address spaces to customers should register and maintain the accuracy of these assignments with Internet Routing Registries (IRRs) as necessary. Furthermore, operators of an Autonomous System (AS) should ensure their number resources are certified with the relevant regional Internet registry."}]}
