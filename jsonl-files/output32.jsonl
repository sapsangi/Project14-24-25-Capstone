The cable owner reimburses staff time for these activities. For areas where the seabed is owned by a local jurisdiction, a similar process is undertaken by that local entity. Following this, the California Coastal Commission carries out its own review. Only after these reviews and the incorporation of any necessary mitigation measures will the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) perform their review and suggest additional mitigations if needed. This process typically takes about two years to complete. Similarly, in Oregon, the Department of State Lands leads the environmental review process, with ACOE commenting at the project's end. Both states require periodic re-inspections of the cable as part of the State Lands Lease condition, generally every 2-5 years, to verify burial. Local permitting also involves road and beach opening permits, compliance with noise, water, and air pollution regulations, and easement acquisitions."}]}

This system is a patchwork of federal, state, local, and tribal regulations, often industry-specific, lacking a unified framework for protecting submarine cables. Unlike countries such as Australia and New Zealand, the U.S. lacks a robust regime that emphasizes the economic and national-security significance of submarine cables. This fragmentation leads to coordination problems such as gaps in legal authorities, lack of familiarity with submarine cable operations, and unclear consultation procedures among agencies. Addressing these issues requires enhancing coordination without adding more regulatory burdens, encouraging early and broad stakeholder engagement in new marine actions."}]}

It's also illegal for fishing vessels to interfere with cable ships or buoys marking a cable when using nets. However, existing U.S. statutes do not mandate consideration of cable protection when reviewing new uses near submarine cables. While NEPA requires environmental impact analysis of new marine uses that may affect the environment broadly defined, its effectiveness as a cable protection tool is limited. Some jurisdictions, such as Oregon, may require specific cable protection analyses, but marine spatial planning generally lacks the integration of these considerations."}]}

While these cables are crucial for safety and national security, they may not be thoroughly analyzed under NEPA unless raised by commentators or identified by agencies. NEPA serves more as a procedural statute with no substantive requirements for choosing alternatives that minimize impacts specifically on telecommunications. Therefore, its utility as a protection tool for telecom infrastructure is limited. Agencies have room to coordinate and revise processes to better include telecom impacts in environmental analyses."}]}

These statutes present similar advantages and disadvantages as NEPA when it comes to cable protection. Typically, authorization of marine activities that potentially impact submarine cables requires agency approvals under various federal and state permitting statutes. However, many of these regulations do not specifically require the identification of submarine cables or coordination with cable operators and other agencies. Therefore, it is crucial to identify cables early in the project conceptualization and site identification stages to avoid potentially significant adverse interactions."}]}
