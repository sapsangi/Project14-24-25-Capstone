Common data classifications include:\n\n1. **HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL**: This classification is for the most sensitive business information intended strictly for internal use. Unauthorized disclosure could seriously affect your company, business partners, vendors, and customers. Examples include credit-card transaction data, customer names and addresses, card magnetic stripe contents, passwords and PINs, employee payroll files, Social Security numbers, and patient information (for healthcare businesses).\n\n2. **SENSITIVE**: This classification covers sensitive business information meant for internal use and private information. It includes employee performance evaluations, internal audit reports, financial reports, product designs, partnership agreements, marketing plans, and email marketing lists.\n\n3. **INTERNAL USE ONLY**: This is for sensitive information generally accessible by a broad internal audience, intended only for company use. While unauthorized disclosure to outsiders is against policy and may be harmful, it is not expected to significantly impact the company or related parties.\n\nControlling access to your data is crucial regardless of its classification. The more sensitive the data, the more restrictive the access should be. Access should be on a need-to-know basis, with only those having a specific need allowed access."}]}

To ensure compliance, consider mandatory archiving at the end of the retention cycle and automatic deletion after 180-360 days in archives. Avoiding personal folders on employee computers helps manage company standards. Additionally, developing an email usage policy is crucial. This policy should outline appropriate uses, data transmission rules, and address retention, privacy, and acceptable use. It should also detail the rights of the business and users regarding email monitoring. The policy should be easy to read, part of end-user training, and reviewed annually.
