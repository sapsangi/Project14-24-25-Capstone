When setting up firewalls and load balancers for DNS operations, you'll need to ensure that both UDP and TCP traffic on port 53 is permitted, as DNS can use both protocols. It's also important to confirm that these devices can handle larger DNS responses because traditional UDP responses are typically up to 512 bytes, but with EDNS0, they can be up to 4,000 bytes. Additionally, routers, firewalls, and load balancers should properly manage any potential fragmentation from larger queries or responses, including recursion-related traffic. Consideration should also be given to the ISP’s DNS server software version and its support for DNSSEC, as upgrades may be necessary. If DNS recursive resolvers have validation turned on, this can increase CPU utilization, potentially affecting the server's capacity to handle peak queries per second, which might require scaling up the server infrastructure. As more domains are signed, the average query size and frequency might increase, impacting the ISP's capacity planning and necessitating further investments in DNS server capacity."}]}

It's crucial to determine whether there is an automated process or standard interface for submitting these records, or if manual processing by ISP or registrar personnel is required. Additionally, ISPs with numerous zones to sign and keys to roll over need automated software tools to ensure a successful DNSSEC deployment. This involves selecting authoritative DNS software that can perform signing activities efficiently."}]}

Some authoritative DNS software can perform signing activities, although it may require a version upgrade. If a DNS software lacks efficient signing capabilities, additional functional components might be necessary. Both open-source and commercial signing services are vital to address these needs. It’s important to note that automated signing can be resource-intensive, potentially requiring additional DNS server capacity. The processes for signing domains, managing chaining to subdomains, and updating DS records are complex and should be carefully planned, especially for large, complex, or mission-critical domains."}]}

This helps to stay informed about DNS issues and seek assistance with DNSSEC problems. ISPs already tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) related to DNS servers may find it beneficial to track DNSSEC validation failure rates as well. Alarms could be set to trigger above certain failure thresholds, alerting engineers to issues that require investigation. ISPs might proactively contact domain owners to assist in problem resolution, as some have started doing in recent years. In certain cases, the implementation of a negative trust anchor could be considered."}]}

Negative trust anchors are used on a case-by-case basis, and their implementation depends on the ISP's DNS software capabilities. Additionally, ISPs should monitor server CPU utilization to ensure that migration to DNSSEC does not exceed query response capacity, and they may need to adjust capacity planning accordingly."}]}

This restores access to the domain for customers while the issue is corrected by the domain's administrator. However, this approach is not scalable for long-term use.\n\nISPs should also update their customer education materials, including FAQs, to discourage switching to non-validating resolvers in case of a DNSSEC validation failure. Such failures may indicate security risks, like malware infections or compromised login credentials.\n\nISPs are encouraged to use diagnostic tools such as DNSViz and DNSSEC Debugger to investigate and diagnose DNSSEC validation failures.

It's been noted that of the top nine queries detected in these alarms, six were DNSSEC-enabled. Interestingly, a query for www.microsoft.com was identified as a false-positive detection unrelated to actual attack activities. This data highlights the substantial risk posed by DNS amplification attacks and the importance of distinguishing legitimate traffic from potential threats."}]}
