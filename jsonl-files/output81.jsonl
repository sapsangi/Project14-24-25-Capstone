It's suggested that in the Automatic Location Identification (ALI) subscriber name field, the IP/VRS company name along with 'Relay Caller' can be used to alert the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) call taker. This alert initiates the appropriate Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for handling relay calls, including expecting translation delays. Furthermore, the IP/VRS interpreter can immediately introduce themselves after the PSAP's greeting before interpreting back to the 9-1-1 caller, ensuring the call is not mistaken for an abandoned call."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What should be done to ensure best practices regarding 9-1-1 calls in a VoIP environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "CSRIC Working Group 4B is advised to use the input from WG 4A to update existing Network Reliability and Interoperability Council (NRIC) Best Practices.

These issues include:\n\n1) ESQK Provisioning - ESQKs requested by VPCs are not accurately provisioned in the ILEC network, leading to E9-1-1 calls being routed incorrectly or not at all.\n2) 10-digit PSAP Backup Numbers - VPCs may lack accurate 10-digit numbers for PSAPs to receive VoIP calls when E9-1-1 routing fails, as these numbers are unique and not necessarily the published emergency or non-emergency numbers.\n3) ESGW Provisioning - There is a risk of congestion and service blockage when VoIP services and legacy calls are combined on the same paths due to ESGW provisioning issues.\n4) VoIP Mobile Application Routing - Some VoIP mobile applications fail to provide location data for automatic 9-1-1 call routing, resulting in calls being sent to call centers or the application doing nothing.\n5) VSP Nomadic Backup Routing - Incorrect routing occurs when a VSP uses wireless networks for backup routing without a subscriber-provisioned address, which also fails to provide callback numbers."}]}
