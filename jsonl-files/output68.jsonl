This required EAS participants to accept messages using the OASIS Standard, Common Alerting Protocol Version 1.2. Further, the Fourth Report & Order on November 18, 2010, set a deadline for EAS participants to begin receiving CAP messages by June 30, 2012. The Fifth Report and Order on January 10, 2012, clarified the processes for receiving and transmitting CAP messages and streamlined the Part 11 rules.

This was aimed at ensuring rapid and efficient dissemination of alerts across multiple formats and channels. On May 25, 2011, a Third FNPRM was adopted to seek public input on proposed revisions to integrate CAP into Part 11 rules. The Fourth Report and Order was adopted on November 18, 2010, amending the rules to require the receipt of CAP alerts by June 30, 2012.

Additionally, there was a discrepancy between FCC standards and FEMA IPAWS guidance regarding audio file types for CAP EAS messaging. While the FCC's revised rules incorporated allowance for both mp3 and wav formats per the ECIG Implementation Guide, FEMA IPAWS constrained audio encoding to mp3 only for messages distributed through IPAWS, specifying constraints on mono, 64 kbit/s data, and sampling rates. These constraints do not apply to EAS messages from other sources, and all known CAP EAS equipment manufacturers support mp3 format."}]}

However, alert origination systems may be affected if they do not support generating MP3 formatted audio. Regarding authentication, the group recommends that any CAP messages intended for dissemination via the IPAWS aggregator should include a digest element as per the CAP 1.2 standard. The digest, an optional element in the CAP 1.2 standard, uses the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) for generating a hash for authentication purposes. It is further recommended that this digest element should be required when a resource element is referenced in a CAP message."}]}

They also recommended specifying MP3 as the only acceptable audio file type for CAP EAS messaging.
