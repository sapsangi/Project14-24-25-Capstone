For instance, slanted bar charts use the slant to represent the uncertainty of a data point, typically to a 95% confidence level, which is standard for statistical testing. If the slanted areas of two bars overlap, it implies that one can't definitively say one is larger than the other. Spaghetti charts include time elements and use individual threads to show possible values within a confidence interval. Looser threads indicate a wider confidence interval and smaller sample sizes. Dot plots represent organizations with dots, where each dot can represent a certain percentage of organizations, providing insight into distribution. Each chart type visually conveys the uncertainty inherent in industry data in its own unique way."}]}

For example, an 'Action' feature can include 'Social,' 'Malware,' and 'Hacking,' leading to percentages that don't sum to 100%. This is normal since each value can represent multiple actions across different incidents. For instance, in a sample of five botnet breaches, each breach might involve phishing (Social), installation of keyloggers (Malware), and use of stolen credentials (Hacking). This results in 300% combined actions, which is expected and correctly managed in analysis and tools. Also, 'unknown' values denote 'unmeasured' elements, indicating that if a record contains 'unknowns,' it’s not possible to make definitive statements about those elements."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant specialized in data analysis and bias in data collection and reporting."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What can you tell me about sampling bias in data breaches?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sampling bias is a common issue in data collection, including the analysis of data breaches. Despite efforts to collect breaches from a variety of contributors to achieve the 'best obtainable version of the truth,' certain types of breaches - such as those that are publicly disclosed - are more represented in our data. Classified or non-disclosed breaches are less likely to appear in the dataset. This leads to an uneven distribution, which is visualized using radial axes representing different data contributors. Ideally, these axes should show a roughly even distribution, but often, a few contributors provide a significant amount of data while many others contribute less. This can lead to bias, especially where axes are represented by fewer contributors. However, with multiple large contributors on most axes, the impact of this bias can be somewhat mitigated. Understanding and acknowledging this bias is crucial to analyzing the data accurately."}]}

To mitigate such biases, data is collected from diverse sources and reviewed multiple times, involving subject matter experts. Incidents are categorized in subsets based on quality and relevance. For instance, subsets might include incidents like web server takeovers or botnet-related activities. These are analyzed separately to avoid overshadowing smaller trends. Non-incident data, like malware or DDoS, which doesn't fit incident categories, is also analyzed, often having larger sample sizes but fewer sources. This structured approach ensures clarity and thoroughness in the reports."}]}
