These usually only affect users within the censoring association or country. DNS takedowns are another method with a global impact, preventing a domain name from being resolved to its IP address. However, the domain could still be accessible by its IP address directly. \n\nRouting-based methods, on the other hand, can prevent an IP prefix from being reachable by large parts of the internet. This can be done by compelling an ISP to stop forwarding IP packets to a targeted address. The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) could potentially increase the risk of these actions, as it is a system used to secure the internet's routing infrastructure but could also be used to enforce these blocks."}]}

The impact largely depends on how ISPs throughout the Internet use RPKI data in their routing decisions. According to the RFCs, it is a matter of ‘local policy’ how ISPs consume RPKI information. Some plausible local policies include: using RPKI to decide whether to originate a prefix, assigning lower preference to BGP-learned routes classified as 'invalid', or filtering such routes entirely. Thus, the effects of RPKI invalidation can vary significantly based on these local policies."}]}

One major issue is the potential impact of RPKI invalidation on prefix reachability, which can vary based on router policies. In particular, routers with a strict 'drop invalid' policy will altogether prevent prefixes from being reachable via BGP if they are invalidated. Given that RPKI deployment was still in its early stages at that time, the exact policies ASes would use were uncertain, making it challenging to quantify the impact of misinformation on prefix reachability.\n\nRecommendations to mitigate RPKI risks include exploring ways to monitor and audit modifications of RPKI databases, improving transparency of RPKI data, and ensuring synchronization between allocation data and RPKI data. The design of RPKI does not standardize the inclusion of identity data in resource certificates to avoid redundancies and potential legal concerns. This lack of transparency could pose issues if maintaining tight synchronization between allocation and RPKI data becomes difficult."}]}

These contacts are responsible for the operations of the CAs. Additionally, deploying tools to prevent misconfigurations is critical. Such tools should validate new RPKI information against existing BGP routing tables to avoid creating invalid routes and provide alerts before certificate expiration. Monitoring changes in RPKI data can also help detect manipulations, with emphasis on detailed logging and auditing modifications, and the (re)issuing of ROAs."}]}

The community can make progress by defining clearly-defined metrics for characterizing security incidents and using these metrics to detect suspicious routes and their possible causes.

BGP security is critical to maintaining the accuracy and reliability of internet routing.

Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) are an important part of this, as they help ensure that an IP block is being legitimately advertised by a specific ASN. By maintaining and auditing ROAs, organizations can track and verify routing integrity, allowing the BGP security community to monitor and reduce 'unknown' or 'invalid' routes.

These policies can be complex and are dictated by the business relationships and interconnections of the AS. Routes can have their attributes changed multiple times as they are processed by routers, and policies decide if a route is propagated, accepted, or rejected. This capability is flexible but can introduce vulnerabilities due to the lack of standardization across AS interconnections."}]}

Hijacking of unused IP space: This involves repetitive hijacks of routes to prefixes within large IP blocks assigned to entities such as the US government that are normally not routed on the public Internet. Using these 'unused' addresses temporarily enables criminal or antisocial activities (e.g., spam, network attacks) while complicating detection and diagnosis of the perpetrators.\n\n2. Surgically targeted hijacks: These target specific routes and conduct deaggregation attacks on specific IP addresses. These may be hard to identify unless anomaly detection is clear, or if the victim is significant enough to draw attention. A historical example is when Pakistan inadvertently black-holed YouTube’s traffic globally.\n\n3. Unambiguous massive hijacks: In these cases, many legitimate origin Autonomous Systems (ASes) are replaced by an unauthorized origin AS advertising the hijacked routes. Notable incidents include the 'China's 18-minute Mystery' in 2010 and the TTNet hijack in 2004.
