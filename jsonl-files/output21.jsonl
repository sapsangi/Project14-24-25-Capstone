Additionally, the LSRG must pass a key for location information associated with the emergency call to the Selective Router (SR). This might involve populating the SS7 Calling Party Number parameter with either the location key or callback information, with the location key possibly assigned to the SS7 Generic Digits Parameter. An egress LSRG should generate a 10-digit pseudo Automatic Number Identification (pANI) to link with the location data obtained from the NG Emergency Services Network. If both callback and pANI numbers are provided to the SR, per-PSAP provisioning will determine what gets signaled forward. The PSAP uses this information to query an ALI (Automatic Location Identification) system for caller location, which directs the query back to the LSRG akin to queries to MPC/GMLC in wireless networks. The LSRG must support the interface protocol used by ALI systems to query an MPC/GMLC, with the pANI serving as the location query key, potentially in conjunction with the callback information."}]}
