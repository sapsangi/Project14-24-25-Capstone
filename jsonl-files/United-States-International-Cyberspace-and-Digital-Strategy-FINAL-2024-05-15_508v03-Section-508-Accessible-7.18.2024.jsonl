The U.S. promotes technology standards for AI risk management and content authentication. NIST has developed algorithms to withstand quantum attacks and is working with the Department of State on internationalizing these cryptographic standards."}]}

This initiative is partly a response to cyberattacks against countries like Ukraine, Costa Rica, and Albania, which highlighted the need for threat intelligence sharing and operational collaboration with allies. The U.S. is also modernizing its authorities for technology-related foreign assistance to ensure it can respond at the necessary speed and scale. To support these efforts, Congress established the Cyberspace, Digital Connectivity, and Related Technologies Fund through the Department of State Authorization Act of 2023 and funded it via the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Program Appropriations Act, 2024. This fund will enable the Department of State to support strategically important cyber, digital, and technology-related foreign assistance programs, advancing U.S. foreign policy and fostering digital solidarity."}]}

Prior to the Russian invasion, agencies like the FBI and U.S. Cyber Command shared intelligence with Ukraine. Post-invasion, more than $100 million in cyber assistance has been delivered. Additionally, the Tallinn Mechanism was established in 2023 to enhance donor coordination in Ukraine. For Costa Rica, following a series of ransomware attacks, the U.S. announced a $25 million package to improve cybersecurity infrastructure. This includes setting up a centralized security operations center with the Costa Rican Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology, and Telecommunications."}]}

In Costa Rica, the U.S. is backing medium- and long-term technical projects and workforce development to build a secure, resilient, and sustainable cyber ecosystem. In Albania, after a request from the Prime Minister in 2022 following a significant cyberattack attributed to Iran, the U.S. deployed technical teams to assist. This resulted in a coordinated diplomatic campaign, U.S. sanctions, and NATO and EU condemnations. Further long-term capacity-building efforts include over $50 million in U.S. assistance to Albania's civilian and military sectors to strengthen their networks. This assistance is ongoing, with continued collaboration between U.S. agencies and Albanian cyber authorities to counter additional cyber threats."}]}

Firstly, it centers on fostering responsible state behavior in cyberspace and enhancing states' cyber threat management capacities. Secondly, the Department of State leverages the Cyberspace, Digital Connectivity, and Related Technologies Fund to provide both rapid incident response and long-term capacity building. This approach aims to strengthen the U.S. role as a digital partner and encourage host countries to invest in their cybersecurity and digital transformation. Going forward, the United States emphasizes advancing economic prosperity, enhancing security, protecting human rights, and addressing transnational challenges through digital technologies. The Department of State commits to extending digital solidarity globally and aligning data governance strategies while promoting innovation in critical technologies, all to foster a secure and equitable world."}]}
