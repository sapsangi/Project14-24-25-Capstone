It affects a broad range of connected products such as baby monitors, smartwatches, firewalls, routers, and more. The CRA requires that these products, whether supplied by EU companies or external ones, meet certain cybersecurity standards when introduced to the EU market. Essentially, any product that has digital elements and connects to a network falls under the CRA, which includes various consumer electronics like smart TVs, streaming devices, smart speakers, wearables, gaming consoles, and many others. Approximately 90% of consumer electronics are expected to fall under a default category with less stringent requirements compared to specialized Class I products."}]}

Does the CRA impact my product?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the CRA will likely impact your security software if it plays a critical role in protecting other devices or systems. Software like Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions and anti-virus software fall under Class I - Critical Products with Digital Elements. This category has stricter security requirements compared to the default category."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What about hardware components used in security systems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Microprocessors with security-related functionalities will fall under Class I. Tamper-resistant microprocessors will be classified as Class II - Highly Critical Products with Digital Elements. This last category carries the most stringent security requirements under the CRA."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What specific requirements does the CRA impose on OEMs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The exact requirements are still being finalized, but the CRA is expected to mandate security measures throughout a product's lifecycle, from design and development to production and post-sale support. This likely includes secure coding practices, vulnerability testing, patch management, and end-of-life support."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How will the CRA impact product development timelines and costs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While there may be some initial costs associated with implementing new security measures, the CRA is designed to ultimately reduce security risks and vulnerabilities. This can lead to fewer product recalls, warranty claims, and reputational damage in the long run."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What resources are available to help OEMs comply with the CRA?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Regulatory bodies are expected to provide guidance documents and resources to help manufacturers understand and comply with the CRA. Industry associations and cybersecurity firms are also likely to offer compliance assistance programs."}]}

However, there is a grace period before the official requirements come into effect. Manufacturers, importers, and distributors will have 36 months to adapt to the new requirements after the CRA officially enters into force, which is expected sometime between April and June of 2027."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is there a shorter grace period for any specific CRA requirements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, there is a shorter grace period of 21 months for the obligation for manufacturers to report incidents and vulnerabilities. This means this specific requirement is expected to come into effect between January and April of 2026."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does the CRA apply to different categories of risk within my product line?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The specific requirements of the CRA may vary depending on the risk profile of your product. Products considered to be critical infrastructure or those that handle sensitive data may have stricter security requirements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How can I ensure my supply chain partners are also CRA compliant?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The CRA may require you to implement measures to ensure the security practices of your suppliers. This could involve conducting security audits of your supply chain or requiring suppliers to demonstrate their own CRA compliance."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What happens if I fail to comply with the CRA?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Failure to comply with the CRA can lead to hefty penalties such as fines and product recalls, determined by the non-compliance severity. Violations of essential security requirements could result in a fine between EUR 5-15m or 1-2.5% of the previous financial year's global turnover, whichever is higher."}]}
