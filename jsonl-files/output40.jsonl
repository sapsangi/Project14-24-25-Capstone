Although protected ring configurations are often implemented to provide redundancy, hardening all fiber access nodes remains a sound engineering practice to mitigate risk.\n\nRisk management also requires understanding the frequency and duration of commercial power failures. More than half of these outages last less than one hour, which is a helpful initial step in forming a risk management strategy. It might be tempting to disregard longer outages due to their infrequency, but they can have a significant impact on service reliability without adequate backup power. In contrast, shorter outages pose a lower threat and can usually be addressed with battery backups.

In contrast, code regulations and wiring methods for DC distribution are often non-existent or poorly understood. This makes AC generators the logical choice and effectively eliminates DC generators and fuel cells that produce a DC output from shared standby power application consideration. If DC generation is necessary, inverters can be employed to convert DC to AC, but they introduce a single point of failure, which can diminish system resiliency."}]}

To mitigate this, N+1 or 2N architectures can be implemented, though at increased cost and complexity.\n\n2. **Energy Efficiency**: Shared AC systems combined with redundancy architectures (N+1 or 2N) can have lower utilization, reducing energy efficiency further.\n\n3. **Generator Type**: An AC generator is generally preferred over a DC generator that requires an inverter, due to efficiency and design logic.\n\n4. **Cooling Systems**: For DC power, the requirement for DC-powered cooling is necessary, which may not be feasible for all carriers sharing the site.\n\nThere are two main design options for stationary shared AC standby systems:\n\n- **Recommended Design**: Uses a shared stationary standby generator with an individual Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) for each tenant. This is prevalent among existing sites.\n\n- **Alternate Design**: Utilizes a single ATS for a new site without existing infrastructure, connecting to a Main Distribution Panel with tenant-specific breakers.

When deploying portable shared standby power systems, consider the following:\n\n1. **Multiple Plug and Cord Interfaces**: Use a variety of compatible plug and cord interfaces, such as Cam-Lok, Appleton, and Hubbell. Document the type of generator plug used at each site and ensure that a predefined set of cords and adapters is available to make necessary connections. This prevents the need for an electrician during emergency events.\n\n2. **Service Sizes vs. Actual Load**: Evaluate the service sizes in comparison to actual load requirements. Though service sizes might be rated at 240V 200A per carrier, the actual load could be significantly lower (10-20%). Over-sizing generators to 200 kW when actual needs are only 20-40 kW might lead to inefficiencies.\n\n3. **Fuel Reserve**: Portable generators typically have limited fuel tank capacity. This necessitates frequent refueling, which may not be feasible during extended natural disasters. Consider the practicality of the refueling process and the logistical challenges involved.\n\n4. **Site Access**: In times of widespread natural disasters, road closures and checkpoints can idle your fleet of portable generators.

Carriers generally deploy generators ranging from 35-50 kW, with an expected continuous load of 28-40kW. Oversizing generators primarily leads to economic inefficiencies if the load isn't sufficient to prevent wet stacking and the fuel isn't consumed promptly. If a generator is undersized, it may not function properly, prompting measures like load sequencing or shedding, and ultimately requiring replacement due to load growth. Proper generator sizing balances between economic impacts and the potential need for future upgrades. Shared portable generator arrangements require detailed agreements, including load sequencing protocols, to manage loads efficiently among carriers. Shared stationary standby generators, dealing with multiple carriers, need conservative yet accurate power estimates to avoid oversizing while covering the power needs of all involved."}]}

It's important to understand the actual load per carrier to ensure the generator is appropriately sized to handle the inrush current, especially from multiple HVAC compressors starting simultaneously. Oversizing can lead to economic and environmental downsides such as increased invested capital, wasted fuel, fuel degradation, wet stacking, and higher maintenance costs. For instance, a generator owner might size the generator for four carriers, with each assumed to have a 40 kW continuous load, resulting in a 200 kW generator. However, if only one or two carriers sign on, with a total load of 40 kW, it could take years to consume the fuel, risking degradation. ASTM rates diesel fuel stability at one year, so fuel stabilizing additives or periodic fuel replacement might be necessary to ensure reliability."}]}

However, larger fuel tanks might require compliance with environmental and hazardous material storage regulations. It is common to round up to the next standard size tank, but in shared generator scenarios where load uncertainty exists, it may be better to right-size the tank or keep it partially filled under normal conditions to prevent issues like fuel degradation and condensation-related water accumulation.

Important factors include matching fuel supply, refueling capabilities, and standby power sources to the site's environmental and regulatory conditions. For example, in areas prone to flooding, like the New Orleans 'bowl' area, it is prudent to install equipment and standby generators on elevated platforms above the expected flood plain.

Often, refineries add the blend without customer notification. However, blends higher than B5 should generally be avoided due to concerns about long-term storage, cold weather performance, algae growth, and potential warranty issues. For more details, refer to the U.S. DOE NREL 'Biodiesel: Handling and Use Guidelines,' Fourth Edition, January 2009.\n\n2. **Gasoline:** While gasoline is highly flammable and more prone to theft, it is also toxic to the environment if spilled. Due to these risks, gasoline-fueled generators are typically not recommended for telecommunications standby applications.\n\n3. **Natural Gas (NG):** NG-fueled generators eliminate the need for refueling but are rarely available at remote cell sites, making them less viable in rural areas. Additionally, NG supply may be cut off by fire officials after seismic events or other emergencies. Their disruptions are usually local rather than regional, making NG a viable choice in non-seismic urban and suburban areas where available.\n\n4. **Propane:** Propane offers a viable alternative, especially where available. A buried propane tank with cathodic protection is recommended to prevent vandalism and protect against storm surge, assuming flooding subsides before refueling is necessary. Many generators run on either NG or propane, making propane a backup fuel source for NG."}]}
