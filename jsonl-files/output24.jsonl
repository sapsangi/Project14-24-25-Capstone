This trust system worked effectively for a long time. However, with the expansion of mobility and global roaming, more carriers now have access to the SS7 network. This growth has led to evolving security threats as the ecosystem expanded. In contrast, Diameter, which has been subject to recent threat assessments, also faces vulnerabilities. Industry experts like Segey Mashukov of Positive Technologies and Cathal McDaid of AdaptiveMobile have pointed out that while the majority of Diameter traffic is legitimate, reported vulnerabilities and exploitations still require coordinated industry research and action to ensure network security."}]}

However, deregulatory measures like the U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 opened up networks, lowering barriers to SS7 access. This increased access, while beneficial for competition and new services, expanded the attack surface for potential exploitation. The transition to IP transport in 2000 further simplified network connections, inviting more stakeholders into the control plane, and potentially allowing attackers entry through complicit or rogue operators. Similar vulnerabilities now exist in the Diameter protocol within the 4G/LTE domain, as it provides parallel services to SS7."}]}

This message queries the current serving Mobility Management Entity (MME) and the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) of the targeted subscriber. After obtaining this information from the Send Routing Info for SM Answer (SRA), the attacker uses the Update Location Request (ULR) over the S6a interface to update the HSS, provisioning the spoofed MME as servicing the target customerâ€™s IMSI. When the subscriber sends a text to the SMS-C, the SMS-C queries the HSS for the serving MME and receives the spoofed MME address, allowing the attacker to intercept the message. This example highlights the risks posed by such intercept attacks that can capture sensitive confirmation messages from banks and social networks."}]}
