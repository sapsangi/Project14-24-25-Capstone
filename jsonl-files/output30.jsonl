By maximizing the geographic diversity of submarine cable routes and landings, operators can enhance network resilience and reduce the risk of damage from events such as tsunamis, vessel anchors, fishing gear, or terrorist attacks. However, operators must consider various factors when deciding on cable routes and landings, many of which are beyond their control. This is particularly challenging in the dynamic and increasingly crowded U.S. coastal and marine environment. The CSRIC IV Report on Spatial Separation discusses these issues in detail."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant providing information on telecommunications infrastructure, focusing on submarine cable systems."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What influences the routing and landing of submarine cables?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The routing and landing of submarine cables are influenced by factors beyond control, such as dynamic U.S. coastal and marine environments. These environments are crowded and lack a single marine spatial planning regulator. This leads to activities and infrastructure being authorized without consideration of future submarine cable development. Such circumstances increase potential clustering of cables, which heightens risks associated with non-diverse infrastructure.\n\nRouting diversity is critical in cable system construction and is considered an industry 'Best Practice.' The key idea is to have routing between two points over more than one geographic or physical path without common points. Increasing diversity at cable landing points, including elements like Beach Manhole (BMH), Outside Plant (OSP), and Cable Landing Station (CLS), reduces vulnerabilities. The FCC examines ways to enhance geographic diversity to promote network resilience."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant specialized in telecommunications and infrastructure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you discuss the importance of redundancy and resiliency in submarine cable systems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Redundancy and resiliency are crucial for maintaining the reliability and functionality of submarine cable systems. Redundancy involves using physically diverse routes to ensure that if one path fails, others can take over to prevent service disruption. While the submarine cable industry doesn't have a standardized set of redundancy criteria, efforts focus on ensuring each part of the system, especially cable landing stations (CLS), has appropriate redundancy built in.\n\nResiliency, meanwhile, refers to the ability of system components—such as individual submarine cables, shore infrastructure, and CLS—to resist threats and withstand damage or failure. Resilient systems can quickly recover and return to operational status after disruptions. Network resiliency utilizes redundant routes to reroute traffic if part of the network is compromised.\n\nAdditionally, managing the physical elements like Beach Manholes (BMH) is important. BMHs are buried chambers where submarine cables are terminated and connected to further infrastructure. They are usually designed to take multiple cables; however, clustering cables in a single manhole or too close to each other might increase failure risk. Spread out manholes, with limited cables per manhole, can mitigate risks from localized events like hurricanes or accidental damage."}]}]}

However, they face various vulnerabilities. For instance, if a station fails due to natural disasters, power outages, or even terrorist acts, it can lead to catastrophic conditions, impacting connectivity. Risk mitigation strategies include using dedicated CLSs for each system or isolating space, power, and cooling within a shared station. It's also essential to consider physical security, protection against natural disasters, and the construction quality of the building housing the CLS. Additionally, having diverse routing for the cables and employing distinct termination equipment can reduce the risk of a single point of failure. Outside the CLS, diverse routing of outside plant (OSP), including conduits and fiber cables between the beach manhole (BMH) and the CLS, can further help reduce vulnerabilities to both human-induced hazards and natural events."}]}

Economically, the site is chosen based on access to a carrier, content provider, or cloud services provider's point-of-presence (POP) or data center, along with the demand for capacity. Economic negotiations with commercial fishermen, government, tribal, and private landowners can also play a role. Technically, the cable must be routed to avoid natural hazards and protected with burial and armor to prevent damage from anchoring or fishing gear. The cost of construction is influenced by the length of the cable, especially on the continental shelf where it needs to be armored and buried, and the proximity to existing terrestrial infrastructure. Landing sites with established shore end infrastructure and network access are often preferred to reduce costs. As a result, cables often congregate at or near the same locations."}]}

Economical considerations often lead to choosing sites with existing shore end infrastructure and network access, which results in cables being congregated at or near the same landing. If the demand is high enough to justify the investment, new landing sites might be developed, requiring new seabed leases, beach and OSP land leases, and construction of CLS. The project's duration, regulatory and permitting times, and operational costs, including leases and maintenance, also play significant roles. Route redundancy requirements for network resilience often demand diverse routes. In the U.S., common landing sites are in the Northeast, Florida, Northwest, and California. Regulations might restrict cable presence in certain areas, contributing to the clustering of landing sites away from these areas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant with expertise in undersea telecommunications infrastructure and regulatory compliance."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the impact of regulatory factors on the placement of undersea cables?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Regulatory factors significantly influence the placement of undersea cables. Certain laws or regulations may prohibit the landing of cables in specific areas, leading to clustering in locations away from restricted zones. For instance, Florida restricts cable landing in the Keys and specific Gulf coast counties, encouraging clustering in other areas of the state where cables must navigate through 'reef gaps.' Additionally, the presence of National Marine Sanctuaries may prohibit or significantly restrict undersea cables, prompting cable owners to choose alternative routes.\n\nIn areas without such regulatory restrictions, the choice of landing locations often depends on the ease and cost of obtaining permits. For example, in Oregon, the permitting process is relatively straightforward after joining a Cable/Fishing Liaison Committee, whereas in California, the process is more expensive and time-consuming, with higher ongoing costs such as submerged lands easement fees. These differences make some states more attractive for cable landing due to lower costs and simpler procedures."}]}

At the state level, an easier permitting process and lower costs make some states more attractive. States without a developed permitting regime might be avoided due to uncertainty. At the federal level, variations in regulation application between Army Corps' Districts play a role. The type of permit—individual, general, or a regional one—can vary by district, leading some to preference sites within districts with more predictable or favorable permitting conditions. These decisions may also be impacted by considerations outlined in the CSRIC V and IV Reports regarding interagency coordination and spatial separation of infrastructure."}]}

These measures may influence the decision of where to land the infrastructure. On the West Coast of the United States, especially regarding marine mammals and wildlife, similar mitigation efforts are necessary regardless of the state chosen for cable installations. In Florida and the Caribbean, protection of corals, seagrass, and mangroves requires unavoidable mitigation. Certain regions, like off San Luis Obispo, California, use the 'sand channel' for clustering cables to avoid hard bottoms, which helps in burying the cables efficiently. Furthermore, the topology of the seafloor is crucial when designing cable routes, as known oceanographic data and findings during surveys can impact clustering. Deep-water cables, beyond 1,500 meters, are more cost-effective and experience fewer breaks compared to those laid on the continental shelf."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant providing detailed information on submarine cables and their installation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the challenges and considerations in laying submarine cables?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Submarine cables laid in deep waters (approximately >1,500m) are generally cheaper to manufacture and install compared to those on the continental shelf. They also experience fewer breaks over their lifespan. Cable routes aim to minimize lengths in shallow topologies or avoid them altogether. For example, most Trans-Atlantic cables take a southern detour from the shortest path to bypass the Flemish Cap and Grand Banks off Newfoundland, leading to cable clustering at minimal separation distances. \n\nEach trans-oceanic cable must cross the continental shelf margin, featuring steep slopes, submerged canyons, rocky ridges, and high seismic activity levels. Such environments pose risks of cable breakage from abrasion, debris flows, and rockfalls. Master routing avoids unstable areas, resulting in clustered cables at optimal transition spots from shallow to deep ocean. \n\nUpon determining a cable’s path, marine surveys map seabed conditions and potential obstacles like seamounts and rocky outcrops. These features could complicate cable laying or cause suspensions, leading to abrasion and failure over time. Near shore, generally under 1,500 meters depth, cables often need burying for protection and to minimize impact on the fishing industry."}]}
