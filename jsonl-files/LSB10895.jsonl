The FCC will no longer issue authorizations for equipment produced by Huawei Technologies Company and ZTE Corporation, which are two of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers in the People's Republic of China. Additionally, equipment from surveillance camera manufacturers Hytera Communications, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, and Dahua Technology will not be authorized unless these companies provide plans to ensure their equipment is not used for public safety, government facilities, critical infrastructure, or other national security purposes. The FCC did not revoke prior authorizations for these companies but sought comments on whether it should consider doing so in the future."}]}

For instance, under Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2019, Congress restricted Executive Branch agencies from procuring or contracting with companies that use equipment or services from Huawei, ZTE, and other noted foreign entities. Additionally, the Department of Commerce has a review process for transactions affecting the ICTS supply chain that might pose national security risks. Furthermore, the FCC has prohibited several telecommunications carriers from the People's Republic of China from providing services between the U.S. and other countries, requiring carriers to obtain FCC authorization with scrutiny from an interagency committee focused on national security."}]}

They may recommend to the FCC that an application be denied or existing authorizations be revoked. Recently, the FCC has revoked or denied Section 214 authorizations for several PRC telecommunications companies, like China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, and Pacific Networks, due to the executive branch's assessment that the PRC government controls these firms, posing national security risks."}]}

Through the Universal Service Fund (USF) restrictions and reimbursement program, the FCC restricts carriers receiving USF subsidies from using equipment or services on a Covered List. This list includes products from PRC-based companies like Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision, and Dahua, as well as from Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab. These measures, initially established by the FCC, were reinforced by the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019, passed by Congress in March 2020."}]}

This Act directs the FCC to maintain the Covered List and establishes a program to reimburse carriers for the costs of replacing 'covered equipment' in their networks. The FCC uses its equipment authorization authority to restrict electronic devices that raise national security concerns. According to the Communications Act, the FCC can adopt regulations governing the 'interference potential' of devices capable of emitting radio frequency (RF) energy."}]}

Under the SDoC process, the responsible manufacturer or importer only needs to make a self-determination that the equipment complies with the FCC’s technical standards and must make testing information available to the FCC upon request. Some devices are exempt from the certification and SDoC processes because their potential for causing harmful interference is so low, such as devices with very low power consumption or that generate very low frequencies."}]}

These rules implement the Secure Equipment Act of 2021, which took effect in November 2022 and directs the FCC to adopt rules clarifying that the Commission will no longer review or approve authorizations for equipment on the Covered List. The EA Rules require all applicants using the certification process to attest that the application is not for Covered Equipment. They also prohibit companies named on the Covered List from using the SDoC process or from relying on an exemption for their equipment, even if that equipment is not Covered Equipment. This requirement secures the FCC’s oversight over these companies and prevents evasion of the prohibition on Covered Equipment."}]}

It is considering comments on whether and how to revoke or withhold authorizations for component parts manufactured by entities on the Covered List. The FCC's R&O specifies that Covered Equipment includes 'telecommunications equipment' and 'video surveillance equipment' from companies like Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision, and Dahua. For Huawei and ZTE, all telecommunications and video surveillance equipment is covered. For Hytera, Hikvision, and Dahua, the equipment is only covered if used for prohibited purposes like government facility security or critical infrastructure surveillance. The FCC requires these companies to submit an approval plan to ensure their equipment isn't marketed for prohibited purposes. Affected parties have 30 days from the R&O's publication in the Federal Register to challenge these EA Rules."}]}

They have 30 days from the R&O's publication in the Federal Register to take their case to a federal appellate court. However, the publication of these rules might be delayed due to the Office of Management and Budget's review under the Paperwork Reduction Act, so it is uncertain when or if litigation will commence."}]}

For example, Hikvision has argued that the FCC does not have the authority to ban video surveillance equipment because it is 'peripheral' customer premises equipment. They assert that the ban is unprecedented enough to fall under the major questions doctrine, thus requiring explicit Congressional authorization."}]}

A widely used argument in these scenarios is that the restrictions act as an unconstitutional 'bill of attainder,' meaning that they impose legislative punishment without a trial. To succeed with this argument, challengers must show that the law (1) specifically targets individuals or groups and (2) inflicts punishment without trial. Proving that the restrictions inflict punishment can be challenging, as seen in Huawei's case against the 2019 NDAA."}]}

Similarly, the D.C. Circuit reached a comparable conclusion in the 2018 case of Kaspersky Lab, Inc. v. DHS, which addressed the 2017 NDAA's prohibition on government agencies using products from Kaspersky Lab.

Congress can influence the FCC’s efforts by addressing issues such as equipment authorizations. For example, Congress could decide whether the FCC should revoke prior authorizations for Covered Equipment, balancing concerns about consumer options, supply chain impacts, and the necessity for network or national security. Revocation might also engage constitutional considerations, such as due process rights."}]}

While it's uncertain whether companies have a constitutionally protected property interest in FCC equipment authorizations, legislation allowing the FCC to revoke these authorizations without due process might face challenges. Affected companies may claim that revocation without compensation violates the Takings Clause, which prohibits the government from taking property for public use without just compensation. Although equipment authorizations are unlikely to be considered property under the Takings Clause, companies might argue revocation constitutes a 'regulatory taking' if it causes serious financial loss and frustrates investment-backed expectations. Congress could address this by setting a sunset timeframe for authorizations, akin to broadcast licenses, potentially limiting future revocations."}]}

While the FCC has the authority to regulate finished products, extending this authority to component parts could be burdensome, especially for small companies. The Internet & Television Association (NCTA) suggests that the FCC's equipment authorization authority is limited to finished products. Congress might need to address this by potentially passing legislation to clarify the scope of the FCC's authority in regulating component parts."}]}
