It enables users, applications, and devices to reference services and computers using names instead of IP addresses. Typically, users or IT staff would configure a name server IP address for devices and applications, or devices would automatically use server IPs provided by the ISP. A caching resolving name server, or 'resolver,' would then handle client requests by making recursive DNS requests to authoritative servers. The results would be returned to the client and cached to improve efficiency, enabling quicker responses to repetitive queries."}]}

Originally, DNS used a lightweight UDP protocol for most requests, falling back to TCP if a UDP response wasn't received. This was efficient as DNS queries and responses often fit within a 512-byte UDP packet. Enhancements like EDNS0 later allowed larger responses through packet fragmentation. In the early DNS days, popular software like Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) was used. During the 1990s, as consumer Internet use increased, operating systems like Windows 95 included DNS resolvers. Microsoft also released its own name server software for Windows NT 4.0 in 1996. During this time, resolvers were often openly accessible on the Internet, a practice that has changed due to modern network threats."}]}

In response to this, the concept of utilizing firewalls and restricting name service access evolved, especially within commercial or enterprise networks. Attempts at altering resolver information, known as 'cache poisoning', prompted improvements in DNS software like BIND. Specialized software was also developed to distinctly handle resolver and authoritative server functionalities. Moreover, denial of service attacks in the 1990s revealed vulnerabilities in protocols like UDP and ICMP, allowing attackers to forge source addresses and conduct attacks without direct attribution. Despite proposed solutions by the IETF, rapid Internet infrastructure growth hindered widespread adoption, and reflected attacks became notable as benign servers could be exploited to direct traffic toward a victim."}]}

DNS amplification attacks are a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack where an attacker exploits the Domain Name System (DNS) to overwhelm a target with a large amount of traffic. The attacker sends DNS queries to a DNS server, using the victim's IP address as the return address. The server, in turn, sends much larger responses back to the victim. This not only generates large volumes of traffic directed at the victim but also hides the attacker's true location. The amplification factor makes this attack particularly potent, as a small query can generate a significantly larger response, thus overwhelming the targeted network."}]}

Initially, load balancers were used to help servers manage increased traffic, though this could inadvertently direct more spoofed traffic to victims. Protective layers like firewalls were then placed around servers for added defense. Source IP validation, such as unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), was also introduced to drop packets based on the router's ability to reach the source IP. Additionally, BIND 9, released in 2000, included Response Rate Limiting (RRL) to limit amplification from recursive servers. BIND 9.4, released in 2007, further enhanced security by disabling recursion on DNS servers by default. Despite these efforts, DNS amplification attacks remain a threat, with attacks growing in size and complexity, such as the 2013 attack on Spamhaus. The Internet community continues to work on new solutions, like the US Anti-Bot Code of Conduct, to protect against botnets and mitigate DDoS risks."}]}

Network operators should determine appropriate BGP session-level counter-measures and denial-of-service counter-measures for router infrastructure. Stub networks should filter traffic to ensure only assigned IP ranges are used as source addresses in outgoing packets. Transit networks should implement features like unicast Reverse Path Filtering (uRPF) where applicable. These precautions help mitigate control-plane attacks against BGP sessions and route processors. Additionally, it is recommended that service providers and network operators monitor developments by the IETF's SIDR Working Group and follow the GROW Working Group discussions for related operational issues."}]}

This trusted mapping helps protect against attacks like prefix and subprefix hijacks, where unauthorized ASes originate routes for IP prefixes, intercepting the traffic intended for those prefixes. Network operators can use the RPKI in two main ways: by registering BGP routes they originate, and by using RPKI information to detect and filter unauthorized routes from other ASes. RPKI operates out-of-band of the BGP protocol, with objects stored in public repositories, allowing routers to make informed routing decisions in BGP. The most crucial objects in RPKI are route origin authorizations (ROAs), which specify which AS is authorized to originate certain prefixes, protecting against hijacks. The RPKI structure mirrors the IP address allocation hierarchy, with RPKI authorities managing their own publication points for ROA distribution."}]}

These RIRs sub-allocate addresses to national/local Internet registries or ISPs, who can further allocate them. Each RPKI authority has a resource certificate containing its cryptographic public key and allocated IP addresses. Using their certificate, authorities issue signed objects for their IP addresses: (1) a resource certificate for sub-allocating addresses, or (2) a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) to authorize AS to originate IP prefixes. Manifests log the hash of each object in a repository, ensuring integrity. A hypothetical RPKI hierarchy might have ARIN delegating 8.0.0.0/8 to Level3, which could delegate smaller blocks like 8.8.8.0/24 to companies such as Google."}]}

A relying party downloads the RPKI repository data to its local cache to validate and categorize each BGP route based on Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs).

'Unknown' routes have no covering ROA, while 'Invalid' routes have a covering ROA but no match. For example, a BGP route for 8.0.0.0/8 by AS 3356 is valid with a matching ROA, whereas a similar route by AS 666 is invalid with no match. Any route for 12.0.0.0/8 is unknown due to the absence of a covering ROA. These validations impact BGP routing decisions by defining the trustworthiness of routes."}]}

Before registering ROAs, operators must understand how their IP prefixes and subprefixes are used in BGP. ROAs usually contain one Autonomous System (AS) and multiple IP prefixes. It's crucial to issue ROAs for all prefixes and subprefixes; otherwise, any unregistered subprefix routes will be deemed invalid. For example, if an operator issues a valid ROA for 8.0.0.0/8, all BGP routes for subprefixes under 8.0.0.0/8 will need their own ROAs to be considered valid. Intermediate Resource Certificates (RCs) owned by RIRs issue leaf RCs to organizations like Sprint and Swisscom, which then issue ROAs."}]}

An alternative policy, as described in RFC6483, is to deprefer invalid routes rather than filter them outright. This means a router will choose a valid route over an invalid one for the same prefix but still allow connectivity via invalid routes if no valid option exists. This approach helps maintain route accessibility even when RPKI classifications are incorrect but doesn't prevent subprefix hijacks automatically, as explained in RFC 7115.
