Repeated Validation: Measurements should be repeated over time to ensure consistency and detect changes or trends in resolver performance.\n4. Treatment of TCP Queries: DNS resolvers may handle TCP queries differently, so it is crucial to measure how these are processed to understand the system's reliability and performance better.\n5. Permissiveness in ISPs: Some ISPs may be permissive with DNS requests, which might affect the accuracy of DNS measurement and security.\n6.

In the given report, several statistics related to queries and responses to Shinkuro's name server are presented. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Total Probes Resulting in Queries: Approximately 27.2 million probes resulted in queries arriving at Shinkuro's name server, which responded to all these queries.\n\n2. Correctly Answered Queries: Over 17 million queries were returned with the correct answer from the probe address.\n\n3. Unanswered Queries: More than 10 million queries were not returned from the probe address despite reaching Shinkuro's name server. This is flagged as a significant number that should be investigated further, as the single-attempt methodology may have impacted results.\n\n4. Locally Generated Responses: Over 8 million queries resulted in locally generated responses that did not correlate with any query to the name server. Most of these (99.9%) were errors labeled as SERVFAIL.\n\nFurther steps are suggested in the report, including retrying unanswered addresses, using the DNSSEC Resolver Check program, and analyzing patterns between probe and query addresses. Additionally, identifying software versions and ISPs using IP address correlation was proposed to refine data accuracy."}]}

They observed that many DNS resolvers are DNSSEC Aware, though a large number exhibit limitations in areas such as support for large packets and DNAME records. The study also found that a small but noteworthy number of resolvers actively perform validation. While there is substantial support for DNSSEC operations, the findings highlight the existence of incomplete implementations and emphasize the need for maturation in operational deployments. Lack of DNAME record support by many validators does not cause major issues currently due to minimal use, but this could change as usage grows."}]}

This recommendation aims to create competitive pressure for other companies to follow suit, with prioritization based on the prevalence of threats in each industry. Additionally, they suggest that software developers, like web-browser developers, study how to incorporate DNSSEC validation into their software, possibly through visual indicators. Furthermore, Working Group 5 recommends that the FCC encourage ISP participation in testing schemes and continue the deployment of DNSSEC across the Internet ecosystem."}]}
