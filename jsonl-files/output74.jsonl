One key issue is that legacy wireline or wireless origination networks may hesitate to upgrade without a compelling reason, as upgrading before PSAPs (Public Safety Answering Points) do is mostly a cost without a corresponding benefit. This was seen when the FCC mandated wireless and VoIP network providers to upgrade to E9-1-1. For the next upgrade to NG9-1-1, the FCC needs to consider legacy wireline originating network providers, especially those with legacy 9-1-1 systems. Conversely, some PSAPs may want to upgrade but cannot afford it, and the transition might take a long period. This poses a risk of decreasing customer base and revenue for operators of the existing E9-1-1 system, against their fixed costs. Even if PSAPs are early adopters, both old and new systems might need to run in parallel for some time, requiring someone to bear the cost. An OSP (Originating Service Provider) involved in the transition, with a significant presence in the area but serving many PSAPs that are not upgrading, must also operate both systems for an unknown duration.

If one PSAP decides to stop using the legacy selective router (SR), the costs of selective routing are then shared by fewer PSAPs, increasing the cost for each remaining one. During the transition to the NENA i3 architecture for NG9-1-1, a Legacy Selective Router Gateway (LSRG) bridges an existing E9-1-1 system to an NG9-1-1 system, allowing calls to transit depending on the upgrade status of the network. While an origination network or PSAP upgrades to NG9-1-1, they can use 'Legacy Network Gateways' (LNG) and 'Legacy PSAP Gateways' (LPG) to maintain their current interface while participating in an ESInet.

Only eight states have enacted legislation to collect these fees at the point of sale (POS), which is crucial for proper collection. Texas, for example, collaborated with wireless carriers and retailers in 2009 to amend their statute and ensure revenue collection from the sale of prepaid cellular services. It's essential for all states to revise their legislation to address this issue, aiming for a neutral approach where all services providing 9-1-1 access collect and remit fees at the same rate.

As NG9-1-1 continues to develop, national policy will need to address system security, interoperability between networks, including international call routing, and state networks. This will necessitate increased federal involvement in both policy and planning, demanding a greater federal role and funding. A funding mechanism needs to be established for these newly acquired responsibilities.\n\nAccording to CTIA, there are over 292 million wireless devices in use today with access to 9-1-1 services in the U.S. If a national NG9-1-1 fee of just $0.01 were collected from each device, it would generate more than $3 million monthly or $36 million annually. While these revenues alone may not be sufficient, when combined with a fee on all devices or access points capable of accessing 9-1-1, they could start funding the transition to NG9-1-1. Revenues could be earmarked for NG9-1-1 transition projects and the new functions and responsibilities under federal direction. A 'National NG9-1-1 Transition Fee' could support the transition between legacy 9-1-1 systems and NG9-1-1 and may taper off or sunset when such funding is no longer necessary.\n\nThe transition is expected to occur over time, and without strong federal guidance, might be extended longer than reasonable.

Moreover, they are working with PSAPs and local governments to develop funding sources and ensuring interoperability for various messaging and communication technologies for all users, including those with disabilities."}]}{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant knowledgeable about regional 9-1-1 emergency systems and the planning necessary for Next Generation 9-1-1 implementations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What initiatives have the Counties of Southern Illinois taken towards implementing NG9-1-1 systems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Counties of Southern Illinois have formed a consortium of 18 counties called CSI with the purpose of planning and implementing a NENA standards-based NG9-1-1 system. This regional system and service will replace their current E9-1-1 infrastructure. The initiative includes legal and regulatory changes to allow the consortium to become the 9-1-1 service system provider. The acquisition, installation, and testing of this NG9-1-1 system require new and revised procedures. CSI is actively identifying and implementing these procedures by utilizing emerging national standards from public safety and industry organizations. This involves a transitional approach to fully upgrade their emergency response capabilities."}]}

Washington State has outlined a multi-phase plan for upgrading its 9-1-1 system to NG9-1-1. Phase 1, which is funded, involves a pilot project managed by QWEST and Intrado for establishing an NG9-1-1 network in select counties. Phase 2, also funded, aims to expand the NG9-1-1 network across the remaining counties and the Washington State Patrol's PSAPs. Phase 3, currently on hold pending funding, focuses on implementing call answering equipment in line with national 9-1-1 standards. This is crucial to modernize the network from a legacy analog system to a more advanced IP system, providing robust data and voice communication capabilities."}]}
