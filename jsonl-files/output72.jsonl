This prevents further data compromise while gathering information about the attacker. During a response, it is common to continue gathering intelligence over days or weeks to fully understand the attack. Costs related directly to labor are a significant part of the incident response budget.\nTo block malicious traffic, existing security devices should be utilized. In cases of denial of service attacks, organizations attempt to filter and block malicious traffic to limit damage. Network filtering, firewall, and perimeter access lists are essential to prevent both ingress and egress traffic to the system. During DOS or DDOS attacks, directing traffic away from the affected system is crucial. Once the threat is mitigated, a thorough analysis is performed using system images and volatile data, preserving evidence for further insights.\nCalculating the cost of a cyber incident is complex, factoring in both direct labor and the indirect costs resulting from the blockage of legitimate traffic.
