The SS7 network, which was initially based on trust among a small group of carriers, has expanded significantly due to rapid growth in mobile communications. Originally, it managed connections among hundreds of carriers and served the majority of the 7.46 billion mobile subscribers worldwide as of June 2016. The expansion led to several key implications:\n\n1. Increased Access: With more people using mobile services and global roaming, the number of carriers accessing the SS7 network has grown.\n\n2. Deregulation and Access: The global telecommunications sector has been deregulated, exemplified by the U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996. This deregulation lowered the barriers to access SS7, opening up the network to more competition and usages, like SMS services for diverse applications.\n\n3. Open Networks: The opening and expansion of networks have led to complications as the original closed, trust-based network system now supports a vast array of participants and services.\n\nOverall, as more networks and participants join, managing trust and security within the SS7 network becomes more challenging."}]}

Although Diameter is not currently used for interconnection, meaning there's no direct evidence of exploitation, attackers may still try to exploit potential access vulnerabilities. The Diameter Edge Agent (DEA) plays a key role in protecting networks by filtering Diameter commands, examining Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs), and checking the origin and destination of commands. It must also verify that the application-ID of a message is allowed on the received interface per 3GPP standards. Besides Diameter, other potential risk areas include ANSI MAP, SCCP-based DoS attacks, and MAPv1 or GTP data attacks.

Additionally, it's important to monitor the behavior of tenants, such as those in wholesale business or MVNOs, ensuring they comply with the rules. Trust assessment relies on guidelines such as 3GPP TS 33.116 and TS 33.117, monitoring requirements like GSMA FS.11, FS.07, and FS.19, and legal regulations. Trusted hardware, NFV management rules, and employee training are also factors.
