One primary challenge is the distribution of classified information from government to private entities, which may affect the quality of information shared between private entities. Access to such information by cleared individuals can influence operational activities, while absence of access might impact business operations. It's important for classified information to be downgraded and distributed responsibly. Additionally, information sharing rules must consider the trustworthiness of the recipient, the sensitivity of the information, and the potential impact of sharing. Organizational impediments are particularly pronounced in international contexts. CERTs and CSIRTs across countries may differ in procedures, technology, and resources, affecting collaborative capabilities. Differences in government classification mechanisms further complicate sharing among international teams. International sharing tends to be more robust among culturally and linguistically similar countries, yet it lacks the historical depth seen in domestic U.S. sharing."}]}

One major challenge is the complexity and time-consuming nature of validating what is applicable and prioritizing its implementation. Operational changes can slow down the information sharing process, and require well-defined procedures aligned with performance goals. Moreover, balancing the timeliness and reliability of intelligence is crucial; rushing may lead to unreliable data, while taking too much time can hinder proactive protection efforts. Technical barriers include issues with capacity, accuracy, quality, timeliness, and the lack of consistent, standard formats and terminology. Without standardization, data sharing becomes ad-hoc, leading to integration challenges and potential data quality issues.
