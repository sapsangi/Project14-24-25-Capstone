Short alert and warning messages (90- and 140-characters) are unique in their structure but limited in effectiveness. Due to their brevity, they often fail to clearly communicate the source of the message and the necessary guidance and hazard information. Hence, they rely heavily on additional context provided by others to motivate public protective actions.2. Several pathways exist to improve current wireless emergency alert messages: This includes reordering message content, selecting specific message sources, and initiating public education and marketing efforts about the WEA system.3. The findings offer valuable insights into designing future optimized wireless emergency alerts and warnings that are comprehensive and don't depend on external information."}]}

Research suggests that an alternative order of message contents could improve public response. While the current order is hazard, location, time, guidance, and source, a proposed alternative—source, guidance, hazard, location, and time—could enhance response, especially in shorter 90-character messages. Furthermore, using local and recognizable sources in these messages might improve public interpretation and personalization, leading to more effective protective action."}]}

These elements positively affect public alert and warning responses by telling people exactly what to do (guidance) and why they should do it (hazard). However, 90- and 140-character messages are less effective than 1,380-character messages in helping people overcome preconceived perceptions about hazards and guide them to take protective actions. The longer messages, delivered over mobile devices, have a consistent impact across different types of hazards, unlike the shorter messages. Therefore, it suggests that longer messages could manage public alert and warning responses more effectively."}]}

In contrast, shorter messages of 90 or 140 characters tend to be less effective. This may be because more detail allows the public to understand and act upon the protective measures necessary during an emergency. However, opinions differ, with many emergency managers favoring shorter, 140-character messages. This presents a dilemma: whether to base alert message lengths on scientific evidence or prevailing beliefs and opinions."}]}

This method can result in differences in coverage, as some users might not receive the alert if only the centroid-based method is used.\n\nEach method has its implications for alert distribution and coverage efficiency, potentially impacting the proportion of targeted users who receive the alert."}]}

In contrast, the Desired Area is the target zone intended to receive the alert. The distinction between these areas can lead to discrepancies in alert distribution. For instance, using eNB-based methods, WEAs can cover about 42% less cell-sectors than desired. Similarly, with centroid-based methods, around 35% fewer cell-sectors receive the alerts than intended. This can result in certain sectors, such as cell-sector B of eNB-11, not receiving WEAs at all."}]}

This approach aims to enhance reliability and redundancy, especially during emergencies when terrestrial networks might be compromised. Devices such as cell phones, computers, and automobiles with communication access, display screens, and location-based technology could receive these alerts. Similar to the Emergency Alert System (EAS) where messages are broadcast over various channels, mobile devices would automatically ignore duplicates, focusing only on one source. Alerts, along with geo-coordinates for precise targeting, would be distributed via cellular (LTE or future 5G), WiFi, and potentially satellite if equipped, and other future technologies. Additionally, trusted servers would push these alerts through cellular data and WiFi channels, while cellular systems would use the Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system, and satellite transmissions would rely on satellite providers receiving alert data."}]}

In the case of satellite transmission, a satellite provider receives the alert information from FEMA IPAWS, possibly acting as a gateway with the satellite provider. The provider maps the alert area to the satellite coverage that best matches it. For future broadcast technologies, alerts are sent from FEMA IPAWS to the broadcast provider, who then broadcasts it to an area that matches the alert area. Upon receipt, the mobile device renders the alert and ignores duplicates that arrive via other channels. Devices should be able to use current and future technologies and leverage their evolving intelligence. Additional information in subsequent alerts can provide users with more details."}]}

Modifications to the C interface would be necessary for this enhancement. Additionally, if a different message ID is utilized, modifications to both CMSP WEA infrastructure and 3GPP standards would be required. The report also touched on the need for mobile apps to establish WiFi connections with trusted servers to retrieve additional information securely. For non-broadcast channels, secure delivery of information to third-party WEA apps on a push basis was suggested, along with having direct connections to FEMA IPAWS to support alternative mobile device connections without disrupting cellular networks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant knowledgeable about emergency alert systems and their delivery mechanisms."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the pros and cons of using alternative connections for Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs)?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pros: Supporting longer WEA alert messages on mobile devices with active alternative connections uses WiFi without disrupting the cellular network. It creates redundant distribution, reaching nearly all devices within the alert area. It removes repetitive alerting for the same message. Broadcast channels like LTE cell broadcast, eMBMS, and satellite reach devices within their broadcast area. Satellites cover the entire country and territorial waters, delivering alerts even when terrestrial systems are compromised by disasters. Using a device’s location filters alerts to the defined polygon by the alert originator, regardless of delivery channel. Multiple delivery channels enhance reliability and resilience by leveraging the payload and service capabilities of each. WiFi and broadcast technologies complement the wireless network, and the mobile device ensures alert uniformity with multiple delivery channels.\nCons: Unlike CMSP infrastructure capabilities that target support for all users and devices, older devices might not support new system capabilities. This suggests a complex and potentially costly mobile device not required for basic telecommunications services. Devices described (e.g., satellite-capable) are not envisioned due to complexity and cost, particularly when CMSP infrastructure can support longer messages. Obligations on satellite providers in addition to CMSPs complicate rules, as satellite obligations fall under EAS rather than WEA. This option demands international standardization."}]}

Satellite provider obligations are under EAS and not WEA, which requires international standardization and best practices to align both wireless and satellite technologies. Additionally, there are technical challenges such as the need for satellite providers to perform beam spotting and the correlation of WEA text message to the original alert is often lacking. Implementing changes, like different message IDs, would require significant infrastructure and mobile device modifications, potentially resulting in complex and costly developments that could take several years to roll out to the public. Mobile devices may also not reliably connect to WiFi, which complicates relying on such connections for emergency alerts."}]}

These include potential network congestion, as trusted servers may become overloaded during an alert. Mobile devices may be connected to WiFi within a car, but this does not guarantee an external connection, and WiFi connections may not be free or available to all subscribers. Additionally, there are no existing mobile device APIs for third-party apps to receive alerts, and some smartphone operating systems do not support storing alerts in a WEA inbox, preventing retrieval by apps. Security is another concern, as opening systems to all mobile devices worldwide could invite malware or man-in-the-middle attacks.
