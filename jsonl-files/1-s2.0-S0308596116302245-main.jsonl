The journal serves as a bridge between academia and stakeholders, with content often originating from academic and policy-research organizations. This connection has a twofold development: firstly, decision makers benefit from the journal's insights, though the impact is tricky to measure; secondly, policy agendas can shape research focus, influencing journal content. The ongoing dialogue links hot policy and regulatory issues to academic publications, fulfilling a purpose as the discipline matures by compiling and organizing facts crucial for understanding its evolution."}]}

In the ICT field, the significance of journals may be assessed by examining the transfer of knowledge from academic articles to practical applications, such as marketable products. One approach is to use citations in patents as a proxy for measuring technological value, as suggested by Liaw et al. in 2014. However, measuring impact for policy journals is more challenging, as their contributions may not be directly linked to technological advancements."}]}

Two primary theories have dominated discussions about the use of academic research in policy making. The 'two-communities theory' by Caplan (1979) suggests that underutilization of research is due to the distinct languages, rules, and motivations of policy makers and academics, which leads to poor connections between them. In contrast, the 'enlightenment function of social research' by Weiss (1977) posits that decision makers use research indirectly as a source of ideas and information, which can have profound effects over time even if the process isn't easily visible. While these theories laid foundational concepts, newer contributions have nuanced these views, suggesting the relationship is not simply about use or non-use, but rather occurs on a spectrum of interaction."}]}

Conversely, telecommunications policy has also impacted the field of Telecommunications Policy as an academic discipline. This reverse link between policy activity and academic research reveals much about the historical evolution of the field. For instance, the antitrust lawsuit filed by the United States Department of Justice against AT&T in 1974 is considered a milestone marking the modern era of telecommunications policy. Publications such as Telecommunications Policy have chronicled and analyzed key events in the field, providing insights and recommendations. Understanding the historical context of Telecommunications Policy helps illuminate the ongoing interactions between academic research and policy development."}]}]}

It has two main objectives: forming a taxonomy of papers, which is an empirical based classification, and discovering relationships between terms that aren't possible at the individual word level. The key to cluster analysis is measuring term similarity, where cosine distance is often preferred over Euclidean for text data. However, in this case, Euclidean distance was used since both are equivalent for text vectors of normalized length. The k-means clustering algorithm was chosen due to the size of the dataset, allowing for iterative reassignment of terms to minimize distance within clusters and maximize it between clusters. The article also explores a full range of potential clusters to determine the optimal number."}]}

Televisions, new services, and conferences marked an example of media and telecommunications convergence.\n\n2. Mid Liberalisation Stage (up to about 1995): This stage retained relevance on previous topics and added new topics about the impact of liberalisation on services like telephony, emphasizing differences across global regions.\n\n3. Late Liberalisation Stage (up to about 2000): Focus shifted to regional differences in approaches to liberalisation, its impacts on traditional services like telephony, and the role of digital television. There was a renewed interest in the implications of Internet use and deployment.\n\nFollowing liberalisation, there are information society stages:\n\n1. Early Information Society Stage (up to about 2005): Focus on spectrum auctions, mobile communications' new generations, conventional broadband, and industry standardization, largely from a supply-side viewpoint.\n\n2. Mid Information Society Stage (up to about 2010): Dominated by the regulation-investment-competition triangle, with emphasis on mobile and broadband.\n\n3.
