Firstly, EAS Participants might need to update settings or software to provide an option to disable text-to-speech. A significant concern is the usability of CAP EAS messages if there’s an issue with the audio file from the CAP Originator. Without text-to-speech, there is no fallback for creating a voice component if the audio is absent or corrupted. Video programmers could still display the text per Part 11 requirements, but this raises issues for individuals with visual disabilities if the aural component is missing. This could also affect low power television stations, which aren't required to send audio alerts and may not provide any audio cue. For audio programmers like broadcast radio, the absence of an audio file means no aural alert beyond the EAS header and attention tones, which significantly impacts the broadcast's efficacy."}]}

This severely impacts the effectiveness of the alert for listeners. The current EAS rules, as per §11.51(b), discourage using attention tones in the absence of audio. Additionally, the EAS-CAP Industry Group (ECIG) guidelines warn that without an audio file or text-to-speech conversion, devices would only output EAS header tones and End of Message tones. Systems that rely on text-to-speech may need significant updates due to text-to-speech prohibitions. There's no mandate or funding for jurisdictions to modify systems to generate MP3 files for EAS CAP devices.

This necessitates an average speed of 50 Mbit/sec for timely delivery within 60 seconds. In contrast, a CAP message without audio only requires 4k to 6k bytes of data, significantly reducing the data volume to about 2 MB for the same network size. Additionally, while CAP messages with a digital signature authenticate the XML content, they don't guarantee the intended content of referenced audio files. This and the need for securing remote files may slow down the system. Furthermore, current CAP profiles do not mandate digital signature usage. The certification of EAS devices has also been categorized into three classes: integrated CAP EAS encoders/decoders, universal intermediary devices, and component intermediary devices, with certain FCC findings not yet reflected in the intended Part 11 revisions."}]}
