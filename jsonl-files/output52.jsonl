There are several technologies used for emergency alerts, each with unique capabilities:\n\n1. **Off-Air Radio Broadcast (Analog):** This technology is used for broadcasting but has limitations in geo-targeting for customized alerts in limited areas. All alerts are sent to every tuned receiver in the broadcast area, determined by transmitter power and terrain. However, FM Radio Subcarrier alerting can address receivers with targeted alerts. Broadcasting is robust due to its capability for multimedia distribution without congestion.\n\n2. **Off-Air Television (Broadcast):** Similar to radio, television broadcasting works as a broadcast medium with the same limitations and robustness as radio.\n\n3. **Off-Air Digital Television (Mobile DTV):** Already deployed in over 130 U.S. stations, this can support geo-targeting. With a Mobile EAS application, alerts with CAP geocodes can be sent to MDTV-enabled devices, which can then determine user relevance based on geo-location. The alerts can be displayed with enhanced media and map overlays.\n\n4. **Tele-Communications (Plain Old Telephone Service, POTS):** This tethered medium can effectively utilize geo-targeting, such as Reverse 911™, allowing for tailored alerts.

Innovations may demand new data elements in CAP messages, requiring a formal standards process to integrate these changes. Such processes can be lengthy and resource-intensive, delaying the rapid deployment of new technologies. \n\nAdditionally, the emergence of profiles under CAP can aid in targeting alerts to specific dissemination channels, like EAS, CMAS, and NOAA Weather Radio. Profiles help customize the standard for practical needs, like the IPAWS profile that serves EAS and CMAS requirements. However, without streamlined processes, emergency managers might waste time populating template fields irrelevant to certain channels, such as sirens. While the USA and Canada have formal profiles, other regions, like Australia, are developing their own through OASIS.
