This ensures that all federal, state, and local stakeholders have confidence that emergency alert system (EAS) messages will be disseminated during actual emergencies. Regarding guidelines, the federal warning mission focuses primarily on the EAN code for Presidential declarations in major national emergencies. To ensure that warnings are effective, emergency management should coordinate them with all other response aspects. The EAS, along with the Primary Entry Point infrastructure, must always be ready to support the National Emergency Alert (EAN) if needed, even as social warning resources expand. Successful warnings depend on integrating emergency public warnings as a core response resource at all management levels, with FEMA and local agencies responsible for proper warning origination."}]}

To encourage better participation, the FCC could consider adopting incentives such as recognizing participation as a positive element during the license renewal process. Additionally, creating incentive programs that encourage participation could strengthen the EAS in local markets and improve state EAS infrastructures. It's also important for the FCC to reduce unnecessary disincentives and allow for candid reporting of deficiencies discovered during testing.

An effective test plan will help ensure the efficient distribution of state, local, and weather-related EAS messages.

Sometimes, parts of a county are listed separately, as in the case of East and West Jefferson, divided by a National Park with no road access between segments. Decisions regarding these divisions are best made by the State Emergency Communications Committees (SECCs). For Emergency Alert Systems, EAN Primary Sources include FEMA-designated facilities that directly receive Emergency Alert Network (EAN) messages from a FEMA Operation Center to be delivered to EAS participants. EAN Secondary Sources receive messages from Primary PEP sources and distribute them further, monitoring the Primary Sources.
