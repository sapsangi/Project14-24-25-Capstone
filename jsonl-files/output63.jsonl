One major issue is ensuring end-to-end priority, which includes having the proper staffing at Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) to handle prioritized 911 calls efficiently. While LTE networks could potentially support prioritization by marking communications as priority, similar to the Phase II Wireless E9-1-1 upgrades, the network's bottlenecks need consideration. These bottlenecks can occur anywhere from the cell tower backhaul to the mobile switching network and onto the selective router. Most backhauls have been updated to handle high-speed data, reducing potential bottlenecks there. However, if backhaul capacity is insufficient, upgrades are necessary to support prioritized calls. Further, any chokepoints between the originating carriers and the selective router must be addressed. With average PSAP staffing at 2 to 4 call takers, even if these chokepoints are resolved, congestion might still occur, causing issues like fast busy signals or alternate routing. NG911 broadband solutions aim to overcome these limitations by eliminating legacy selective routers and increasing both capacity and data types that can be transmitted to PSAPs, impacting their operations."}]}

These features increase the likelihood of call completion, especially in congested networks. Terminating Radio Channel Priority ensures incoming WPS calls receive priority access to local channels without requiring the recipient to be subscribed to WPS."}]}

This is due to call volume restrictions caused by trunk line availability and the number of personnel available to answer calls. NG911 could offer more opportunities for prioritization by reducing network bottlenecks, but implementing prioritization throughout the access networks and call path would be very complex. While prioritization might be introduced on 4G networks, it would require both network and handset upgrades. Legacy handsets would not benefit from such prioritization. Furthermore, network call capacity is constrained by the call-taker capacity, making end-to-end prioritization less effective on 4G networks. GETS and WPS prioritization methods were also considered for 9-1-1 calls. However, adapting these methods, which are designed for national security and emergency preparedness calls, presents substantial challenges, particularly in differentiating between 9-1-1 and NS/EP calls without limiting the number of users. The limited call capacity remains a significant issue even if prioritization challenges were addressed."}]}

One method is the implementation of non-emergency numbers like 3-1-1, which provides access to non-emergency government services and can reduce unnecessary 9-1-1 calls. However, 3-1-1 might be more cost-effective in large urban areas compared to rural or suburban locations. Public education is another strategy, informing the public on the correct use of 9-1-1 and guiding them to other resources during major emergencies to alleviate network congestion. Virtual consolidation, which integrates the technological benefits of a physical consolidation without the need for a centralized location, is also beneficial for handling overload situations."}]}

Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) and Wireless Priority Service (WPS) are services that provide prioritized telecommunication channels for certain government users during emergencies. These users receive one of five priority levels in a government-determined hierarchy. While 9-1-1 calls could potentially be prioritized, the prevailing opinion among government and industry experts is that 9-1-1 calls should not surpass any priority levels of GETS/WPS. The rationale is that first responders using GETS/WPS are crucial to managing emergencies, potentially yielding a higher life-saving impact than 9-1-1 calls from the general public. Additionally, during large-scale emergencies, multiple 9-1-1 calls are frequently duplicates, reporting the same incident."}]}

GETS/WPS users typically have higher priority levels than 911 callers. However, both are given priority over regular public network calls. Yet, to balance this system, only a certain percentage of radio resources can be consumed by either 911 or GETS/WPS users, ensuring that non-emergency communications can still occur. This prevents government users from monopolizing radio resources, thus maintaining access for the general public to communicate with friends and family during crises."}]}

This prioritization could interfere with existing priority services such as GETS/WPS, since network mechanisms might not differentiate between levels of priority. The principle that 'if everybody has priority, nobody has priority' highlights the potential for network congestion. Consequently, without precise prioritization schemes, the network may not support additional prioritization for 911 calls without impacting current priority services. In conclusion, it is recommended not to implement additional prioritization within 2G/3G networks at this time, despite the evaluated strategies to ensure 911 availability during high-traffic conditions."}]}

This recommendation is based on the conclusion that prioritization does very little to ensure that 9-1-1 calls reach emergency personnel during disasters due to the lack of PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point) personnel resources in such situations. PSAPs are identified as the ultimate choke point during emergencies. Existing wireless networks do not provide end-to-end prioritization for 9-1-1 calls to PSAPs, and implementing such capability would require major redesigns of 2G and 3G networks. While LTE networks offer some level of prioritization, significant development is needed for complete end-to-end prioritization. Moreover, using existing priority services like GETS/WPS for consumer 9-1-1 calls might degrade these services' effectiveness. WG10 suggests that FCC, Public Safety, and carriers focus on educating the public to minimize non-emergency calls during disasters, thereby helping individuals in true emergency situations reach 9-1-1."}]}
