For example, a 99% availability means the network can be down for about 3.65 days a year, while 99.999% (five nines) represents only about 5.26 minutes of downtime annually. The choice of these requirements will shape the network's design and cost, as all elements must meet these standards to maintain overall reliability.\n\nWhile aiming for five nines of reliability using the Internet as the primary transport can significantly impact network reliability, the Internet itself cannot be seen as a highly reliable or mission-critical network. It employs a 'best efforts' delivery model, which does not guarantee end-to-end service, affecting its suitability for 'lifeline' applications. Critical infrastructure organizations often cite this as a reason the Internet cannot be depended upon for high-stakes scenarios.\n\nAdditionally, Internet reliability risks are continually evolving, with changes in threat likelihood and consequences expected over the next decade."}]}

It is recommended to identify and universally utilize best practices and standards throughout the network to ensure security.\n\nMonitoring endpoints such as broadcast television, broadcast radio, cable television, IPTV, and direct broadcast satellite services require FCC-mandated CAP devices to either be intelligent in connection or incorporate secure transport like VPNs. Specifically, for broadcast TV and radio, the monitoring endpoint is typically the broadcast facility itself, while in cable and IPTV systems, alerts might be delivered directly to the set-top box at the customer's location.\n\nEnsuring network security involves utilizing hardware that supports both internal and external security measures, such as firewalls.

The audio stream should ideally start from the beginning to ensure the complete message is conveyed. The current IPAWS architectural design supports a CAP-based EAN alert streamed audio message, though it has not been fully tested with defined specifications beyond existing ECIG guidelines.

However, duplicates may still occur when the audio content is the same, but other data elements differ, leading the EAS device to interpret them as different alerts.

For example, during a large storm system, the National Weather Service (NWS) might issue an alert over multiple NOAA transmitters, each covering its own set of location codes. If two transmitters send messages covering the same area, such as county C, they may not be recognized as duplicate EAS messages if their location lists differ. This can lead to stations in county C broadcasting both messages, even if they are identical.\n\nTraditionally, geographic barriers and limited monitoring by receiving stations helped prevent message duplication. However, with the distribution of EAS messages via FEMA's IPAWS CAP feed, this geographic shield is removed. This means every station can receive both the original CAP alert and the version sent by their local NOAA transmitter. Unintentional duplicates can occur if a NOAA transmitter sends a subset of the full CAP message location list to EAS, allowing multiple versions to be broadcast by stations and cable head-ends.\n\nThis issue poses a challenge as it can result in redundant airing of identical alerts, potentially causing confusion and alert fatigue among the public."}]}

The goal isn't to have globally unique identifiers like the CAP standard, but rather a shorter string to distinguish alerts issued within the same hour. A 10 or 11 bit number might suffice, encoded into two extra bytes. Proposals for this include: adding extra bytes to the ZCZC string, using short headers after the attention tone, sending alert IDs as location codes, or embedding FSK data in the audio payload.

This method requires changes to the National Weather Service (NWS) audio message generation but not to the EAS generator. It doesn’t require modification of the current Part 11 coding structure and can quickly be adopted by EAS vendors as an addendum to current decoding practices. Furthermore, using this method allows for extensible future data encoding. An alert ID parameter must be added to the CAP message to avoid message duplication.
