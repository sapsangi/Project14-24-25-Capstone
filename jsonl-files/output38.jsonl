Submerged structures can preclude cable ships from accessing the sea floor easily. Heavy vessel traffic, fishing activities, military operations, and seasonal restrictions are also factors that can delay or impede operations. Cable installation requires continuous 24-hour operations, where the cable is floated ashore and laid flat on the sea floor. In near-shore areas, cables are often buried for protection, unless the seabed allows surface laying without significant risk. For repairs, cable ships generally use grapnels to retrieve cables from the sea floor, although remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) can be used under certain conditions. Accurate placement of equipment is critical, but adverse weather, heavy seas, or strong currents can affect operation precision."}]}

Once both ends are on board, they are repaired, tested, and connected via a spliced section. This section is typically two-and-a-half times the water depth to allow manipulation and repair at the surface. The repaired cable is then returned to the seabed, laid perpendicularly to ensure it lies flat and does not form loops, restoring connectivity."}]}

However, adverse weather and sea conditions can affect accuracy and pose risks to other cables or installations. Once the cable is located, it usually requires cutting to reach the surface. This involves at least three passes with the grapnel: the first to cut the cable, the second to bring up and buoy one end, and the third to retrieve the second end. After bringing both ends aboard, they are repaired, tested, and a new section is spliced in to restore connectivity."}]}

Spatial separation involves distancing submarine cables from each other and other marine activities to minimize risks. Mesh-network topologies are a decentralized network design where each node connects to at least two other nodes, allowing for reconfiguration and self-healing capabilities should a component fail. This is supported by dispersing key functions across multiple providers and systems to reduce outage recovery times. While mesh networking is often used in mobile wireless networks, it is also critical in submarine and terrestrial fiber-optic networks.

Florida considered proposals to create preferential areas for cable landings and routing, suggesting lenient permits if cables were placed in specified 'cable corridors,' but these proposals are currently dormant. Massachusetts has developed the Massachusetts Ocean Plan, which aims to balance current ocean uses with future needs by establishing Renewable Energy Areas based on exclusionary screening criteria like compatibility and impact mitigation. The plan also designates a Multi-Use Area open to various uses, managed by siting and performance standards, complemented by the Massachusetts Ocean Resource Information System (MORIS) for data management. Maryland is coordinating ongoing ocean management efforts with the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO). However, issues remain in terms of comprehensive approaches to protect submarine cables alongside these initiatives."}]}

California has developed the Coastal Impact Assistance Program to address conflicting marine uses, including submarine cables, and is working towards a comprehensive marine spatial plan. Hawaii's Ocean Resources Management Plan addresses conflicts between commercial and natural resources but does not have a detailed spatial plan or cable corridors. Oregon, with its Land Conservation and Development Commission, has established Proprietary Use and Management Areas as part of its marine spatial planning."}]}

In these PUMA areas, applications for marine energy projects will not be accepted unless the proposed use is legally permissible and complies with the authorized cable use. In Washington, a law requires an interagency team to develop a marine spatial plan to manage conflicting seabed uses on the Pacific Coast. This team, including the Department of Ecology, Fish and Wildlife, and Commerce, is consulting with environmental groups and stakeholders to create enforceable requirements. Washington also evaluates the potential environmental impacts under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and considers compatibility with existing uses before issuing Shoreline Conditional Use permits."}]}
