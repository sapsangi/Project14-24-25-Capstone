The General Services Administration (GSA) awarded EIS contracts to 10 vendors in 2017, introducing a new acquisition vehicle with a combined value of up to $50 billion over a possible 15-year period, including one 5-year base period and two 5-year option periods. EIS aims to provide cost savings through increased supplier competition, deliver a comprehensive portfolio of cybersecurity solutions, incorporate emerging technologies, and offer flexibility to meet unique agency requirements. The transition involves more than 135 agencies shifting 32 types of services and millions of voice and data lines to EIS before the current contracts' expiration on May 31, 2023."}]}

They must identify key personnel for the transition, engage expertise from agency leadership to build a transition team consisting of telecommunications managers, acquisition experts, and financial staff. They also need to conduct an inventory of services to be transitioned, develop a transition plan and schedule that includes GSAâ€™s major transition milestones, prepare solicitations for task orders, place task and service orders, and develop a process to review, accept or reject, and pay for services. The General Services Administration (GSA) supports this process through a Transition Coordination Center that assists with inventory validation, transition planning, and solicitation development, as well as Transition Ordering Assistance for requirements development, source selection, and proposal evaluation."}]}

For instance, during the transition beginning in 1998, an estimated $74 million in missed savings occurred. Similarly, the 2007 transition to Networx was delayed by 33 months, resulting in an additional $66.4 million in costs and an estimated $329 million in lost savings. These savings were lost because agencies continued using services from the old contract at higher rates, even when cheaper options were available under the new contract. These delays were largely attributed to inadequate project planning."}]}

The highest Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) transition percentages, at or over 70%, were reported at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, National Science Foundation, and Department of the Treasury. In contrast, the lowest percentages, at or under 30%, were at the Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, Office of Personnel Management, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Overall, 6 out of 24 agencies reported over 50% EIS adoption. Achieving higher percentages positions an agency better for a full transition by the September 30, 2022 milestone date."}]}
