A secure system is one that behaves only as explicitly defined by its specification. Attacks often exploit unintended behaviors. For example, Wi-Fi devices communicate by broadcasting messages over radio channels intending to mimic a direct link between devices. However, any receiver on the same channel can intercept these messages, resulting in eavesdropping, which takes advantage of this unintended behavior. Effective system design involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, solvable sub-problems, mitigating such vulnerabilities."}]}

The main goal of any cybersecurity project is to select appropriate adversary models to identify the security problems that need resolving.

Anyone with a radio receiver within about 100 meters can capture messages sent over a Wi-Fi channel. Likewise, a person with a transmitter can send messages or jam a Wi-Fi channel. Non-security professionals often mistakenly prioritize confidentiality threats, which are mitigated by encryption.

One notable vulnerability is the 'bit-flipping' attack, which allows attackers to create valid forged Wi-Fi messages without having the WEP encryption key. To ensure message integrity and benefit from encrypted Wi-Fi messages, an integrity mechanism is essential. Additionally, encryption does not hide all data over a Wi-Fi channel; traffic analysis can identify specific applications and devices based on message timing and sizes. Inserting dummy messages can counter traffic analysis but may degrade Wi-Fi performance. Denial-of-service attacks are also a concern, but combating them is often left to non-technical methods, such as moving Wi-Fi devices away from jamming sources. Overall, Wi-Fi security addresses some vulnerabilities but cannot entirely prevent traffic analysis and denial-of-service attacks."}]}

Off-the-shelf, easy-to-use, and low-cost tools exist to launch attacks against Wi-Fi confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Given the ease of launching successful attacks against unsecured Wi-Fi networks, it is prudent to use security mechanisms as much as possible. However, since Wi-Fi radio has a short range, normally around 100 meters, attackers must be near the targeted network. This locality constraint makes it difficult for Wi-Fi attacks to be part of a global criminal enterprise, so such attacks are likely to be opportunistic and only one tool within a larger set of attack methods."}]}

However, they do not address broader security concerns such as protection from malicious behavior originating from outside the Wi-Fi network, like internet-based attacks, device compromises, corrupt administrators, and supply chain attacks. The security technologies focus on mitigating unintended Wi-Fi vulnerabilities but do not cover comprehensive security needs. Special consideration should be given to attackers possessing both network and software adversary skills, as this combination can exploit even well-secured Wi-Fi setups. Wi-Fi security relies on proper session establishment and association of mobile clients, making it crucial that these processes are secured from potential attacks."}]}

These grammars imply ambiguity, meaning it is formally undecidable if different hardware or driver implementations from various vendors provide equivalent semantics. Subtle semantic differences can be exploited, creating potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, such grammars allow for novel, valid messages that were never contemplated by the designers, hence receivers may not handle them appropriately. This leads to an inherent risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities, making the notion of creating an unconditionally secure system unrealistic. Consequently, it is more practical to aim for a system where the risk of compromise fits a predictable probability distribution, allowing the ecosystem to assess and manage the risk."}]}

It's often not feasible to create systems that unconditionally defend against all adversaries, meaning adversarial penetration is common. A major challenge is the lack of adequate monitoring, auditing, and analysis to detect attacks, due to factors like cost, increased code size, and the need for rare expertise. Teams often overestimate their understanding of their own systems compared to hackers, a knowledge advantage that diminishes as hackers, who are patient, skilled, and knowledgeable, continue to improve their methodologies over time."}]}

Ad-hocs and Soft APs: Ad-hoc Wi-Fi networks could be used as honeypots to collect user credentials. To mitigate this, clients must verify they are connecting to the intended network through Wi-Fi network (access point) authentication. If not authenticated or trusted, clients should use a VPN to connect through a known trusted endpoint.\n\n2. AP Security including Firmware and Software: Firmware updates can be tampered with, potentially installing malicious software. To mitigate this, the manufacturer should authenticate software updates using digital signatures to verify the integrity and source before installation. Ensure the software's quality control process is verified and the code-signing keys and services are protected.\n\n3. Data Interception: This threat involves the interception of data sent over Wi-Fi by eavesdroppers. Mitigation involves using securely encrypted session protocols between mutually authenticated endpoints to prevent sniffing clear transmissions and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n4. Denial of Service: This involves blocking access to the network using RF DoS, jamming, or disassociation packets. While hard to mitigate, controlling client access and using protocols to prevent malicious de-authentication can help."}]}

In large public venues, they can be mistaken for legitimate parts of the network infrastructure, fooling the public and potentially capturing sensitive data. Modern WLAN controllers can identify rogue APs but cannot determine the intent behind them. Investigating these requires Convention Center IT staff to locate the rogue devices, a process hampered by venue size and crowd density. Rogue APs can be as inconspicuous as smartphones or portable MiFi devices, making them hard to detect. This increases the risk of delays in mitigation efforts, as IT staff must navigate not only through large spaces but also approach individuals to inspect potential devices, which poses social and ethical challenges."}]}
