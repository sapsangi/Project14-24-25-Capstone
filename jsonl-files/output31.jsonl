Manual rebroadcast by an on-duty operator is also an option.\n- Local Primary sources should not wait the full 60 minutes to give downstream stations time to relay the RMT.\n- Each RMT must be logged according to the EAS Participant's facility policy.\n- If an RMT isn't received or relayed, the cause and any corrective actions must be documented.\n\nFor the RWT:\n- As per FCC rule 11.61(a)(2)(i), EAS Participants must send an RWT at least once a week on random days and times unless exceptions apply.\n- No weekly test is needed during a month with a monthly test (rule 11.61(a)(2)(iii)).\n- A national test supersedes weekly and monthly tests during its occurrence (rule 11.61(a)(3)(ii)).\n- State or Local Area EAS activations may replace weekly tests under certain conditions outlined in rule 11.61(a)(4).\n- DBS Providers, and certain FM and TV stations are exempt from the weekly test requirement as per rule 11.61(a)(2)(ii).\n- Rule 11.51(m) mandates using the RWT event code and appropriate location codes when transmitting the weekly test.\n- Lastly, EAS Participants are not required to transmit a video as stated in rule 11.61(a)(2)(iv)."}]}

Firstly, the EAS Task Force suggests dropping references to the Emergency Action Notification (EAN) and Emergency Action Termination (EAT) since the FCC has removed the EAT event code. Additionally, it's recommended to modify the section assuming an operator is always on duty at EAS Participant facilities, as many of these are often unattended. Regarding message authentication, the mention of 'staff responsible' is outdated because manual authentication is no longer standard. Also, there is a proposal to harmonize terminology with the EAS Test Reporting System (ETRS) since other documents use 'Electronic Test Reporting System'. Lastly, corrections include specifying the transmission of 8 seconds of Attention Signal and updating the location code format for 'All U.S.' from '00' to '000000' as agreed in the EAS Sixth R&O."}]}
