Prefix filters come in by ensuring that only the designated IP prefixes from a customer's network are advertised, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized route announcements. The effectiveness of these filters depends on accurate and up-to-date IP allocation and assignment records.

These queries produce a list of ASNs and address blocks to whitelist in router configurations. Automated systems can query IRRs at intervals to update route filters, but must validate the data's integrity using RPSL (Route Policy Specification Language) authentication, as outlined in RFC 2725.

One concern is that RPKI could increase both the risk and impact of these blocking methods. Filtering at the ISP receiving traffic or along the route may leave targets accessible through proxies. Moreover, if a single provider stops routing for IP address blocks, a customer with multiple providers or independent IP space could circumvent it. Additionally, the hierarchical nature of RPKI means that a single party can globally impact the validity of information lower in the hierarchy. This party, possibly in a different legal jurisdiction, can unilaterally impact any target IP prefix's validity with minimal detectability, thus influencing the reliability of internet access."}]}

Revoking or misconfiguring a network IP address certificate or Route Origin Authorization (ROA) in the RPKI does not necessarily compromise reachability for this address. The effects' severity depends on how ISPs use the RPKI data in their routing decisions. ISPs implement local policy to decide how they use this information, which can include allowing or disallowing prefix origination, assigning lower preferences to routes classified as invalid, or filtering these routes entirely."}]}

However, given the nascent stage of RPKI deployment, it's hard to predict the policies Autonomous Systems (ASes) will use, making it challenging to quantify misinformation impact. To mitigate these risks, it's vital to monitor and audit RPKI database modifications. Transparency issues arise because RPKI doesn't standardize including resource holder identity in certificates, which may lead to legal concerns or misuse as identity certificates. Therefore, ensuring synchronization between allocation data and RPKI data is crucial for maintaining system integrity and reliability."}]}

They should also consider the establishment of public sites to publish real-time changes to the RPKI, similar to BGP update collections like RouteViews. These sites help in data gathering, comparison, and reporting, and are valuable for forensic analysis when linked with other data sources, such as whois data. Given the complexity of discerning intent behind RPKI changes, such transparency is crucial. Organizations managing the RPKI hierarchy should promote open dissemination of RPKI-related data, improving BGP security and global routing system analysis. The RIRs should facilitate free and open access to RPKI data for research and community analysis without requiring formal approval."}]}

Clearly defining metrics for characterizing security incidents is crucial, as these metrics can help detect suspicious routes and their possible causes. While the RPKI provides a ground truth that enables more accurate measurements, the community still needs to work on evaluating and potentially extending existing security metrics. This includes examining their effectiveness in identifying both accidental and malicious incidents, as well as quantifying their scope and impact. Historically, metrics and methodologies have not been consistently utilized, and there is no consensus on the most effective approaches."}]}

There is a need to understand the limits of our ability to infer the intent behind an Autonomous System that originates incorrect information, distinguishing accidental misconfigurations from intentional attacks. Additionally, continuous monitoring and analysis of BGP security incidents are recommended, with a focus on the incremental deployment of security solutions.

Its primary function is to prevent routing loops by ensuring that a route does not revisit an AS. However, AS_PATH is also utilized for various additional purposes. BGP routers use it as part of their decision-making process for route selection. When a BGP-speaking router receives a route announcement, it analyzes the AS_PATH to determine the best path to network prefixes, applying routing policies defined by the operators."}]}

Without vigilant filtering by BGP players, these routes can propagate unchecked, exploiting legitimate route propagation rules. This can lead to BGP security incidents where malicious or inadvertent router configuration changes allow malformed routing messages to spread across multiple autonomous systems. Adequate route filtering is essential, but without a complete and updated repository of network ground truths, such filtering is challenging. Internet Routing Registries provide limited help because they are often incomplete or outdated."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant specialized in computer networks and BGP security."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain some of the vulnerabilities and issues associated with BGP security?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, is essential for internet routing, yet it has vulnerabilities due to its default configurations and lack of automated controls. Issues often arise when routers advertise routes learned from one ISP to another, leading to routing distortions. These distortions can disconnect victim networks or allow unauthorized traffic interception through man-in-the-middle attacks. Despite these challenges, BGP remains robust, with recovery enabled by identifying the sources of misconfigurations and restoring correct configurations. Transparency in ownership of IP blocks and AS numbers aids in verification and trust restoration. However, proposed solutions must maintain BGP's operational integrity while addressing worst-case security scenarios."}]}

One common type is route origin hijacking, which involves unauthorized announcements of routes to IP spaces not assigned to the announcer. This can occur due to malicious activity, inadvertent misconfigurations, commonly known as \"fat fingers,\" or errors in traffic engineering. These incidents often originate from a single BGP router or a group of related BGP routers within an Autonomous System by changing the router’s configuration, which can lead to peculiar route announcements affecting routing paths. Additionally, there are no universally accepted criteria for labeling a routing incident as an \"attack,\" and there is a noted lack of routing security metrics to automatically identify certain changes as security violations. This area is recommended for further research."}]}

One such category involves the hijacking of unused IP space—this is where routes to prefixes within large IP blocks, such as those assigned to the US government that usually aren't routed on the public Internet, are hijacked. These unused addresses can be used for criminal activities like spam or network attacks, making detection and diagnosis difficult. Another type of hijacking includes surgically targeted hijacks on specific routes or deaggregation attacks on specific IP addresses, which can be challenging to detect. A well-known example of this is the 2008 incident where Pakistan's advertisement of a more specific route led to YouTube being inaccessible globally. There are also cases of unambiguous massive hijacks affecting many routes. In these incidents, legitimate origin Autonomous Systems (ASes) are replaced by unauthorized ASes advertising hijacked routes. Notable incidents include the 'China's 18-minute Mystery' in 2010 and the TTNet incident in 2004. The motivations of the router administrators involved in such incidents can often remain unclear, complicating the identification of whether they were intentional misconfigurations or malicious activities."}]}

Such attacks exploit BGP routers’ route selection algorithms that depend on AS_PATH properties. One common issue is the unintentional announcement of invalid routes due to operator error, which can have large impacts. 'Man in the middle' AS_PATH attacks have been demonstrated, where traffic is detoured via a chosen AS.
