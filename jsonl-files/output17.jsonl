The sector collaborates with the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) to maintain National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) communication services, including the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS), Wireless Priority Service (WPS), and Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) Program. These services ensure priority call completion and circuit restoration during emergencies, supporting robust incident response and recovery efforts."}]}

Executive Order 13618 established the NS/EP Executive Committee to address these communication matters and make recommendations to the President to enhance the survivability, resilience, and future architecture of NS/EP communications. The National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) provides industry-based advice to the President on implementing NS/EP communications policy. At the operational level, the Communications Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Comm-ISAC) facilitates voluntary collaboration and information sharing among government and industry, supporting EO 13618 and national critical infrastructure protection goals outlined in Presidential Decision Directive 63. This partnership includes over 60 private sector ICT companies and 24 federal agencies, with industry members ranging from communications equipment and software vendors to wireless communication providers. The Comm-ISAC continuously monitors incidents impacting emergency communications, with the NCC Watch leading response and recovery efforts during emergencies under the National Response Framework."}]}]}

The Communications Sector Specific Plan (SSP) outlines the priorities and objectives, which are refined through a prioritization process involving the Communication Government Coordinating Council (CGCC) and the Communication Sector Coordinating Council (CSCC). The ultimate goal is to enhance national security and resilience. The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Communications (DHS CS&C) takes on the role of measuring sector-wide progress towards national goals using relevant metrics. This includes the preparation of an Annual Report by the CSCC to detail sector activities, ensuring communication networks are secure and resilient. This report aligns with the Communications Sector's risk management activities and contributes to the National Annual Reporting process."}]}

As part of their efforts, the sector is responsible for incentivizing member companies to protect their infrastructure while also providing the government with assurances on the effectiveness of these measures. This is achieved through the Sector Annual Reporting process, where the Communications Sector, under the guidance of the Communications Sector Coordinating Council (CSCC), develops an annual report that includes aggregated quantitative metrics and qualitative examples of risk management activities. This report is submitted to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and shared with the Communications Government Coordinating Council (CGCC), which includes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other agencies, ensuring they have insight into the sector's cybersecurity initiatives and progress. By doing so, the sector ensures transparency while receiving protections under the Critical Infrastructure Protection Advisory Council (CIPAC) and Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) regulations."}]}
