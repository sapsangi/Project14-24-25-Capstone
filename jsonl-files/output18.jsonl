The GCC works alongside the CISA to identify and prioritize initiatives impacting the Communications Sector. A key resource in this effort is the GCC Cyber Resource Hub, which helps agencies make data-driven risk decisions and aids the broader cybersecurity community by providing insights into vulnerability trends and effective mitigation strategies. Additionally, Cyber Planning Support offers expert-run workshops to assist stakeholders in developing integrated cyber plans. Information related to these efforts can be found on platforms like comms-scc.org and cisa.gov. Moreover, the Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management course educates participants about managing cyber risks within supply chains."}]}
