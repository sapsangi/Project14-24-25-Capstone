This led to the establishment of the Nationwide Emergency Telecommunications Service (NETS) to provide priority communications for national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) users. With the involvement of multiple service providers and significant government investment, the architecture of NETS was developed with unique equipment and procedures. In 1991, a White House recommended Panel of Experts reviewed the program and suggested a PSTN-based solution that would reduce costs while maintaining service robustness and technical relevance. The program was restructured following these recommendations, which led to the adoption of a revised service architecture."}]}
