By this letter, we confirm OCHIN, Inc.s withdrawal from the Program. If there are any questions regarding this withdrawal confirmation, please contact ConnectedCarefcc.gov. Thank you for your interest in the Connected Care Pilot Program.

I am writing this letter to formally withdraw my organizations pilot project from the Connected Care Pilot Program. I thank the Commission for its ongoing partnership with OCHIN and our consortia of participating health centers across the United States. The FCC has been instrumental in partnering with us to connect rural health care providers with subsidized medical-grade broadband service through the Healthcare Connect Fund Program, and providing community health centers across the country with telehealth technologies that connect underserved communities to health care in the wake of a global pandemic through the COVID-19 Telehealth Program. As you know, in January 2021, the Commission also selected OCHIN to administer up to 5.8 million on behalf of a consortium of members to directly subsidize internet services to patient homes in Ohio, Oregon, and Washington states through the Connected Care Pilot Program. Following a period of analysis and discussion with your attorney advisory team, we have made the hard decision to withdraw from the program. Despite both OCHIN and the FCCs desire and efforts to find a workable solution, unfortunately we are not able to move the project forward. This program was authorized during the worst of the pandemic, and community health care has since pivoted. Health care institutions have changed drastically to accommodate todays reality, with precious provider capacity directed to preserving patient access in a contracting economy. Accordingly, OCHINs anchor health care providers have encountered operational barriers and limited capacity to implement this pilot project according to the Connected Care Pilot Programs complex requirements. On OCHINs behalf I express our sincere gratitude for the Commissions selection of our pilot project. We continue to be committed to advancing the critical digital equity work of FCC programs through our long-standing consortia efforts. We look forward to sharing our learnings in supporting rural, tribal, frontier, and safety net providers and continuing our successful partnership with the FCC. If we can ever be of assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Respectfully, y Chief Financial Officer 2 DA 23-1 Released January 3, 2023 PUBLIC SAFETY AND HOMELAND SECURITY BUREAU OPENS THE EAS TEST REPORTING SYSTEM FOR FILINGS PS Docket No. 15-94 The Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau Bureau provides notice that the EAS Test Reporting System ETRS is now available to accept Form One filings.

On May 22, 2020, Pine Cellular filed its Initial Extension Request,10 which sought a waiver of section 1.2110f3vii to allow for additional time to meet the TLBC construction requirement.11 Pine Cellular explained that, when its license was issued in January 2018, it already had wireless mobile infrastructure in place and was well-positioned to deploy service to the Choctaw Nation communities within the three-year period.12 Soon after Pine Cellulars license was issued, however, the Commission initiated the Supply Chain proceeding and later adopted the rule to prospectively prohibit use of USF funds to purchase, obtain, maintain, improve, modify, or otherwise support any equipment or services produced or provided by covered companies.13 Pine Cellular receives high-cost support from the Commissions Mobility Fund Phase I and Connect America Fund Phase II programs, and Pine Cellular is an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier.14 Pine Cellular asserted that it needed additional time to deploy its network to serve the Choctaw Nation communities because its existing network in that geographic area uses Huawei equipment for the performance of core functions.15 5 See 47 CFR  54.9b In the Matter of Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain Through FCC Programs, WC Docket No. 18-89, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Order, 34 FCC Rcd 11423 2019 Supply Chain Order or Supply Chain Further Notice. 6 In the Matter of Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain Through FCC Programs  Huawei Designation, PS Docket No. 19-351, Order, 35 FCC Rcd 6604, 6631 para. 63 PSHSB 2020 Huawei Designation Order In the Matter of Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain Through FCC Programs  ZTE Designation, PS Docket No. 19-352, Order, 35 FCC Rcd 6633, 6646-47 para. 29 PSHSB 2020. 7 Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain Through FCC Programs, Second Report and Order, WC Docket 18-89, 35 FCC Rcd 14284 rel.

In this request, Pine Cellular stated that it planned to enhance its infrastructure by constructing approximately 20 new antenna sites, and adding a number of new remote radio heads, at a cost of approximately 1 million, to utilize the 600 MHz spectrum. Id. at 12. 13 See Supply Chain Notice 47 CFR  54.9 Supply Chain Order. In adopting the rule, the Commission initially designated Huawei as one of the covered companies for purposes of the rule. Id. see also 47 CFR  54.9b. In June 2020, the determination that Huawei is a covered company was made final, effective immediately. See Huawei Designation Order. 14 See Initial Extension Request at 2. 15 Id. at 2, 13. 9 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-3 5. Specifically, because Pine Cellular is prohibited from using USF funds to maintain, improve, modify, operate, manage, or otherwise support its Huawei equipment,16 it asserted that it could not act without a significant cost burden until the Commission acted in the Supply Chain proceeding to establish a cost reimbursement program for USF recipients to replace equipment from covered companies.17 Further, Pine Cellular argued, if it did expand its existing Huawei network it faced penalties if it could not prove to the Commissions satisfaction that it used non-USF funds.18 As a result, Pine Cellular claimed that it was unreasonable to build out its existing network in the area to serve the Choctaw Nation communities at that time.19 Pine Cellular asserted that imposition of the rule would have been inequitable and unduly burdensome, and given the complications with construction, Pine Cellular had no reasonable alternative.20 Pine Cellular sought a construction extension to a date not earlier than eighteen 18 months after the Commission adopts a Report and Order based upon the Supply Chain Further Notice.21 On October 1, 2020, the Bureau partially granted Pine Cellulars request, extending the construction deadline by one year to January 9, 2022.22 6. Second Extension Request. On July 27, 2021, Pine Cellular filed its Second Extension Request, which sought waiver of section 1.2110f3vii to allow Pine Cellular an additional year to meet its TLBC construction requirement.23 Pine Cellular explained that its TLBC construction progress had been affected by the continued development of the Reimbursement Program and uncertainty as to what extent it would be reimbursed for costs associated with its removal of Huawei equipment it installed before June 30, 2020, if it took action before it could participate in the Reimbursement Program.24 Pine Cellular also stated that, in order to meet the extended January 9, 2022 deadline, it would have to complete a significant number of steps and expressed doubt that such efforts could be completed in time 16 See 47 CFR  54.9a. 17 Initial Extension Request at 18-19 referencing Supply Chain Further Notice. Specifically, Pine Cellular explained that if it built out its existing Huawei network to the Choctaw Nation communities as originally planned, it would be using insecure equipment, and may ultimately need to rip out and replace the newly-installed network due to the Supply Chain restrictions. Id. at 21. 18 See 47 CFR  54.9 Initial Extension Request at 24. See also Supply Chain Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 11452, para. 72. Although the rule does not prohibit USF recipients from using their own funds to purchase or obtain equipment or services from covered companies, the Commission stated that it believes it unlikely that many USF recipients will be able to show the detailed records necessary to demonstrate that no USF funds were used and expressed skepticism that any USF recipient seeking to use USF funds on an eligible portion of such a project would will be able to establish with the necessary certainty. Id. 19 Initial Extension Request at 23-24. 20 Id. at 22-23. Pine Cellular argued that if it had constructed a parallel network without using Huawei equipment to meet its TLBC construction deadline, it would not be eligible for cost reimbursement for the additional expense, estimated at 8 million, through the Supply Chain proceeding. Id. at 17-19, 21. Pine Cellulars net winning bid for the license at issue was approximately 4.88 million and it was granted a Tribal lands bidding credit of approximately 2 million.

Since Pine Cellulars Second Extension Request was granted, the Reimbursement Program application window closed.27 Pine Cellulars applications for reimbursement have been approved by the Commission and it has received allocations from the Reimbursement Program.28 8. Third Extension Request. On October 25, 2022, Pine Cellular filed the instant Third Extension Request, which seeks waiver of Section 1.2110f3vii to allow additional time to meet the TLBC construction requirement.29 Pine Cellular argues that it needs additional time to construct because it faces unique and unusual circumstances and ongoing equipment supply chain issues, related in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, have undermined Pine Cellulars efforts to move forward with the deployment of facilities utilizing 600 MHz spectrum to serve the Choctaw Nation communities.30 Pine Cellular requests that the Bureau further extend its deadline to meet its TLBC construction obligation so that this deadline is the same as the one-year deadline for the Companys completion of the permanent removal, replacement, and disposal of covered communications equipment pursuant to the Reimbursement Program.31 9. On November 30, 2022, the Bureau issued a Public Notice seeking comment on Pine Cellulars Third Extension Request.32 No commenters filed in response to Pine Cellulars request, and we have received no opposition from the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. III. DISCUSSION 10. Pursuant to section 1.925 of the Commissions rules, a waiver may be granted if the petitioner establishes that 1 the underlying purpose of the rule would not be served or would be frustrated by application to the instant case, and that grant of the waiver would be in the public interest or 2 in view of unique or unusual factual circumstances of the instant case, application of the rule would be inequitable, unduly burdensome or contrary to the public interest, or the applicant has no reasonable 25 Id. at 10. Specifically, Pine Cellular stated that, in order to meet the extended January 9, 2022 deadline, it would have to 1 complete construction of a parallel mobile wireless broadband network in the areas served by its current network 2 switch its operations over to this parallel network 3 remove its old network facilities, including facilities serving Choctaw Nation communities, which had relied on Huawei equipment for core functions and 4 complete the extension of the newly-built parallel network to serve the Choctaw Nation communities, in compliance with the TLBC construction requirements.

July. 18, 2022. 29 See generally Third Extension Request. 30 Id. at 6-7. 31 Id. at 16. For example, if Pine Cellular were to submit its initial Reimbursement Program reimbursement claim on December 15, 2022, and the Commission issued an initial draw down disbursement to Pine Cellular on January 15, 2023, then Pine Cellulars TLBC construction deadline would be January 15, 2024, the same date as its Reimbursement Program deadline for the removal of covered communications equipment. In addition, Pine Cellular argues, if the Commission extends the one-year Reimbursement Program deadline by six months for all recipients, pursuant to section 1.50004h1 of its rules, this extension should also apply to Pine Cellulars TLBC construction deadline. Id. 32 Public Notice, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Market-Based Applications Accepted for Filing, Report Number 17305 Nov. 30, 2022. 11 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-3 alternative.33 Section 1.946 of the Commissions rules governs extensions of construction periods for stations in the wireless radio services.34 The rule provides that relief may be granted for good cause if such relief is requested before the expiration of the construction period.35 As described in more detail below, we find that the unique circumstances described by Pine Cellular warrant a third limited waiver and further extension of Pine Cellulars TLBC construction requirement deadline. 11. As an initial matter, we note that the Commission has recognized that members of federally-recognized American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Villages . . .and other residents of Tribal lands have lacked meaningful access to wired and wireless communications services.36 In recognition of this challenge, the Commission established the TLBC program to provide incentives for wireless service providers to deploy advanced wireless services to benefit the residents and communities on Tribal lands.37 The Commission recognized that various circumstances, including economic factors, could affect the ability of recipients to meet the TLBC requirements,38 and strongly encouraged parties to seek waivers of specific rules or file other requests for regulatory relief in those instances where greater flexibility than the rules allow would facilitate the provision of service to tribal lands.39 12. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that Pine Cellular has no reasonable alternative to meet its TLBC construction requirement, and that application of the deadline set by section 1.2110f3vii of the Commissions rules would be contrary to the public interest.40 As Pine Cellular noted in its prior extension requests, it already had wireless mobile infrastructure in place in this service area and did not anticipate that the Supply Chain rules would substantially alter its plans to build out its existing network when it received its 600 MHz license with a Tribal land bidding credit.41 Pine Cellular explains that its TLBC construction progress has since been further affected by equipment supply chain issues, related in part to the COVID-19 pandemic.42 Specifically, Pine Cellular explains that its efforts to meet the January 9, 2023 TLBC construction deadline have been negatively impacted by the global 33 47 CFR  1.925b3. 34 47 CFR  1.946e. 35 Id. Pine Cellulars TLBC construction deadline is January 9, 2023, and it filed its request prior to that deadline, on October 25, 2022. 36 Improving Communications Services for Tribal Nations by Promoting Greater Utilization of Spectrum over Tribal Lands, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 26 FCC Rcd 2623, 2624, para. 1 2011 see also Inquiry Concerning Deployment of Advanced Telecommunications Capability to All Americans In a Reasonable and Timely Fashion, 2018 Broadband Deployment Report, 33 FCC Rcd 1660, 1662, 1687-88, paras. 6, 57-58 2018 noting that Tribal lands continue to lag behind with respect to broadband deployment. 37 See Extending Wireless Telecommunications Services to Tribal Lands, WT Docket No. 99-266, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making, 15 FCC Rcd 11794 2000 Tribal Lands Order. More recently, the Commission has established other initiatives to facilitate the deployment of advanced wireless services on Tribal lands. See, e.g., In the Matter of Transforming the 2.5 GHz Band, WT Docket No. 18-120, Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd 5446, 5463, para. 47 2019 establishing a Tribal priority window for Tribal entities to obtain unassigned 2.5 GHz spectrum on Tribal lands that are located in rural areas. 38 Extending Wireless Telecommunications Services to Tribal Lands, WT Docket No. 99-266, Second Report and Order and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 18 FCC Rcd 4775, 4783, para. 22 2003. 39 Extending Wireless Telecommunications Services to Tribal Lands, WT Docket No. 99-266, Third Report and Order, 19 FCC Rcd 17652, 17656, para. 8 2004 citing Tribal Lands Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 11808, para. 39. 40 See 47 CFR  1.925b3ii. 41 Second Extension Request at 2 see also generally Initial Extension Request. 42 Third Extension Request at 7. 12 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-3 semiconductor shortage, and that it lacks any reasonable alternatives for meeting the deadline.43 Pine Cellular explains that it cannot add covered communications equipment to its existing network in order to enable deployment of 600 MHz broadband service in the Choctaw Nation communities, because the Commissions rules prohibit such use of covered communications equipment.44 Further, Pine Cellular states that, even if it could obtain all of the needed compliant equipment in a timely mannerwhich it asserts it cannotit could not add this compliant equipment to its network because it would not be compatible with Huawei equipment still in use in its existing network.45 Pine Cellular notes that its only alternative is to first remove and replace all Huawei equipment in its existing network, and then to construct a new network with compliant equipment.46 Pine Cellular asserts that, unfortunately, this alternative has not been and is not currently viable by the January 9, 2023 deadline.47 13. We agree that Pine Cellulars current choices for network deployment to the Choctaw Nation communities are not reasonable alternatives. Moreover, we find that strict application of the TLBC construction requirement, which would result in either Pine Cellulars repayment of its TLBC or automatic termination of its license, is not warranted.48 Neither the repayment of the TLBC nor the automatic termination of the license would facilitate the provision of wireless broadband service to the Choctaw Nation communities, and thus would not serve the public interest or the underlying purpose of the TLBC rule. We also find that grant of a waiver to Pine Cellular under these circumstances is consistent with prior TLBC construction deadline waiver requests granted by the Bureau.49 14. With respect to the length of the extension, we determine that extending Pine Cellulars construction deadline one year, until January 9, 2024, is sufficient and decline to extend its TLBC buildout date so that this deadline is the same as the one-year deadline for the Companys completion of the permanent removal, replacement, and disposal of covered communications equipment pursuant to the 43 Id. at 11. Although Pine Cellular began placing orders in January 2022 for needed replacements for the Huawei equipment throughout its existing network, it states that it had received only 80 percent of the orders as of October 2022 because of the unprecedented demand for semiconductors and the vendors inability to obtain semiconductors in sufficient quantities to construct equipment and fill pending orders in a timely fashion. Id. at 10-11. 44 Id. at 11, citing 47 CFR  54.9 prohibiting use of Universal Service funds for covered equipment. We further note that since the filing of Pine Cellulars Third Extension Request, the Commission has adopted its proposal to prohibit authorization of equipment that has been identified on the Commissions Covered List. See generally Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain through the Equipment Authorization Program, Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain through the Competitive Bidding Program ET Docket No. 21-232, EA Docket No. 21-233 Report and Order, Order, and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking FCC 22-84 2022. 45 Third Extension Request at 11. 46 Id. at 11-12. 47 Id. at 12. 48 47 CFR  1.2110f3viii. Any licensee that fails to provide the post-construction certification demonstrating it met its TLBC buildout obligation in a timely manner must repay the bidding credit amount in its entirety, plus interest, within 30 days of the deadline, or face automatic termination of its license. With imposition of these penalties, a licensees commitment to serve the Tribal land is no longer applicable. 49 For example, the Bureau has granted extensions due to lack of available equipment that meets regulatory requirements. See LL License Holdings, LLC Waiver Request for Extension of Time for Wireless Services, Call Signs WQKH490 and WQKH491 File Numbers 0005204801 and 0005204802, Order, 30 FCC Rcd 1937 2015 granting additional time for TLBC buildout due to lack of available interoperable 700 MHz equipment Space Data Spectrum Holdings, LLC, AWS Station WQIA880, A Block, Alaska 1Wade Hampton CMA, Request for Waiver and Extension of Time of Tribal Land Bidding Credit Construction Requirement, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 29 FCC Rcd 3523 2014 granting additional time for TLBC buildout due to lack of suitable Advanced Wireless Services equipment. 13 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-3 Reimbursement Program, including any related extensions.50 At the time Pine Cellular filed this Third Extension Request, it expected that by the end of 2022 it would have received sufficient compliant equipment from its suppliers to enable the removal, replacement, and disposal of covered communications equipment, and committed to giving first priority to its existing network facilities in the Choctaw Nation communities.51 We believe that, with this one-year extension, Pine Cellular will have sufficient time to determine how it can navigate equipment supply chain issues and serve the Choctaw Nation communities while meeting Commission requirements. IV. CONCLUSION 15. Pine Cellular has demonstrated that an extension of its TLBC construction deadline is warranted under the standards contained in sections 1.925 and 1.946 of the Commissions rules. We grant Pine Cellular a waiver of section 1.2110f3vii of the Commissions rules and extend the TLBC construction deadline until January 9, 2024, for Call Sign WRAM805. Notification that such construction has been completed must be filed with the Commission within fifteen 15 days of the deadline, by January 24, 2024. V. ORDERING CLAUSES 16. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that pursuant to Section 4i of the Communications Act, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  154i, and sections 1.925, 1.946, and 1.2110f3 of the Commissions Rules, 47 CFR  1.925, 1.946, and 1.2110f3, the Request for Limited Waiver and Further Extension of Time to Satisfy the Construction Requirement, Call Sign WRAM805, filed by Pine Cellular Phones, Inc. on October 25, 2022, is GRANTED to the extent described herein. 17.

Petition for Declaratory Ruling, Declaratory Ruling and Memorandum Opinion and Order, 34 FCC Rcd 10504 2019 Hemisphere Declaratory Ruling. The Amended  Restated Petition made clear that Searchlight II HMT was seeking a new ruling under section 310b4 of the Act and section 1.5000 et seq. of the Commissions rules, but to the extent necessary, requested the Commission to reissue its approval for foreign entities andor individuals, in the aggregate, to hold up to 100 percent of HMTVs equity and voting interests. See 47 CFR  1.5000 et seq. The Hemisphere Declaratory Ruling provided specific approval for certain foreign investors, but the interests held by those investors were acquired by Gato Investments LP Gato in connection with a take-private transaction that was consummated on September 13, 2022. Upon the closing of that transaction, 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of HMTV became indirectly owned by Gato, and HMTV became no longer publicly traded. See LMS File No. 0000191021.

TU Transaction.5 The Petition lays out the proposed post-closing ownership of HMTV, Televicentro, and WLIIWSUR in light of the HMTV and TU Transactions.6 Upon the closing of the wind-up of Gato, Searchlight II HMT will hold 100 percent of the membership interests in HWK Parent, LLC, and will indirectly hold 100 percent of the equity and voting interests in HMTV.7 At the same time as the closing of the HMTV Transaction, Searchlight Capital II EXU AIV, L.P., Searchlight Capital II PV, L.P., and SC II HMT, L.P., which each hold warrants in Searchlight II HMT, will exercise their respective warrants and will be issued new limited partnership interests in Searchlight II HMT.8 As a result, each of these investment fund vehicles will hold indirect equity interests in HMTV.9 Conversion of the warrants to equity interests will cause attribution of foreign ownership interests indirectly in HMTV through certain Searchlight investment fund entities organized in the Cayman Islands and that are ultimately controlled by foreign individuals, as well as through the foreign limited partners in each of the investment fund entities.10 In addition, the proposed TU Transaction will ultimately result in the transfer of control of the WLIIWSUR broadcast radio stations to HMTV.11 HMTV is the parent of Intermedia Espaol, Inc. Intermedia Espaol, and HMTV and Intermedia Espaol will be directly ultimately controlled by Searchlight II HMT.12 Pursuant to section 1.5001h of the Commissions rules, the Petitioner requests approval of up to an aggregate 100 indirect foreign ownership of the controlling U.S. parent, HMTV.13 In the Petition, Searchlight II HMT requests specific approval14 for certain foreign individuals and entities that will hold, indirectly, more than five percent of the equity andor voting interests of HMTV and advance approval15 for each individual and entity to increase their interests in HMTV to certain percentages at some future time.16 Specifically, the Petition makes the following requests for advance approval Erol Uzumeri Canada to hold up to 49.9 equity and be deemed to hold 100 voting Oliver Haarmann Germany to hold up to 49.9 equity and be deemed to hold 100 voting Searchlight Capital II PV, L.P.

Searchlight provides management and other advisory services to Searchlight-affiliated investment funds in return for a fee.19 Nonetheless, the Petition asserts that Searchlight has no economic ownership interest in the investment funds and has no decision-making authority with respect to their operations.20 The Petition asserts that all management and decision-making authority with respect to the funds rests with the general partners of the funds.21 Petitioner states that Searchlight is controlled by its general partner, Searchlight Capital Partners, LLC Delaware, which is controlled by its three members, Messrs. Eric Zinterhofer United States, Eric Uzumeri Canada, and Oliver Haarmann Germany.22 These same three individuals are also the only limited partners of Searchlight.23 All other funds that Searchlight manages are also controlled by Messrs. Zinterhofer, Uzumeri, and Haarmann.24 Petitioner states that aside from Mr. Zinterhofer, neither Searchlight, nor any of its employees have any active or direct role at HMTV or its subsidiaries.25 The Petition has been found, on initial review, to be acceptable for filing. The Commission may require Searchlight II HMT, L.P. to submit additional documents or statements of fact that in the Commissions judgment may be necessary.

WC Docket No. 21-191 Tariff F.C.C. No. 3   Transmittal No. 17 MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER Adopted January 4, 2023 Released January 4, 2023 By the Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau I. INTRODUCTION 1. In this Order, we approve the plan submitted by Core Communications, Inc. Core to refund certain interstate access service charges Core assessed certain interexchange carriers IXCs pursuant to its unlawful tariff.1 This Order follows the Core Tariff Investigation Order in which the Commission concluded the investigation into Cores tariff revisions, directed Core to revise its tariff, and directed the Wireline Competition Bureau Bureau to determine any refunds that may be required once the newly revised tariff is effective.2 II. BACKGROUND 2. Core is a competitive local exchange carrier LEC that serves as an intermediate carrier, primarily for toll free calls. As a competitive LEC, Core is permitted, but not required, to file interstate switched access service tariffs with the Commission.3 On April 22, 2021, Core filed Transmittal No. 17 Revised Tariff, revising various provisions of its interstate access services Tariff F.C.C. No. 3, including provisions regarding billing disputes, late-payment fees, cancellation, and toll free 8YY database query charges.4 Cores revisions included changes to section 2.10.5 of the tariff, which increased the monthly late-payment fee from a maximum of 1.5 to the lesser of 3.0 or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, if the unpaid amount is not part of a good faith dispute as described in the tariff.5 On May 6, 2021, the Bureau adopted the Suspension Order, finding that substantial questions existed 1 Letter from Carey Roesel, Consultant, Inteserra, Inc., to Marlene H.

Page No. 29,  2.10.5 filed Apr. 22, 2021. 20 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-5 regarding the lawfulness of Cores Revised Tariff that required further investigation.6 The Bureau suspended the Revised Tariff for one day, thereby allowing it to go into effect without being deemed lawful, adopted an accounting order, and initiated an investigation into the lawfulness of the Revised Tariff.7 3. On June 23, 2021, the Bureau released a Designation Order directing Core to provide information that the Commission needed to determine whether the late-payment fee provision was just and reasonable.8 Core then filed its Direct Case responding to the questions the Bureau asked in the Designation Order.9 ATT and Verizon filed oppositions to the Direct Case, arguing that Cores late- payment fee was unjust and unreasonable.10 4. In the Core Tariff Investigation Order, the Commission found, in relevant part, that Core failed to demonstrate that the late-payment fee provision in section 2.10.5 of the Revised Tariff was just and reasonable.11 The Commission found that the 3 late-payment fee was unreasonable, and that the reference to the highest rate permitted by applicable law was unlawful because the provision was impermissibly ambiguous, in violation of section 61.2 of the Commissions rules.12 Accordingly, the Commission found that the revisions to the tariff, including those to section 2.10.5, were not just and reasonable, as required by section 201b of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended the Act.13 The Commission, therefore, instructed Core to delete the revisions it made in Transmittal No. 17.14 The Commission also instructed the Bureau to 1 ensure that Core made the appropriate changes to its tariff to reflect the Commissions findings and 2 determine the amount of any refunds Core owed to its customers.15 6 Core Communication, Inc., et al., Tariff F.C.C.

The Bureau also directed Core to answer questions about its other tariff revisions, including revisions to the dispute resolution process, charges for services to customers to which it discontinues service, and charges for 8YY database queries when the underlying call is not completed. Id. at 10008-11, paras. 31-37, 39-41. 9 Direct Case of Core, WC Docket No. 21-191, Transmittal No. 17 filed July 14, 2021 Direct Case. 10 ATT Services, Inc.s Opposition to Direct Case of Core, WC Docket No. 21-191, Transmittal No. 17, at 25-26 filed July 28, 2021 ATT Opposition to Direct Case Verizons Opposition to the Direct Case of Core, WC Docket No. 21-191, Transmittal No. 17, at 20-21 filed July 28, 2021 Verizon Opposition to Direct Case. ATT also asserted that Core's dispute resolution provisions and database query provisions are unlawful. ATT Opposition to Direct Case at 10-24, 26-29. Verizon argued that Core failed to adequately respond to the Designation Order and violated Commission rules governing factual submissions. Verizon also argued that if the Commission addressed the tariff provisions on the merits, the Commission should reject each tariff provision as unlawful.

On October 15, 2021, Core filed tariff Transmittal No. 21, deleting the unlawful revisions it made to its tariff in Transmittal No. 17. Transmittal No. 21 became effective on October 30, 2021.16 The period during which the unlawful tariff was in effect the Refund Period, therefore, is May 7, 2021 the day after the Suspension Order was released through October 29, 2021 the day before Transmittal No. 21 became effective. 6. Core filed a proposed Refund Plan on June 29, 2022, which calculated the reductions Core would make to its late-payment fees during the Refund Period.17 We sought comment on Cores proposed Refund Plan.18 Verizon filed an Opposition asking the Commission to reject the Refund Plan and instead direct Core to submit a revised plan under which Core would collect no late-payment fees during the Refund Period.19 Otherwise, it claimed, Core would suffer no consequences for its unlawful tariff filing.20 ATT filed a comment urging the Commission not to disturb any of the findings it made in its Core Orders, or otherwise address the specifics of any payment disputes between Core and ATT.21 III. DISCUSSION 7. We find that the refunds proposed in Cores Refund Plan are reasonable and properly reflect the findings in the Core Tariff Investigation Order.22 We reject arguments made by Verizon in its Opposition, which seek relief inconsistent with section 204 of the Act, and address issues ATT raised in its comment concerning the potential effect of this Order on pending disputes.23 8. In its Refund Plan and attached spreadsheet, Core calculates the specific amounts it will refund to individual customers as a result of having assessed an unlawfully high 3 monthly late- payment fee during the Refund Period24 instead of the 1.5 monthly late-payment fee ceiling that had previously been in effect.25 Cores spreadsheet provides the relevant invoice amounts necessary to support its calculations.26 16 Core Communications, Inc., et al., Tariff F.C.C.

We note that the Refund Plan Spreadsheet appears to contain certain typographical errors in the Interest Rate Adjustment worksheet that do not affect the calculation of the refunds. Commenting parties neither noted nor objected to these errors. 22 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-5 9. Core incorrectly argues that it is not making any refunds, and is only making downward adjustments to the outstanding balances of some of its customers.27 Cores attempt to distinguish between the term refunds and its planned downward adjustments is a distinction without substance and does not affect its refund obligations pursuant to the Core Tariff Investigation Order. Moreover, in a section 204 tariff investigation proceeding, refunds are not restricted to cash payments but may also include a variety of forms of non-cash payment. For example, in the South Dakota Network SDN tariff investigation, the Bureau directed SDN to make a refund in the form of a credit on the invoices of affected customers.28 In this tariff investigation, the refunds Core is required to make take the form of reductions to customers late-payment fees, another form of non-cash payment. Put simply, those reductions are the refunds contemplated by the Commission in the Core Tariff Investigation Order. 10. Verizon asks the Commission to reject the Refund Plan, direct Core to submit a new plan, and bar Core from assessing any late-payment fees during the Refund Period.29 Verizon argues that Cores Revised Tariff imposed substantial costs on other carriers and on the Commission, and that Core should face consequences that deter the filing of such unlawful tariffs in the first place.30 Verizon essentially is asking the Commission to award damages similar to punitive damages by requiring Core to forgo the 1.5 monthly late-payment fee that its tariff would otherwise allow during the Refund Period. Verizon does not contend that the 1.5 late-payment fee is unlawful, only that it and other customers should be granted other relief to dissuade Core from future unlawful tariff filings. But section 204 of the Act grants the Commission the authority to order refunds, not punitive damages.31 Further, Verizon makes no argument that Cores Refund Plan would not adequately compensate carriers for excessive charges they incurred as a result of Transmittal No. 17. We therefore deny Verizons request to direct Core to submit a revised refund plan that imposes no late-payment fees during the Refund Period.32 11. In its comment, ATT raises concerns about the potential impact of this Order on prior Commission decisions concerning Cores tariffs, and pending litigation between Core and ATT.33 We affirm that this Order neither modifies the Commissions previous findings in this or any other related proceedings nor addresses pending litigation. 12. We find that the refunds proposed by Core are sufficient to implement the Commissions decision in the Core Tariff Investigation Order. Core explains that it made no other changes to its 27 Refund Plan at 2 There is no refundonly a downward adjustment . . . .. 28 July 1, 2018 Annual Access Charge Tariff Filings South Dakota Network, LLC, Tariff F.C.C.

Verizon Refund Plan Opposition at 2 47 U.S.C.  204a3. But a rate that is deemed lawful can be evaluated as to its future effect under sections 205 and 208 of the Act, and the Commission may prescribe a rate as to the future under section 205.

We, therefore, approve Cores proposal to lower the monthly late-payment fee from the 3 Core assessed during the Refund Period to 1.5 for the Refund Period, and direct Core to make those changes for the affected customers. This refund effectively eliminates any impact of the Revised Tariff on Cores customers35 and restores the status quo that existed prior to Cores filing of its Revised Tariff. IV. ORDERING CLAUSES 13.

On May 13, 2020, the Commission realigned the 900 MHz band to make available six megahertz of low-band spectrum for the development of critical wireless broadband technologies and services, while reserving the remaining four megahertz of spectrum for continued narrowband operations.1 In accordance with the 900 MHz Report and Order,2 the Bureau announced that the opening date for acceptance of 900 MHz broadband segment applications began on May 27, 2021.3 The Bureau finds the 900 MHz broadband segment applications listed in the Appendix to be complete and in conformance with the Commissions rules. No petitions to deny these applications were filed, and the applications sufficiently demonstrate conformance with the eligibility conditions Eligibility Certification and requirements for transitioning the 900 MHz band in the particular county requested Transition Plan.4 Furthermore, the Commission has received full anti-windfall payments for the licenses listed in the Appendix, as required by section 27.1503c2. Therefore, the Bureau finds that granting the applications for the 900 MHz broadband segment licenses listed in the Appendix serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity.

It is organized under, and operates in accordance with, the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act FACA.2 Opening a new, dedicated docket will enable the public to more easily access materials related to the NANC going forward. Ex Parte Exemptions and Filings. Under the FACA, the Commission is responsible for oversight of the NANC, including its working groups and any subcommittees.3 As a result, FCC Commissioners and staff may participate in or attend meetings or other activities held by both the NANC and its working groups and subcommittees. For this reason, pursuant to section 1.1200a of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  1.1200a, presentations to the NANC, including to its working groups and subcommittees, and at any roundtable discussions sponsored by the NANC, as well as presentations between NANC members including members of any working groups and subcommittees and FCC Commissioners or staff incidental to and in connection with such NANC meetings or roundtable discussions, will be treated as exempt presentations for ex parte purposes.4 This exemption covers presentations from NANC members to FCC Commissioners and staff in other settings only to the extent that the NANC members are presenting the views of the NANC or its working groups, as opposed to an individual members own views or that of a members organization.

INTRODUCTION 1. By this Order, the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau Bureau of the Federal Communications Commission grants a request filed by seventeen groups and individuals for an extension of the time in which to file comments in response to the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Further Notice in this docket. As determined by the date of publication in the Federal Register, comments and reply comments were originally due on January 17, 2023 and February 14, 2023, respectively. Pursuant to this Order, we extend the comment date 30 days to February 16, 2023. Reply comments are now due March 16, 2023. II. BACKGROUND 2. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Register published a summary1 of Empowering Broadband Consumers Through Transparency, CG Docket No. 22-2, Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.2 The Further Notice sets deadlines for filing comments and reply comments at 30 and 60 days after the date of publication of the summary of the Further Notice in the Federal Register. Consistent with the Further Notice, the Federal Register Notice states that comments are due no later than January 17, 2023, and reply comments are due no later than February 14, 2023.3 3. On December 21, 2022, Free Press and sixteen other groups and individuals submitted a request for a 60-day extension of time to the comment and reply comment deadlines.4 These parties assert that an extension to the comment deadline is reasonable and warranted in order to adequately develop the record in this proceeding.5 They observe that the comment period overlaps with the winter 1 Federal Communications Commission, Empowering Broadband Consumers Through Transparency, Proposed Rule, 87 Fed.

Reg. at 77048. 4 See Letter from Free Press, Benton Institute for Broadband  Society, Center for Democracy  Technology, Common Sense, Consumer Reports, Greenlining Institute, INCOMPAS, Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, National Broadband Mapping Coalition, National Consumer Law Center, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, New Americas Open Technology Institute, Next Century Cities, NTEN, OpenMedia, Public Knowledge, and Scott Jordan, to Erica H. McMahon, Federal Communications Commission, December 21, 2022 Extension Request. 5 Extension Request at 1. 32 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-9 holiday season in addition to other important broadband-related deadlines, including the deadline for challenges to the broadband availability maps and a Federal Trade Commission FTC deadline for comments on its junk fees proceeding.6 The parties assert that an extension would enable people to participate in all relevant proceedings, which would benefit the Commission, comity with the FTC, and the public interest.7 Finally, they argue that an additional 60 days would provide reasonable accommodation for the many public interest advocates, civil rights organizations, researchers, data experts, and consumers whose voices should be heard in this proceeding.8 III. DISCUSSION 4. As set forth in section 1.46 of the Commissions rules, it is the policy of the Commission that extensions of time shall not be routinely granted.9 However, extensions may be considered to the extent that good cause for an extension is demonstrated.10 The criteria for granting requests for extensions of time are that the extension be in the public interest, cause no harm to any party in the proceeding, and cause no significant delay.11 The Commission has previously found that an extension of time is warranted when it is necessary to ensure that the Commission receives full and informed responses and that affected parties have a meaningful opportunity to develop a complete record for the Commissions consideration.12 5. We find good cause to grant an extension. Christmas Day, New Years Day, and the Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. are all within the comment period, shortening the normal time for drafting and filing comments. We agree with Free Press and the others that an extension will more fully develop the record in this proceeding while affording commenters more ability to participate in other important, consumer-oriented proceedings. 6. We disagree with the petitioners that a full two months is necessary in this case. We find that an extension of 30 days better balances the needs the petitioners describe and timely action on the Label. We therefore find that a 30-day extension is appropriate.13 Accordingly, comments are due on or before February 16, 2023, and reply comments are due on or before March 16, 2023. 7.

On August 29, 2022, the Federal Communications Commission Commission completed the auction of new flexible-use geographic overlay licenses in the 2.5 GHz band, and the Office of Economics and Analytics OEA and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau WTB announced the results of that auction on September 1, 2022.1 This auction raised a total of 419,133,261 in net bids and 427,789,670 in gross bids, with 63 bidders winning a total of 7,872 licenses.2 Long-form applications for licenses won in Auction 108 were due on September 16, 2022.3 WTB accepted these four Auction 108 applications for filing on December 8, 2022.4 Upon further review and examination, WTB finds the applications for the licenses listed in Attachment A to be complete and in conformance with the Commissions rules. We find that granting the applications for the licenses listed in Attachment A serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity. Furthermore, the Commission has received full payment for the licenses listed in Attachment A, as required by section 1.2109a of its rules.5 Accordingly, by this Public Notice, we announce the grant of the licenses listed in Attachment A.

INTRODUCTION 1. By this Order, the Wireline Competition Bureau Bureau grants a Motion filed by the Cloud Communications Alliance, NCTA  The Internet  Television Association, NTCA  The Rural Broadband Association, USTelecom  The Broadband Association, the Voice on the Net Coalition, and WTA  Advocates for Rural Broadband seeking an extension of 12 days for filing reply comments in the above-captioned proceeding.1 II. BACKGROUND 2. On October 27, 2022, the Commission adopted a Notice of Inquiry to seek comment on caller ID authentication for non-Internet Protocol IP networks.2 To further the Commissions efforts to protect Americans from illegally spoofed robocalls, the Notice sought focused comment on potential authentication solutions for non-IP networks and the nexus between non-IP caller ID authentication and the IP transition generally.3 Interested parties were required to file their initial comments by December 12, 2022 and their reply comments by January 11, 2023. 3. Pursuant to section 1.46 of the Commissions rules,4 Cloud Communications Alliance, NCTA, NTCA, USTelecom, the Voice on the Net Coalition, and WTA filed a joint motion for an extension of time on December 22, 2022 to submit their reply comments. As justifications for the extension, the parties point to the complexity of issues raised in the Notice and the initial round of comments and the challenges caused by key staff taking leave during the holiday season.5 Many of the companies potentially affected by this proceeding, the parties argue, are smaller companies with limited resources that are unable to provide significant feedback over this holiday period.6 III. DISCUSSION 4. As set forth in section 1.46 of the Commissions rules, it is the policy of the Commission that extensions of time shall not be routinely granted.7 However, the Commission may consider an 1 Motion of Cloud Communications Alliance, NCTA, NTCA, USTelecom, the Voice on the Net Coalition, and WTA for Extension of Time, WC Docket No. 17-97 filed Dec. 22, 2022 Dec. 22 Extension Request. 2 Call Authentication Trust Anchor, WC Docket No. 17-97, Notice of Inquiry, FCC 22-81 rel.

Here, the Bureau finds good cause to grant the extension request. The holiday season, including two Federal holidays,11 fell within the reply comment period, and the Bureau is cognizant of the challenges this poses to commenters, specifically smaller companies with more limited resources over the holiday season. The Bureau finds that an extension of 12 days to file reply comments is warranted to allow interested parties the time to meaningfully review and reply to the information in the record, and that this brief extension will not harm any party in the proceeding nor cause a significant delay in the Commissions ability to consider the issues raised in this proceeding in a timely manner.12 Thus, the Bureau extends the deadline for the filing of reply comments until January 23, 2023. 6.

Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to sections 0.204, 0.291, and 1.46 of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  0.204, 0.291, 1.46, that the Motion for Extension of the Reply Comment deadline is hereby GRANTED. 9. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the date for filing reply comments in response to the Notice is EXTENDED to January 23, 2023.

INTRODUCTION 1. In this Order, the Wireline Competition Bureau Bureau addresses the petition of VPNet, Inc. VPNet,1 seeking a limited waiver of the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program EBB Program reimbursement rules. VPNet requests a waiver of the requirement that it certify reimbursement by the 15th of the month2 for the October 2021 service month.3 2. Based on our established waiver standard, we grant VPNet a waiver to submit certified claims for the October 2021 service month by February 15, 2023. In addition, we grant, on our own motion, a limited waiver to participating providers that uploaded, but did not certify, their reimbursement claims for discounted service provided in the December 2021, January 2022, and February 2022 service months by their respective claims deadlines. This limited waiver will allow the limited number of affected providers to certify any such previously uploaded claims for the December 2021, January 2022, and February 2022 service months by February 15, 2023. We conclude that these limited waivers are consistent with the Programs statutory requirements and will serve the public interest. II. DISCUSSION 3. As a general matter, an agency must adhere to its own rules and regulations.4 Although strict application of a rule may be justified to preserve incentives for compliance and to realize the benefits of easy administration that the rule was designed to achieve,5 the Commissions rules may be waived for good cause shown.6 The Commission may exercise its discretion to waive a rule where special circumstances warrant a deviation from the general rule, and such deviation will serve the public interest.7 The Commission may take into account considerations of hardship, equity, or more effective implementation of overall policy on an individual basis.8 The Bureau, under delegated authority, may act on requests for waiver of rules.9 1 VPNet, Inc. Petition for Waiver, WC Docket No. 20-445 filed June 8, 2022 VPNet Waiver Petition. 2 47 CFR  54.1608g. 3 VPNet Waiver Petition at 1. 4 NetworkIP, LLC v. FCC, 548 F.3d 116, 127 D.C.

Cir. 1990. 8 Northeast Cellular, 897 F.2d at 1166 WAIT Radio v. FCC, 418 F.2d 1153, 1159 D.C. Cir. 1969. 47 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-14 4. To receive reimbursement under the EBB Program rules, providers must submit certified reimbursement claims through the Lifeline Claims System by the 15th of each month, or the following business day in the event the 15th is a holiday or falls on a weekend.10 If the participating provider fails to submit a certified reimbursement claim by the deadline for that service month, the reimbursement claim will not be processed.11 The Bureau has previously released waivers on June 8, 2021,12 August 10, 2021,13 September 3, 2021,14 and February 11, 2022,15 that allowed providers additional time to file certified reimbursement claims. 5. Based on the record before us, we grant the limited waiver request of VPNet. We will permit VPNet an extension of time until February 15, 2023 to submit certified reimbursement claims for its October 2021 service month claims. VPNet requests a limited waiver of the certification requirement for the October 2021 service month.16 VPNet says that it began processing its claims for the October 2021 service month on November 11, 2021, but was unable to successfully upload the Claims Input Template.17 VPNet argues that good cause exists to grant a waiver of the reimbursement rules because VPNet took steps that should have been sufficient to timely complete and certify its reimbursement claim for the October 2021 service month.18 VPNet further argues that grant of a waiver will avoid a miscarriage of justice and further provide assurance to participating providers that continued participation in the EBB Program and its successor program the Affordable Connectivity Program ACP will not expose them to undue risk of economic harm.19 VPNet further states that granting a waiver will not undermine the EBB Program or ACP.20 6. Based on the record before us, the Bureau finds that good cause exists for a limited waiver of the requirement of section 54.1608g of the Commissions rules to permit VPNet to submit certified reimbursement claims for the October 2021 service month by February 15, 2023.

We also find that granting this waiver to VPNet should neither undermine any program integrity controls, nor invite waste, fraud, and abuse because VPNet will still only be able to claim reimbursement for subscribers that completed the eligibility verification process and did receive discounted service. This waiver is limited to VPNets claims for the October 2021 service month. 7. Additionally, the Bureau, on its own motion, grants a limited waiver to allow those EBB Program providers that uploaded but did not certify their claims for the December 2021, January 2022, and February 2022 service months by their respective claims deadline additional time to complete the certification process. Those providers will have until February 15, 2023 to submit certified reimbursement claims for discounts provided in the December 2021, January 2022, and February 2022 service months. 8. Based on the record before us, the Bureau finds that good cause exists for a limited waiver of the requirement of section 54.1608g of the Commissions rules to permit providers that uploaded their reimbursement claims for the December 2021, January 2022, and February 2022 service months by January 18, 2022, February 15, 2022, and March 15, 2022 respectively, but failed to certify those claims by those respective deadlines, until February 15, 2023 to certify such claims. We find that it is in the public interest to allow these providers the opportunity to certify their submitted reimbursement claims, given the substantial hardship they may face if not allowed to seek reimbursement. We also find that granting this waiver should not undermine any program integrity controls, nor invite waste, fraud, and abuse. This waiver is limited to participating providers that successfully uploaded their reimbursement claims for the December 2021, January 2022, and February 2022 service months for discounted service provided to qualified subscribers, but did not certify them, thus ensuring that the providers claimed subscribers were in fact enrolled in National Lifeline Accountability Database NLAD as of the snapshot date on the 1st of the month and that the provider had made a good faith effort at identifying and claiming reimbursement for those subscribers by the deadline.

This action is taken by the Chief, Media Bureau, pursuant to authority delegated by sections 0.61 and 0.283 of the Commissions rules.2 - FCC - 1 See 47 CFR  25.601, 25.701, 25.702, 73.3526 73.3527 and 76.1700. 2 47 CFR  0.61 and 0.283. 52 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-17 Before the Federal Communications Commission Washington, D.C. 20554 In the Matter of   Amendment of Section 73.622j,  MB Docket No. 22-146 Table of Allotments, Television Broadcast  RM-11925 Stations Memphis, Tennessee   REPORT AND ORDER Proceeding Terminated Adopted January 9, 2023 Released January 9, 2023 By the Chief, Video Division, Media Bureau 1. The Video Division, Media Bureau Bureau, has before it a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking1 issued in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by Gray Television Licensee, LLC Gray or Petitioner,2 the licensee of television station WMC-TV WMC-TV or Station, channel 5, Memphis, Tennessee. The Petitioner has requested the substitution of UHF channel 30 for VHF channel 5 in the Table of TV Allotments.3 The Petitioner filed comments in support of the petition, as required by the Commissions rules rules,4 reaffirming its commitment to apply for channel 30. No other comments were received. 2. We believe the public interest would be served by substituting channel 30 for channel 5 at Memphis, Tennessee. The Petitioner states that the proposed channel substitution resolves significant over-the-air reception problems in WMC-TVs service area due to its operation on a low VHF channel, reception problems which the Commission has recognized exist on VHF channels.5 An analysis using the Commissions TVStudy software tool indicates that WMC-TVs move from channel 5 to channel 30 is predicted to create an area where 4,072 persons may lose service. The loss area, however, is largely overlapped by the noise limited contours of other NBC affiliated stations and most viewers will continue 1 Amendment of Section 73.622j, Table of Allotments, Television Stations Memphis, Tennessee, MB Docket No. 22-146, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, DA 21-694 rel. Apr. 5, 2022 NPRM. 2 Petition of Gray Television Licensee, LLC for Rulemaking, as amended filed Nov. 27, 2020, LMS File No. 0000127522 Petition. Gray requested confidential treatment for certain information contained in the November 2020 Petition pursuant to sections 0.459 and 0.457 of the Commissions rules rules, 47 CFR  0.457, 0.459, and the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.  552. Gray amended the November 2020 Petition on February 10, 2022 Amended Petition and Supplemental Engineering Statement to provide a supplemental engineering statement with a further analysis of the population served by the proposed channel 30 facility, and to report that it had acquired three low power television LPTV stations which it intended to modify to better serve the predicted loss areas. Because the Amended Petition and Supplemental Engineering Statement did not include the confidential information or the legal and economic arguments on which it was based, we dismissed the November 2020 Petition. NPRM at n.1 and para. 17. 3 47 CFR  73.622j. 4 47 CFR  1.415, 1.419 see also Buffalo, Iola, Normangee, and Madisonville, Texas, MB Docket No. 07-729, Report and Order, 24 FCC Rcd 8192, 8194, para. 9 Aud. Div. 2009. 5 Amended Petition at 3 NPRM at para. 2. 53 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-17 to receive service from five or more stations,6 In addition, the Petitioner acquired three LPTV stations WANF-LD, Dyersburg, Tennessee channel 32 WDDY-LD, Jackson, Tennessee channel 15 and W20DW-D, Clarksdale, Mississippi channel 20 and constructed modified facilities to deliver NBC programming to viewers in the loss area.7 As a result, only 64 persons would either 1 no longer receive NBC network programming or 2 no longer receive service from five or more full power television services.8 In practice, Gray expects that few, if any, persons who are currently able to receive WMC- TVs over-the-air signal on channel 5 would no longer be able to receive WMC-TVs over-the-air signal as a result of the Stations transition to channel 30.9 3. As proposed, channel 30 can be substituted for channel 5 at Memphis, Tennessee, in compliance with the principal community coverage requirements of section 73.625a of the rules,10 at coordinates 35 10' 09\" N and 89 53' 10\" W. Although the Petitioners proposal would result in a loss for a limited number of viewers, we find that the overall benefits of the proposed channel change outweighs any possible harm to the public interest when taking into account the ability of all but a de minimis number of viewers to access NBC programming from another source. In addition, we find that this channel change meets the technical requirements set forth in sections 73.616 and 73.623 of the rules with the following specifications11 City and State Channel Power kW Antenna HAAT m Service Pop. Memphis, Tennessee 30 515 307.7 1,556,336 4. We also conclude that good cause exists to make this channel change effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, pursuant to section 553d3 of the Administrative Procedure Act.12 An expedited effective date is necessary in this case to ensure that WMC-TV can operate with improved service to its viewers as quickly as possible. 5. Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in sections 4i, 5c1, 303g, r and 307b of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  154i, 155c1, 303g, r, and 307b, and sections 0.61, 0.204b and 0.283 of the rules, 47 CFR  0.61, 0.204b, and 0.283, IT IS ORDERED, That effective immediately upon the date of publication in the Federal Register, the Table of 6 These stations are WTVA, Tupelo, Mississippi channel 11, licensed to Mississippi TV License Company LLC KAIT, Jonesboro, Arkansas channel 27, licensed to the Petitioner and WNBJ-LD, Jackson, Tennessee channel 16, licensed to CTT Licensee LLC. Supplemental Engineering Exhibit, Figures 2, 3. 7 Gray amended its Petition on December 29, 2022, to confirm that the three LPTV stations have been built and licensed, and that these stations are now operating and serving the predicted loss areas. See LMS File Nos. 0000205962, 0000203485, and 0000199038. While these LPTV stations, as well as WNBJ-LD referenced above, supra note 7, are secondary and can be displaced, we believe that it is unlikely that these stations would be displaced and, if they were, the licensees would be able to find displacement channels for them. See NPRM at n.5. 8 Amended Petition at 5 Supplemental Engineering Statement at 4-5, Figure 3. The Commission has previously stated that it is generally most concerned where there is a loss of an areas only network or NCE TV service, or where the loss results in an area becoming less that well-served, i.e., served by fewer than five full-power stations.

Id. at 4. 12 Id. at 3. New Alpha states that the Warrants carry no voting rights, confer no rights to economic distributions, and are convertible instruments that by their terms may be exercised only if consistent with the Communications Act. Id. at 3, n.6. 13 Id. at 4. The foreign equity and voting percentages include interests held directly and indirectly in New Alpha. The remaining 3.6 voting and equity interests in New Alpha are held by non-attributable interest holders. See Attach. C-1. 57 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-18 would require specific approval.14 New Alpha estimates that if the Commission were to grant the Petition and the Warrants are fully exercised, it would have foreign ownership of more than 70 on both an equity and voting basis.15 The Petition seeks authorization for up to 100 aggregate foreign voting and equity investment in order to permit flexibility for New Alpha to take on additional foreign ownership in the future. After the exercise of the Warrants, five entities will hold the following direct attributable interests in New Alpha 1 MPEH 23.6 equity 25 voting16 FGH 7.9 equity 8.3 voting17 3 HLSOF 7.9 equity 8.3 voting18 4 ICGNA 39.1 equity 41.4 voting19 and 5 BigSur Capital Partners Three Corp.

New Alpha expects that the holders of more than 91 of its Warrants will exercise their Warrants following grant of the Petition. Id. at 7. New Alpha states that one group of its Warrant holders has indicated that it does not intend to exercise its Warrants, but even considering the groups Warrants on a fully diluted basis, the group would not hold an interest in New Alpha that requires specific approval. Id. New Alpha also states that two additional New Alpha Warrant holders, which are indirectly commonly controlled by a Cayman Islands limited partnership, hold Warrants that, if fully exercised, would cause the partnership to hold an indirect voting and equity interest of more than 5. New Alpha explains, however, that the holders have indicated that they intend to transfer a sufficient number of Warrants or take other action to ensure that the Cayman Islands partnerships interest does not exceed 5 percent of Alphas voting or equity and, thus, does not require specific approval. Id. According to New Alpha, these two Warrant holders are U.S. insurance companies whose combined interest represents an approximately 5.75 interest in New Alpha calculated on a fully-diluted basis. Second Supplement at 3. Aside from the interests held indirectly through the insurance companies and a de minimis interest held through an insulated limited partner of ICG North American Private Debt Fund LP see First Supplement at 5, n.10 the Cayman Island partnerships hold no other direct or indirect interests in New Alpha. Second Supplement at 3-4, n.11. Further, in addition to committing to reduce their combined interest to less than 5, New Alpha asserts that specific approval is not required for these entities as they hold less than a 10 interest in New Alpha a privately held company are prohibited from becoming actively involved in New Alpha and hold rights equal to or less than minority shareholder protections permitted by the Commissions rules. Second Supplement at 3-4. In addition, New Alpha indicates that it has entered into an agreement with the insurance companies reaffirming the limitations on the involvement of those entities.

C-5. 21 In the Petition, New Alpha indicated that MPEH had a Japanese affiliate, MetLife Insurance, K.K. MIK. According to New Alpha, the interests held by MIK were to be transferred to MPEH prior to the exercise of Warrants, and accordingly, MIK would not require specific approval. See Petition at 8, 13. By its Second Supplement, New Alpha has confirmed that MIK has assigned all of the warrants and stock MIK received at Alphas continued. 58 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-18 approval for BigSur, ICGNA, and the four ICGNA-affiliated foreign entities to hold up to 49.99 of New Alphas equity andor voting interests.22 The ownership of these entities, and projected equity and voting interests in New Alpha, is discussed below.23 New Alpha states that neither MPEH, FGH, HLSOF, nor any of the entities or individuals in each of those entitys ownership structure, require specific approval.24 New Alpha argues that grant of the Petition will serve the public interest by enabling it to better compete in the media marketplace, incentivizing foreign investment in broadcasting, and promoting U.S. trade policy by encouraging reciprocal investment opportunities for U.S. companies in foreign markets, while avoiding any risks to national security, law enforcement, or foreign or trade policy.25 New Alpha emphasizes that the proposed foreign owners of interests requiring specific approval are organized under the laws of the United Kingdom, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, and Jersey, all of which are allies of the United States and investors in its economy, and with which the U.S. is engaged in robust reciprocal trade.26 ICGNA and Affiliated Foreign Entities As proposed in the Petition, ICGNA, a Cayman Islands corporation, will hold an approximate 39.1 direct equity interest and 41.4 direct voting interest in New Alpha. The following four foreign entities affiliated with ICGNA will hold the following indirect equity and voting interests in New Alpha, and therefore, also require specific approval 1 Intermediate Capital Group PLC ICG PLC, a United Kingdom private limited company 10.6 equity 46.7 voting 2 ICG FMC Limited ICG FMC, a United Kingdom private limited company 0 equity 43.2 voting 3 ICG Global Investment Jersey Limited ICG Jersey, a Jersey registered private company 7.3 equity 7.7 voting and 4 ICG Global Investment UK Limited ICG UK, a United Kingdom private limited company 7.3 equity 7.7 voting.27 New Alpha also seeks authorization for ICGNA, ICG PLC, ICG FMC, ICG Jersey, and ICG UK to hold up to 49.99 of New Alphas equity andor voting interests.28 The ownership structure of ICGNA and its affiliated entities is detailed below. emergence from bankruptcy to MEH. Second Supplement at 1- 2, Attach. A providing copies of the executed assignment of warrants and stock. New Alpha indicates that MIK assigned its interests to MPEH ten days after the filing of the Petition and no longer holds any interest in Alpha, and therefore does not require specific approval. Id. at 2. 22 See id. at 16  nn.40-41. 23 See also Petition, Attach. E listing each entity or individual for which specific approval is requested. 24 Id. at 13-15 Supplement at 2-3  Attach. A. New Alpha explains that although MPEH, FGH, and HLSOF themselves have some foreign ownership and thus contribute modest amounts of foreign ownership to New Alphas aggregate foreign ownership . . . no entity affiliated with these U.S. Owners requires specific approval. Petition at 8. None of the foreign owners will hold more than a 5 percent indirect voting or equity interest in New Alpha and, accordingly, none will require specific approval under the Commissions rules. Petition at 13-15. 25 Id. at 2, 17-25. New Alpha states that the important public interest benefits with enabling greater foreign investment in communications companies take on added significance in the context of a company, such as New Alpha, that has recently restructured its debt load through the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. Id. at 19. According to New Alpha, permitting the conversion of debt to equity or warrants to equity following the grant of any necessary declaratory ruling will serve the important goal of incentivizing . . . foreign debt investments in companies subject to the Communication Acts foreign ownership limitations, allowing such companies to emerge in a stronger economic position. Id. 26 Id. at 23. 27 See id. at 16  Attach. E. New Alpha states that the projected equity and voting percentages are approximate and may differ from what is reported at the closing of the transaction, but that it will supplement the Petition to the extent it determines that any material changes are likely to occur. Id. 28 See id. at 16  nn.40-41. 59 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-18 ICG Jersey holds a 18.57 equity and voting interest in ICGNA. Following the exercise of ICGNAs Warrants, ICG Jersey will hold an approximate 7.3 equity and 7.7 voting interest in New Alpha, indirectly through ICGNA. Therefore ICG Jersey, a foreign entity, requires specific approval.29 ICG Jersey is wholly owned by ICG UK, also a foreign entity, and therefore ICG UK, through its ownership of ICG Jersey, similarly holds an indirect 7.3 equity and 7.7 voting interest in New Alpha that requires specific approval under the Commissions rules.30 ICG North American Private Debt Fund LP ICG North American LP, a Delaware limited partnership, holds a 79.64 equity and voting interest in ICGNA.31 ICG North American LPs sole general partner is ICG North American Private Debt GP LP ICG North American GP, a Delaware limited partnership, with a 100 voting interest in ICG North American LP.32 ICG North American LPs limited partners, which New Alpha states are insulated in accordance with the Commissions rules, hold 100 of its equity.33 ICG North American GPs sole general partner is ICG North America Associates LLC, a Delaware limited liability company,34 which is wholly owned by its sole member, ICG FMC, a foreign entity.35 ICG Fund Advisors, LLC ICG Advisors, a Delaware limited liability company, is the investment manager of ICGNAs investment in New Alpha and controls, as investment advisor, ICGNAs 41.4 voting interest in New Alpha.36 In addition, ICG Advisors also acts as the investment manager for, and controls a portion of the interests held by, two additional warrant holders that New Alpha states will not hold an attributable interest in New Alpha or require specific approval. This amounts to ICG Advisors holding an additional voting interest of approximately 1.8 in New Alpha.37 ICG Advisors is wholly owned by Intermediate Capital Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which, in turn, is wholly owned by ICG FMC, a foreign entity.38 Accordingly, ICG FMC, through its indirect ownership of ICGNA and ICG Advisors, holds an indirect 43.2 voting interest in New Alpha that requires specific approval under the Commissions rules.39 29 Id. at 10 47 CFR  1.5000i. 30 Petition at 10 47 CFR  1.5000i. 31 Petition at 10. 32 Id. 33 Id. at 11 Supplement, Attach. C certification of Brian Spenner on behalf of ICG North American LP. New Alpha states that each of the foreign insulated limited partners of ICG North American LP holds less than a 32.11 equity interest in ICG North American LP, and accordingly, no such limited partner requires specific approval. Supplement at 3-5. 34 ICG North American GPs limited partners, which New Alpha states are insulated in accordance with the Commissions rules, hold all of its equity. Petition at 11 Supplement, Attach. D certification of Brian Spenner on behalf of ICG North American GP. Because ICGNAs equity flows through ICG North American LP to its limited partners, neither ICG North American GP nor its limited partners have an indirect equity interest in ICGNA. Petition, Attach.

Id. 39 Id. at 11, n.26. 60 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-18 Finally, ICG PLC, a foreign entity, ultimately controls ICGNA as the sole shareholder of ICG FMC and ICG UK, with a direct interest of 100 equity and voting in those two entities.40 In addition, ICG PLC will also directly hold approximately a 3.3 equity interest and a 3.5 voting interest in New Alpha.41 Accordingly, when combined with the indirect 7.3 equity and 43.2 voting interests that it holds in New Alpha through its ownership of ICG FMC and ICG UK, ICG PLC will hold an approximate 10.6 total equity interest and 46.7 total voting interest in New Alpha.42 BigSur As proposed in the Petition, BigSur, a British Virgin Islands corporation, will hold an approximate 6.3 direct equity interest and a 6.7 direct voting interest in New Alpha.43 New Alpha seeks authorization for BigSur to hold up to 49.99 of New Alphas equity andor voting interests.44 BigSur Partners, LLC BigSur LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, holds a 100 voting interest and 0 equity interest in BigSur.45 BigSur LLC has three U.S. members 1 Gorriti Investments, LLC, a Florida limited liability company 2 BigSur Advisors Corp., a Florida corporation46 and 3 PCP Advisors Corp., a Florida corporation.47 BigSurs equity interests are owned by 15 funds registered in the Bahamas, Netherlands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and New Zealand. According to New Alpha, each fund holds an equity interest of between 3.0 and 12.2 in BigSur, is insulated in accordance with the Commissions broadcast attribution rules, and will hold less than a 1 indirect equity and deemed voting interest in New Alpha.48 Pursuant to Commission practice, the Petition will be referred to relevant Executive Branch agencies for their views on any national security, law enforcement, foreign policy, or trade policy concerns related to the foreign ownership of New Alpha.49 40 Id. at 10. 41 Id. at 11. 42 Id. at 11-12, 16  n.27. 43 Id. at 12. 44 See id. at 16  nn.40-41. 45 Id. at 12. 46 BigSur Advisors Corp. is wholly owned by Ignacio Pakciarz, a U.S. citizen.

All inflation adjustment figures are based on changes in the Gross National Product Price Index GNP-PI published by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA. The chain-type price indexes were obtained from the BEA Table 1.7.4 Price Indexes for Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Product, and Net National Product Line 4 Gross National Product on December 23, 2022.2 Operators filing FCC Form 1240 may make an adjustment based on quarterly figures. The third quarter 2022 inflation factor for operators using FCC Form 1240 is 4.37. The adjustment factor of 4.37 is a measure of the annualized change in prices occurring over the period from July 1, 2022 to September 30, 2022. The inflation adjustment factor is calculated by dividing the GNP-PI for the third quarter of 2022 128.248 by the GNP-PI for the second quarter of 2022 126.885. The result of this calculation is converted from a quarterly change measurement factor to an annual change measurement factor by raising it to the fourth power. We then convert the calculation to an inflation adjustment factor by subtracting one. Operators calculating the Inflation Factor for a True-Up Period that includes some portion of the third quarter of 2022 should enter the inflation factor on the appropriate lines of Worksheet 1 of FCC Form 1240 as 0.0437. Operators using this factor for calculating the Projected Period Inflation Segment of FCC Form 1240 should enter this number on Line C3 January 1996 version, or Line C5 July 1996 version as 1.0437.

FCC 65 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-20 Before the Federal Communications Commission Washington, D.C. 20554 In the Matter of   Amendment of Section 73.622j,  MB Docket No. 22-376 Table of Allotments, Television Broadcast  RM-11934 Stations Norwell, Massachusetts   REPORT AND ORDER Proceeding Terminated Adopted January 9, 2023 Released January 9, 2023 By the Chief, Video Division, Media Bureau 1. The Video Division, Media Bureau Bureau, has before it a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking1 issued in response to a Petition for Rulemaking2 filed by RNN Boston License Co., LLC Petitioner, the licensee of full power television station WWDP, Norwell, Massachusetts Station or WWDP. The Petitioner has requested the substitution of UHF channel 36 for VHF channel 10 in the Table of TV Allotments. The Petitioner filed comments in support of the petition, as required by the Commissions rules rules,3 reaffirming its commitment to apply for channel 36. No other comments were received. 2. We believe the public interest would be served by substituting channel 36 for channel 10 at Norwell, Massachusetts. According to the Petitioner, it has received many complaints from viewers unable to receive a reliable signal on channel 10, a VHF channel.4 The Petitioner further states that the Commission has recognized the deleterious effects manmade noise has on the reception of digital VHF signals, and that the propagation characteristics of these channels allow undesired signals and noise to be receivable at relatively farther distances compared to UHF channels, and nearby electrical devices can cause interference.5 3. An analysis conducted using the Commissions TVStudy software tool indicates that WWDPs proposed channel substitution is predicted to create areas where viewers may lose service. However, we believe any possible harm resulting from the loss of service to some viewers is outweighed by the overall benefit of improving reception to the Stations viewers, including the Stations community 1 Amendment of Section 73.622j, Table of Allotments, Television Stations Norwell, Massachusetts, MB Docket No. 23-376, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, DA 22-1132 rel.

WWDPs channel sharing partner, WMFPTV, Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is also owned by RNN, has similarly received complaints and would benefit from the proposed channel change. NPRM at para. 2. 66 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-20 of license. Moreover, the viewers in the loss area are already well-served by five or more stations and no viewers will lose service from one of the four major networks or any noncommercial educational station.6 4. As proposed, channel 36 can be substituted for channel 10 at Norwell, Massachusetts, in compliance with the principal community coverage requirements of section 73.625a of the rules,7 at coordinates 42 18' 37.0\" N and 71 14' 12.0\" W. In addition, we find that this channel change meets the technical requirements set forth in sections 73.616 and 73.623 of the rules with the following specifications8 City and State Channel Power kW Antenna HAAT m Service Pop. Norwell, Massachusetts 36 1000 318.4 6,509,527 5. We also conclude that good cause exists to make this channel change effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, pursuant to section 553d3 of the Administrative Procedure Act.9 An expedited effective date is necessary in this case to ensure that WWDP can operate with improved service to its viewers as quickly as possible. 6. Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in sections 4i, 5c1, 303g, r, and 307b of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  154i, 155c1, 303g, r, and 307b, and sections 0.61, 0.204b, and 0.283 of the rules, 47 CFR  0.61, 0.204b, and 0.283, IT IS ORDERED, That effective immediately upon the date of publication in the Federal Register, the Table of Allotments, section 73.622j of the rules, 47 CFR  73.622j, IS AMENDED, with respect to the community listed below, to read as follows City and State Channel No. Norwell, Massachusetts 36 7. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, That within 10 days of the effective date of this Order, RNN Boston License Co., LLC shall submit to the Commission a minor change application for a construction permit Form 2100, Schedule A specifying channel 36 in lieu of channel 10. 8. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, That pursuant to section 801a1A of the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C.  801a1A, the Commission SHALL SEND a copy of the Order to Congress and to the Government Accountability Office. 9. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, That should no petitions for reconsideration or petitions for judicial review be timely filed, MB Docket No. 22-376 and RM-11934 SHALL BE TERMINATED and its docket closed. 6 Id. As the Petitioner points out, the Commission is generally most concerned where there is a loss of an area's only network or NCE TV service, or where the loss results in an area becoming less that well-served, i.e., served by fewer than five full-power stations.

INTRODUCTION 1. The Video Division, Media Bureau has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by Blue Ridge Public Television, Inc. Petitioner or Blue Ridge PBS, the licensee of noncommercial educational television PBS member station WBRA-TV WBRA-TV or Station, channel 3, Roanoke, Virginia.1 The Petitioner requests the substitution of channel 13 in place of channel 3 at Roanoke, Virginia in the Table of TV Allotments.2 II. BACKGROUND 2. In support of its channel substitution request, the Petitioner states that apart from WBRA- TV, only one of the seven other full-power television stations in the Roanoke-Lynchburg DMA operates on a VHF channel, and it operates on high-VHF channel 7. The Petitioner asserts that allowing the Station to move to a high-VHF channel would improve viewers access to the Stations PBS and other public television programming by improving reception and resolving low-VHF reception issues.3 According to Petitioner, it has received many complaints from viewers unable to receive a reliable signal on channel 3, with some viewers noting that WBRA-TV is the only Roanoke station they cannot receive reliably over the air.4 Petitioner further states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers, as well as the existence of environmental noise blockages affecting VHF signal strength and reception, which may 1 Petition of Blue Ridge Public Television, Inc. for Rulemaking, LMS File No. 0000203784 filed Nov. 18, 2022 Petition. We note that Petitioner amended its Petition on January 9, 2023 Amended Engineering Statement to include further analysis of the population that may lose predicted service as a result of the proposed channel substitution. Amended Engineering Statement at 1. Noncommercial educational television stations are identified in the Table of TV Allotments by an asterisk to indicate they are reserved for noncommercial educational use. 47 CFR  73.622a. 2 47 CFR  73.622j. 3 Petition at 2-3. WBRA-TV is the only full-power noncommercial educational television station serving the Roanoke-Lynchburg DMA. WBRA-TV currently broadcasts its PBS, public affairs programming, and emergency notifications through WBRA-TVs participation in PBSs Warning, Alert Response Network. The Petitioner asserts that the proposed channel substitution will allow WBRA-TV to better serve the community by substantially improving viewer access to its educational and public affairs programming and emergency notifications. Id. at 2. 4 Id. at 3 and Exhibit 2, Statement of Will Anderson. 72 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-23 vary widely by service area.5 The Engineering Statement provided with the Petition confirms that the proposed channel 13 contour would provide full principal community coverage to Roanoke. An analysis using the Commissions TVStudy software tool, according to Petitioner, indicates that WBRA-TVs move from channel 3 to channel 13 is predicted to create an area where 64,309 persons are predicted to lose service without considering the service from other PBS stations.6 However, when taking into account service from other PBS stations, only 94 persons are predicted to lose PBS service, a number which the Petitioner asserts the Commission has found to be de minimis.7 III. DISCUSSION 3. We believe that the Petitioners channel substitution proposal warrants consideration. Channel 13 can be substituted in place of channel 3 at Roanoke, Virginia, as proposed, in compliance with the principal community coverage requirements of section 73.625a of the Commissions rules rules,8 at coordinates 37 11' 46.0\" N and 80 09' 16.0\" W. We believe any possible harm resulting from the loss of noncommercial educational service to some viewers is outweighed by the overall public interest benefit of improving reception to the Stations viewers, including within the Stations community of license. Although the Petitioners proposal would result in a loss of PBS network programming to some viewers, when taking into account the service provided by noncommercial educational WUNC-TV and WUNL-TV to the WBRA-TV noise limited service contour area, fewer than 500 persons will lose access to PBS network programming, a number the Commission has deemed to be de minimis.9 We also find that this channel change meets the technical requirements set forth in sections 73.616 and 73.623 of the rules.10 Thus, we propose to substitute channel 13 in place of channel 3 for WBRA-TV with the following specifications City and State Channel Power kW Antenna HAAT m Roanoke, Virginia 13 66 630.6 4. Accordingly, we seek comment on the proposed amendment of the Table of TV Allotments, section 73.622j of the rules,11 for the community listed below, to read as follows Channel No. City and State Present Proposed Roanoke, Virginia 3, 27, 30, 34, 36 13, 27, 30, 34, 36 IV.

Petitioners analysis takes into account service being provided by PBS stations WUNC-TV, Chapel Hill, North Carolina WUNC and WUNL-TV, Winston-Salem, North Carolina WUNL. 8 47 CFR  73.625a. 9 See WSET, Inc., 80 FCC 2d 233, 246 1980 finding that loss of service to approximately 550 persons is de minimis. The vast majority of viewers that will no longer receive WBRA-TV are located in North Carolina and continue to be served by WUNL and WUNC, which are both North Carolina PBS affiliates. In fact, many of those impacted viewers may already primarily rely upon WUNL and WUNC for their PBS network and public television programming. 10 47 CFR  73.616, 73.623. 11 47 CFR  73.622j. 73 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-23 proposed allotment is required to file comments even if it only resubmits or incorporates by reference its former pleadings.

In this Order, we consider a complaint alleging that Discount Long Distance, LLC DLD changed Complainants telecommunications service provider without obtaining authorization and verification from Complainant as required by the Commissions rules.1 We find that DLD has responded fully to the Complainants complaint and has taken action to resolve the complaint. 2. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended the Act, prohibits the practice of slamming, the submission or execution of an unauthorized change in a subscribers selection of a provider of telephone exchange service or telephone toll service.2 The Commissions implementing rules require, among other things, that a carrier receive individual subscriber consent before a carrier change may occur.3 Specifically, a carrier must 1 obtain the subscribers written or electronically signed authorization in a format that satisfies our rules 2 obtain confirmation from the subscriber via a toll-free number provided exclusively for the purpose of confirming orders electronically or 3 utilize an appropriately qualified independent third party to verify the order.4 The Commission has also adopted rules to limit the liability of subscribers when an unauthorized carrier change occurs, and to require carriers involved in slamming practices to compensate subscribers whose carriers were changed without authorization.5 3. We received Complainants complaint alleging that DLD had changed Complainants telecommunications service provider without Complainants authorization. Pursuant to our rules, we 1 See Informal Complaint No. 5853364 filed Nov. 9, 2022 see also 47 CFR  64.1100  64.1190. 2 47 U.S.C.  258a. 3 See 47 CFR  64.1120. 4 See id.  64.1120c. Section 64.1130 details the requirements for letter of agency form and content for written or electronically signed authorizations. Id.  64.1130. 5 These rules require the unauthorized carrier to absolve the subscriber where the subscriber has not paid his or her bill. If the subscriber has not already paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the subscriber is absolved of liability for charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier for service provided during the first 30 days after the unauthorized change. See id.  64.1140, 64.1160. Any charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier on the subscriber for service provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the subscriber to the authorized carrier at the rates the subscriber was paying to the authorized carrier at the time of the unauthorized change. Id. Where the subscriber has paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the Commissions rules require that the unauthorized carrier pay 150 percent of those charges to the authorized carrier, and the authorized carrier shall refund or credit to the subscriber 50 percent of all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier. See id.  64.1140, 64.1170. 81 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-26 notified DLD of the complaint.6 Based on the information provided by DLD, it appears that DLD has fully absolved Complainant of all charges assessed by DLD in a manner consistent with the Commissions liability rules.7 We therefore find that the complaint referenced herein has been resolved.8 4. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  258, and sections 0.141, 0.361 and 1.719 of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  0.141, 0.361, 1.719, the complaint filed against Discount Long Distance, LLC IS RESOLVED. 5.

INTRODUCTION 1. With this Public Notice, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau WTB and the Office of Engineering and Technology OET collectively, WTBOET of the Federal Communications Commission Commission or FCC certify that the Spectrum Access System SAS operated by RED Technologies SAS RED has satisfied the Commissions SAS laboratory testing requirements1 and is approved to begin its initial commercial deployment Initial Commercial Deployment or ICD as described in its ICD proposal and consistent with the obligations and conditions detailed in this Public Notice and contained in the ICD Proposals Public Notice.2 WTBOET, in consultation with the Department of Defense DoD and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration NTIA, have reviewed both REDs SAS laboratory testing report and its ICD proposal. II. BACKGROUND 2. In the 2015 Report and Order, the Commission directed WTBOETin consultation with the DoD and NTIAto oversee the review, certification, and approval of SASs in the 3.5 GHz band.3 As required in the 2015 Report and Order, and as further described in the SASESC Proposal Public Notice, all prospective SAS administrators must complete a two-stage review process prior to final 1 Conditionally approved SAS Administrators are permitted to file their laboratory testing reports in GN Docket No. 15-319.

RED chose to file its laboratory testing report with the Commission and requested confidential treatment. See Performance Certification Results for a 3.5 GHz Spectrum Access System Provided for Testing by RED Technologies SAS Final SAS Certification Test Report Submission, GN Docket No. 15-319 filed September 25, 2022 RED SAS Test Report. 2 REDs ICD proposal was filed in GN Docket No. 15-319 consistent with the Commissions instructions and RED requested confidential treatment for its ICD filings. See ICD Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 7394-95, para. 11 RED Technologies SAS Proposal for Spectrum Access System Initial Commercial Deployment, GN Docket No. 15-319, filed November 6, 2022 RED ICD Proposal. 3 See generally Amendment of the Commission's Rules with Regard to Commercial Operations in the 3550-3650 MHz Band, GN Docket No. 12-354, Report and Order and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 30 FCC Rcd 3959, 4067, paras. 369-373 2015 2015 Report and Order and 2015 FNPRM, respectively see also 47 CFR  0.241j, 0.331f. 90 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-30 certification.4 In the first stage, a prospective SAS Administrator must submit a proposal describing how its system will comply with all Commission rules governing the construction, operation, and approval of SASs and perform all core functions described in the 2015 Report and Order.5 The second stage involves SAS testing both in a controlled lab environment and in a real-world setting.6 On May 7, 2021, WTBOET conditionally approved REDs SAS.7 3. As part of the second stage testing process, RED elected to collaborate with the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences ITS, NTIAs research and development arm, in order to complete the laboratory testing requirement.8 ITS completed its laboratory testing and subsequently provided RED with a SAS laboratory test report, which RED submitted for the Commissions review on September 25, 2022.9 4. In order to comply with the field testing requirement, in July 2018, WTBOET sought proposals for short-term, limited geographic commercial deployment.10 Consistent with the requirements set forth in the ICD Proposals Public Notice, RED submitted its ICD proposal on November 6, 2022.11 III. DISCUSSION 5. WTBOET, in coordination with NTIA and DoD, are responsible for assessing and testing each conditionally approved SAS prior to final certification in both laboratory and real-world environments.12 ICD will satisfy the real-world element of the testing process and will allow WTBOET to assess whether a SAS can operate under actual deployment conditions.13 6. WTBOET, in coordination with NTIA and DoD, reviewed REDs laboratory test report and ICD proposal in detail. Based on the information contained in those documents, WTBOET find that REDs laboratory test report satisfies the Commissions requirement to assess and test each SAS in a 4 See Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology Establish Procedure and Deadline for Filing Spectrum Access System SAS Administratorss and Environmental Sensing Capability ESC Operators Applications, GN Docket No. 15-319, Public Notice, 30 FCC Rcd 14170, 14174-77 WTBOET 2015 SASESC Proposal Public Notice. 5 See 2015 Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 4054-55, para. 320 listing SAS core functions see also SASESC Proposal Public Notice, 30 FCC Rcd 14170 Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology Conditionally Approve Three Spectrum Access System Administrators for the 3.5 GHz Band, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 8255WTBOET 2021 Second Wave SAS Conditional Approval Public Notice. 6 See 2015 Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 4067, para. 372 noting that the final compliance testing phase can include a public testing period, testing of protections for incumbent systems, and field trials. On July 27, 2018, WTBOET released a Public Notice that described the procedure and deadline for filing ICD proposals. See ICD Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd 7390. ICD is meant to fulfill the Commissions requirement that applicants conduct a public testing period and field trials prior to final certification. 2015 Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 4067, para. 372. 7 See Second Wave SAS Conditional Approval Public Notice. 8 While lab testing of individual SASs is required before final certification, participation in either the process of verifying and validating the test harness or the subsequent lab testing of an individual SAS with ITS is optional and is not a prerequisite to submitting an ICD proposal or to obtaining final certification. ICD Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 7392, para. 4. 9 See RED SAS Test Report. 10 ICD Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 7390, para. 1. 11 See RED ICD Proposal. 12 See 2015 Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 4067, para. 372. 13 ICD Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 7392, para. 6. 91 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-30 controlled lab environment and that the ICD proposal meets the requirements set forth in the ICD Proposals Public Notice. WTBOET therefore approve REDs SAS for Initial Commercial Deployment subject to the following ongoing compliance obligations  RED must file a notification in GN Docket No. 15-319 stating 1 the beginning date of its ICD period 2 the specific geographic areas covered by ICD deployments 3 whether its SAS is DPA-enabled14 4 whether its SAS will be operating with an approved Environmental Sensing Capability ESC operator during ICD and, if so, which ESC they will be using15 and 5 the expected end date of the ICD reporting period. The notification must also include a primary point of contact for incumbent operators to use to report potential interference issues to its SAS16 and to obtain additional information about ICD operations, if needed. The ICD period may begin once this notification is filed.  ICD must continue for a minimum of 30 consecutive days, consistent with REDs ICD proposal, and they must demonstrate compliance with the Commissions rules and other requirements set forth in the ICD Proposals Public Notice.17 ICDs must involve a variety of testing scenarios featuring multiple Citizen Broadband Radio Service Devices CBSDs18 that result in the generation of data upon which the Commission can reasonably predict that its SAS can reliably operate in compliance with the Commissions rules.19  During ICD, RED must operate a SAS that is functionally consistent with its SAS tested in the laboratory environment. SAS operators may implement software upgrades and patches to address any issues identified during ICD.  RED must comply with all current and future Commission rules, instructions, and procedures. 14 Dynamic Protection Areas DPAs are pre-defined protection areas that extend beyond the coastline or that enclose a protected terrestrial radar facility, which may be activated or deactivated as necessary to protect DoD radar systems.

In the DPA Waiver Order, WTB and OET conditionally waived sections 96.7a, 96.15a2-3, 96.15b2-3, 96.45b, 96.53g, and 96.57d of the Commissions rules to allow 1 DPA-enabled SASs to authorize both Category A and Category B CBSDs in the 3.5 GHz band prior to ESC deployment and certification and 2 DPA-enabled SASs to be certified without being tested for compliance with phase one Exclusion Zone requirements in areas where NTIA has published DPAs. 15 See Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology Announce the Approval and Registration of Environmental Sensing Capability Sensors of Three ESC Operators for the 3.5 GHz Band, GN Docket No, 15-319, Public Notice, DA 19-718 WTBOET July 29, 2019 Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology Announce Approval of Key Bridges Environmental Sensing Capability, GN Docket No. 15-319, DA 22-175 WTBOET February 18, 2022 DPA Waiver Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 4993-94, para.16. 16 See 47 CFR  96.17f. 17 See ICD Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 7392-94, paras. 7-8, 10. 18 CBSDs are fixed stations, or networks of such stations, that operate on a Priority Access or General Authorized Access basis in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. 47 CFR  96.3. 19 ICD Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 7394, para. 10. These scenarios are included in REDs ICD Proposal. See supra note 2. 92 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-30  RED must comply with all instructions issued by WTB and OET pursuant to sections 0.241j and 0.331f of the Commissions rules.20  RED must promptly respond to any Commission, WTB, Enforcement Bureau, or OET requests for additional information.  During ICD, each conditionally approved SAS must promptly deactivate, or make changes in the operational parameters of any CBSD or group of CBSDs, if directed to do so by the Commission, WTB, OET, or Enforcement Bureau. If, during ICD, a SAS is continually shown to cause interference to incumbents, WTBOET may require that SAS to cease all operations until the underlying issues are resolved. 7. In addition, consistent with the ICD Proposals Public Notice and REDs ICD proposal, RED must satisfy the following requirements during ICD  RED must demonstrate that users can register with its SAS, receive authentication, and obtain user IDs during ICD.21  RED must demonstrate how its SAS will communicate with and manage multiple CBSD or Domain Proxy DP products, including the protocols for SAS-CBSD communications for registration, channel grant, and channel release.22 RED must identify all of its commercial partners that will operate during ICD.  RED must demonstrate that a certified professional installer CPI can register CBSDsDPs during ICD and must explain how that professional installation will ensure its SAS can accurately locate devices in compliance with part 96.23  RED must demonstrate that its SAS can access, read, and use data directly from FCC databases during ICD.24  RED must demonstrate its ability to correctly synchronize and exchange information with other SASs and to correctly apply information security procedures and incumbent protection methods during ICD.25  RED must demonstrate the processes that it will use to ensure the correct implementation of all relevant interference protection criteria, including how its SASs over-the-air propagation testing addresses the protection of Fixed Satellite Service earth station sites, federal inland radar test sites, and area-based protections.26 RED should include the results of these protection tests in its ICD Report consistent with its approved final ICD deployment plan. 20 See 47 CFR  0.241j, 0.331f. 21 See, e.g., 47 CFR  96.25c, 96.33, 96.39, 96.57. 22 See, e.g., 47 CFR  96.39, 96.55-59. ICD will not need to cover all test cases performed in ITS lab testing. 23 See 3.5 GHz First Report  Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 4028, para. 220 stressing the importance of accurate CBSD geo-location for coordinating interactions between and among users in the band and for protecting Incumbent Users from harmful interference in compliance with Part 96. WinnForum has developed standards and a program to approve CPIs that successfully complete their training in the relevant Part 96 rules and the associated technical best practices, per the Commissions strong encouragement to multi-stakeholder groups and industry associations in the 3.5 GHz First Report  Order.

RED must also provide a primary point of contact to address questions about SAS operations or information from the Commission, NTIA, and the DoD.  RED must demonstrate real-world application of interference reporting and timely interference mitigation processes, including providing FCC enforcement personnel with access to SAS data upon request.28  Once RED completes its ICD, it must submit an ICD Report to the Commission, according to its approved proposal format and including a demonstration of compliance with these conditions, as well as any outstanding issues identified in REDs lab test report.29 8. These conditions will ensure that RED will comply with the Commissions rules. RED will not receive final certification unless the conditions described in this Public Notice are met, and such certification may be revoked at any time if RED fails to comply with the Commissions rules and guidance on an ongoing basis. IV. NEXT STEPS 9. WTBOET will carefully oversee REDs operations during the ICD period. WTBOET, in coordination with NTIA and the DoD, will review REDs ICD Report and will publicly announce if RED successfully completes ICD and receives final certification to operate a SAS. 10. After RED submits its ICD Report to the Commission, it may continue Initial Commercial Deployment, subject to the conditions described in this Public Notice, during the review period and pending further Commission review. RED may expand operations seven business days after providing notice to the Commission, provided that such notice includes all information required by the ICD Proposals Public Notice. All ICD deployments must comply with all conditions listed in this Public Notice and contained in the ICD Proposals Public Notice.30 11. If RED successfully completes ICD and receives final certification to operate, it will be allowed to make its SAS available for commercial use for the five-year term specified in our rules.31 WTBOET will publicly announce the availability of each SAS, at which time the five-year term will commence. V. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 12. RED must file 1 ICD Reports and any supplements and 2 ICD notifications with the Commission using the Commissions Electronic Comment Filing System.32 See Electronic Filing of 27 ICD Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 7393, para. 7. 28 See, e.g., 47 CFR  96.53, 96.55. 29 ICD Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 7394, para. 10. 30 ICD Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 7392-94, paras. 7-10. 31 See 47 CFR  96.63e. 32 While we will accept proposals electronically, we are not requesting public comment on the reports or notifications at this time. 94 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-30 Documents in Rulemaking Proceedings, 63 FR 24121 1998.

We also dismiss as moot and alternatively deny Etheric Communications LLCs Etheric petition for waiver of the June 7, 2021 deadline requiring each Rural Digital Opportunity Fund long-form applicant to demonstrate, with appropriate documentation, that it has been designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier ETC in each of the geographic areas for which it seeks to be authorized for Auction 904 support.1 1 47 CFR  54.804b5 Etheric Communications, LLC Petition for Waiver of Section 54.804b3 of the Commissions Rules, AU Docket No. 20-34 et al. filed May 12, 2021 Etheric ETC Petition. We note that despite Etherics reference to rule 54.804b3 letter of credit commitment letter in its request, based on the context of the request, WCB has determined the applicant actually seeks waiver of rule 54.804b5 regarding the ETC designation deadline. Generally, the Commissions rules may be waived for good cause shown. 47 CFR  1.3. Waiver of the Commissions rules is appropriate only if both 1 special circumstances warrant a deviation from the general rule and 2 such deviation will serve the public interest. See Northeast Cellular Tel. Co. v. FCC, 897 F.2d 1164, 1166 D.C. Cir. 1990 citing WAIT Radio v. FCC, 418 F.2d 1153, 1157-59 D.C. Cir. 1969, cert. denied, 93 S.Ct. 4611972. On December 15, 2022, the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC issued a decision denying Etherics request for an ETC designation covering its Auction 904 winning bids in the state. California Public Utilities Commission, Application of Etheric Communications, LCC for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to Provide Full Facilities-Based and Resold Competitive Local Exchange and Non-Dominant Interexchange Service and Designation as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier in California, Application 21-01-002, Decision Granting Etheric a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in Order to Provide Full Facilities-Based and Resold Competitive Local Exchange Services and Resold Interexchange Services but Denying Designation as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier, Decision 22-12-026 Dec. 15, 2022. Because Etheric has been unable to obtain an ETC designation covering its winning bid areas in California, Etheric cannot be authorized to receive Auction 904 support in those areas. See Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Auction et al., AU Docket No. 20-34 et al., Order, DA 22-912 WCBOEA Aug. 31, 2022 dismissing California Internet, L.P. dba GeoLinks and Cal.Net, Inc.s petitions for waiver as moot after the CPUC denied their requests for ETC designation. In addition and in the alternative, we deny Etherics petition for waiver on the merits. See Letter from Stephen E. Coran, Counsel to Etheric Communications LLC, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, AU Docket No. 20-34 et al. filed Dec. 21, 2022 claiming that Etheric is considering its options to respond to the CPUC Decision and continued. 101 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-33 For each of the winning bids identified in Attachment A, we have reviewed the long-form application information, including the letters of credit and Bankruptcy Code opinion letters from the long-form applicants legal counsel. Based on the representations and certifications in the relevant long- form application, we authorize and obligate support for the winning bids listed in Attachment A. We will also soon post a state-level summary under the Results tab on the Auction 904 webpage at httpswww.fcc.govauction904round-results. The summary will provide for each long- form applicant included in this Public Notice 1 the total support amount over 10 years and total number of locations that the long-form applicant is being authorized for in each state 2 the total number of locations to which the authorized support recipient must offer the required voice and broadband services for each performance tier and latency in each state and 3 the eligible census blocks included in the winning bids that are being authorized in each state. Upon issuance of this Public Notice, the Universal Service Administrative Company USAC is authorized and directed to take the steps necessary to disburse from the Universal Service Fund the amounts identified in Attachment A to the long-form applicant associated with each study area specified in Attachment A. Payments will be to the account on file for the 498 ID associated with the study area code SAC. The support will be disbursed in 120 monthly payments, which will begin at the end of this month. Below, we provide a summary of the various obligations of authorized Auction 904 support recipients. The list below is not a comprehensive list thus, each support recipient is still responsible for conducting the due diligence required to comply with universal service fund requirements and the Commissions rules. Summary of Obligations and Relevant Dates. All Auction 904 authorized long-form applicants are subject to the following requirements  Annual reporting of location information. Auction 904 support recipients are required to file location information with USAC through the High-Cost Universal Broadband HUBB portal.2 This information includes geolocation data for each qualifying location to which they are offering the requisite service and the technology the Auction 904 support recipient is using to offer the requisite service to the qualifying locations.3 The requisite service is at least one standalone voice plan and one service plan that provides broadband at the relevant performance tier, and latency further proceedings to obtain ETC status in California. Although Etheric filed its petition within the 30-day window for presuming good faith efforts, we find that it would not serve the public interest to delay action on Etherics Rural Digital Opportunity Fund application indefinitely after the CPUC has already denied Etherics ETC petition and while Etheric considers its options for moving forward. Etheric ETC Petition at 2 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund et al., WC Docket No. 19-126 et al., Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd 686, 723, para. 81 2020 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order. Numerous federal and state programs have been established or are being established to promote and fund broadband deployment. By denying Etherics petition, we open the relevant areas covered by Etherics Auction 904 winning bids up to eligibility for future funding programs to the extent they remain unserved, rather than tying up these areas for an indefinite period of time with no indication that Etheric will ultimately obtain an ETC designation from California. Accordingly, we also dismiss Etherics petition for waiver of the deadline to submit audited financial statements as moot. 47 CFR  54.804b4 Etheric Communications, LLC Petition for Waiver of Section 54.804b4 of the Commissions Rules, AU Docket No. 20-34 et al. filed June 4, 2021. Etheric filed its audited financial statements on July 27, 2021. Etheric Communications, LLC, Supplement to Petition for Waiver, AU Docket No. 20-34 et al. filed July 27, 2021. The Bureau will release a public notice in the near future announcing Etherics default in these areas. 2 47 CFR  54.316a8, 54.806a Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 712, para. 56. 3 47 CFR  54.316a8. 102 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-33 requirements at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates offered in urban areas.4 The locations must be in the eligible census blocks covered by the long-form applicants winning bids.5 The Commission has consistently encouraged carriers subject to defined deployment obligations and HUBB reporting obligations to report location data on a rolling basis and has adopted a best practice of filing this information within 30 days after the initial offering of service.6 While reporting on a rolling basis is encouraged, the first deadline for long-form applicants authorized by this Public Notice to submit their location data is March 1, 2024.7 All support recipients must continue to report this information by March 1 in each year thereafter until all build-out requirements are satisfied. For more information about the HUBB portal and reporting location data, visit httpswww.usac.orghigh-costannual- requirementssubmit-data-in-the-hubb.  Service milestones. The service milestones for Auction 904 support recipients authorized by this Public Notice will be as follows8 4 47 CFR  54.805 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 707, para. 42. See also Wireline Competition Bureau and Office of Economics and Analytics Announce Results of 2021 Urban Rate Survey for Fixed Voice and Broadband Services, Posting of Survey Data and Explanatory Notes, and Required Minimum Usage Allowance for Eligible Telecommunications Carriers, WC Docket No. 10-90, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 13667 WCBOEA 2020. We remind all applicants that an eligible telecommunications carrier ETC satisfies its obligation to offer qualifying services by being legally responsible for dealing with customer problems, providing quality of service guarantees, and meeting universal service fund-related requirements. Accordingly, a broadband provider may satisfy its voice obligations by offering voice service through an affiliate or by offering a managed voice solution including VoIP through a third-party vendor, but a provider cannot simply rely on the availability of over-the-top voice options to satisfy this obligation.

A support recipient is deemed to be commercially offering voice andor broadband service to a location if it provides service to the location or could provide it within 10 business days upon request. Id. at 711-12, para. 54. 7 47 CFR  54.316c1. On our own motion we waive the March 1, 2023 deadline for applicants authorized by this Public Notice. We find special circumstances warrant waiver because these applicants are being authorized less than two months prior to the March 1, 2023 HUBB filing date. We also conclude that the waiver will serve the public interest because it will allow USAC sufficient time to make modifications to the HUBB to incorporate the applicants information. Therefore, the first deadline for annual location reporting for these applicants is March 1, 2024, although we continue to encourage reporting on a rolling basis as a best practice. 8 47 CFR  54.802 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 709-12, paras. 45-55. In the 13th Ready to Authorize Public Notice, we found good cause to grant a limited waiver of section 54.802c1 of the Commissions rules to require the applicants with winning bids being authorized by this Public Notice to meet the same service milestones as all Auction 904 support recipients that were authorized in 2022.

Carriers for which the new location count exceeds the CAM locations within their area in each state by more than 35 will have the opportunity to seek additional support or relief from the Commission. Id. 11 Id. Any such support recipient with increased deployment obligations may also seek to have its new location count adjusted to exclude additional locations, beyond the number identified by the CAM, that it determines before the end of year eight are ineligible e.g., are not habitable, unreasonable to deploy to e.g., if it would require a carrier to install new backhaul facilities or other major network upgrades solely to provide broadband to that location, or part of a development newly built after year six for which the cost andor time to deploy before the end of the support term would be unreasonable. Id. at 710-11, para. 50. 12 Id. at 711, para. 51. Carriers for which the new location count is less than 65 of the CAM locations within their area in each state shall have their support amount reduced on a pro rata basis by the number of reduced locations. Id. For example, if a carrier was authorized to receive 3 million per year for 1,000 model locations in a state, but the WCB confirms that there are only 600 actual locations fewer than 650 locations, or 65, WCB would reduce that carriers support to 2,769,231 or 3,000,000  600650. 13 Id. 14 Id. at 711, para. 52. Support recipients are not obligated to offer service to newly built locations that do not request service, or to those with exclusive arrangements with other providers. Id.

Long-form applicants authorized in this Public Notice will be required to file their first annual section 54.313 report by July 1, 2024 and each subsequent year until the year after their support terms have ended.22 Annual reports are filed with USAC. Support recipients must complete the FCC Form 481 on USACs website.23 They must also test and certify compliance with relevant performance requirements in section 54.805 of the Commissions rules on an annual basis.24 WCB, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, and the Office of Engineering and Technology have adopted a uniform framework to measure and report on the performance of ETCs service.25 17 Winning bidders must use Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support to deploy service to locations in only the eligible census blocks, not to the other, ineligible census blocks within a census block group won in the auction. 18 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 712, para. 54. 19 47 CFR  54.320d, 54.806c. 20 Connect America Fund et al., WC Docket No. 10-90 et al., Report and Order, 29 FCC Rcd 15644, 15700, para. 154 2014 December 2014 Connect America Order. 21 See Connect America Fund et al., WC Docket No. 10-90 et al., Order on Reconsideration, 33 FCC Rcd 1380, 1394, para. 35 2018 explaining that it would be difficult for a recipient to meet its burden of demonstrating good cause to grant a waiver of the deployment obligations if it did not plan to build to 100 percent of funded locations at the outset of its support term id. at 1394, para. 33  n.88 explaining that the Commission has cautioned that it does not expect such waiver requests will be granted routinely, and a failure to plan for some contingencies would make it difficult to establish that there is good cause to warrant waiver citing December 2014 Connect America Order, 29 FCC Rcd at 15660, para. 40  n.93. 22 47 CFR  54.313, 54.806a Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 713, para. 57.

The first annual section 54.314 certification is due for the long-form applicants that are being authorized by this Public Notice by October 1, 2024.26 Pursuant to section 54.314 of the Commissions rules, if a support recipient was designated by a state, that state must certify on the support recipients behalf that all federal high-cost support provided . . . within that State was used in the preceding calendar year and will be used in the coming calendar year only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended.27 If a support recipient was designated an ETC by the Federal Communications Commission, it must self-certify by filing a sworn affidavit executed by a corporate officer attesting to the relevant facts.28 Certifications must be filed with both the Commission and USAC. ETCs may submit their certifications to USAC via its online filing system or by sending the appropriate certification sample letter provided on USACs website via email or U.S. mail.29 Certifications must also be submitted to the Commissions Office of the Secretary on or before October 1, 2024.30 The submission should clearly reference WC Docket No. 14-58, ETC Annual Reports and Certifications. All post-designation ETC-related filings must be submitted in good faith and include a certification that, to the best of the ETCs knowledge and belief, the information is complete and accurate.31 In addition, ETCs have an on-going duty to correct or amend information if they have reason to believe, either through their own investigation or upon notice from USAC, that the data are inaccurate, incomplete, or contain errors or anomalies.32 The failure to timely file information may result in penalties in the form of a reduction in support.33 National Security Supply Chain Proceeding. We remind winning bidders that all Auction 904 support recipients will be subject to the Commissions National Security Supply Chain proceeding, including the rule that no universal service support may be used to purchase, obtain, maintain, improve, modify, or otherwise support any equipment or services produced or provided by any company posing a national security threat to the integrity of communications networks or the communications supply chain.34 The prohibition on using universal service funds applies to upgrades and maintenance of 26 47 CFR  54.314, 54.806a. 27 47 CFR  54.314a. 28 47 CFR  54.314b, c2. 29 See Universal Service Administrative Company, Certify Data with 54.314, httpswww.usac.orghigh- costannual-requirementscertify-data-with-54-314. 30 For the reasons articulated in the First Auction 904 Authorization Public Notice, we find there is good cause to waive on our own motion the general high-cost program requirement that the relevant states or the ETCs, if applicable file a section 54.314 certification by October 1, 2023 with respect to the use of Auction 904 support for the applicants authorized in this Public Notice.

Under section 54.320 of the Commissions rules, recipients of high-cost support must retain, for at least ten years, all records necessary to demonstrate to auditors that the support received was consistent with universal service high-cost program rules and to make these documents available upon request to the Commission and any of its Bureaus or Offices and to USAC, and to their respective auditors.38 In addition, all ETCs that receive high-cost support are subject to random compliance audits and other investigations to ensure compliance with program rules and orders, including verification of actual deployment to reported locations.39 Consequences for Non-Compliance. A support recipient is subject to non-compliance measures once it becomes a support recipient if it fails or is unable to meet its minimum coverage requirement or other service requirements, or if it fails to fulfill any other term or condition of Auction 904 support.40 These measures scale with the extent of non-compliance and include additional reporting, withholding of support, and support recovery.41 A defaulting support recipient may also be subject to sanctions, including, but not limited to, potential revocation of ETC designations and suspension or debarment.42 ETC Obligations. All Auction 904 support recipients were required to obtain a high-cost ETC designation prior to being authorized for Auction 904 support, and thus should be familiar with ETC requirements. For example, all high-cost ETCs commit to serving the entire area covered by an ETC designation and must offer Lifeline voice and broadband service throughout such area to qualifying low- income consumers pursuant to the Lifeline program rules.43 While an Auction 904 support recipient was not required to obtain an ETC designation that was limited only to the eligible census blocks covered by its winning bids, it may only use its Auction 904 support to offer the required voice and broadband services to locations in eligible census blocks. If an Auction 904 support recipient has obtained an ETC 35 Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communication Supply Chain through FCC Programs et al., WC Docket No. 18-89 et al., Report and Order et al., 34 FCC Rcd 11423, 11453, para. 77 2019. 36 47 CFR  54.10. 37 Id.  54.11.

Discontinuance of Service andor Relinquishment of Support. It is a violation of Commission rules to receive universal service support if that support is not used to provide, maintain, and upgrade voice andor broadband facilities and services in eligible areas or if the recipient is no longer offering supported services. A carrier that cannot appropriately use universal service support must relinquish its ETC designation pursuant to section 214e4 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended the Communications Act.45 An ETC that was designated by a state commission should follow the state commissions rules to seek relinquishment.46 ETCs designated by the Commission must file a notice of relinquishment in WC Docket No. 09-197, Telecommunications Carriers Eligible for Universal Service Support, using the Commissions Electronic Comment Filing System ECFS.47 WCB will release an order approving the relinquishment if the relinquishing ETC demonstrates that the affected area will continue to be served by at least one ETC.48 The ETC must then send a copy of its relinquishment notice and a copy of the relinquishment order within one week of its release to USAC at hcordersusac.org. A carrier that intends to discontinue service must first obtain authorization to discontinue service pursuant to section 214a of the Communications Act and section 63.71 of the Commissions rules.49 Transfers of Control. ETCs seeking to transfer control of their domestic authorizations to operate pursuant to section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or to engage in the sale of assets under section 214 must first receive approval from the Commission in accordance with sections 63.03 and 63.04 of the Commissions rules governing the procedures for domestic transfer of controlasset applications.50 Transfers of control and assignments of international section 214 authorizations are separately subject to section 63.24 of the Commissions rules.51 Except where the Commission has forborne from the application of section 214, this requirement applies to all transfers of control or asset acquisitions involving ETCs.

Price cap carriers that serve the census blocks where an Auction 904 long-form applicant that is not the incumbent price cap carrier has been authorized to receive support will no longer have a federal high-cost ETC obligation to continue to offer voice service in those census blocks pursuant to the forbearance granted by the Commission. We also note that price cap carriers that 44 For example, some Auction 904 support recipients may have obtained an ETC designation for an entire census block groups that was covered by its winning bids but may only use its Auction 904 support to offer service to locations in the eligible census blocks within the census block groups. 45 47 U.S.C.  214e4. 46 47 CFR  54.205. 47 47 U.S.C.  214e4 Telecommunications Carriers Eligible for Universal Service Support Connect America Fund WC Docket Nos. 09-197 10-90, Order, 36 FCC Rcd 9384, 9393, para. 30 WCB 2021. 48 See, e.g., Telecommunications Carriers Eligible for Universal Service Support, WC Docket No. 09-197, Order, 36 FCC Rcd 9377 WCB 2021 approving T-Mobile USA, Inc.s request on behalf of T-Mobile Northeast LLC to relinquish its ETC designation in Virginia. 49 47 U.S.C.  214a 47 CFR  63.71. 50 47 U.S.C.  214 47 CFR  63.03, 63.04.

WCB will soon update the list of census blocks where incumbent price cap carriers will continue to receive legacy support through the disaggregated legacy high-cost support mechanism by removing the eligible census blocks that are covered by the winning bids in Attachment A.53 In the census blocks removed from the list, incumbent price cap carriers will no longer receive legacy support beginning on the first day of the next month.54 Auction Defaults. On July 26, 2021, the Rural Broadband Auctions Task Force RBATF, WCB, and OEA sent a letter to certain long-form applicants that identified census blocks where concerns had been raised about whether funding those areas would be the best use of our limited universal service funds.55 Applicants were reminded that one of the Commissions core Universal Service Fund policy objectives is to avoid funding deployment in areas that already receive voice and broadband service from an unsubsidized provider, and that the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund was intended to focus on areas wholly unserved by 253 Mbps broadband service.56 The letter recommended that applicants assess whether existing service in the identified areas would affect their ability to meet all program requirements and deployment milestones, and applicants were informed that if they no longer wished to pursue support for a winning bid they should identify those census block groups and provide a brief explanation of their decision to default on their bids.57 In response to the letter, some applicants informed the Commission that they wished to default on census blocks identified by the Commission in the letter while retaining support for other census blocks within the same bid. For these applicants, Attachment A authorizes support only for the areas in which the applicant indicated they intend to meet program requirements.58 52 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 743-45, paras. 133-39. On the first day of the month after an Auction 904 support recipient that is not the incumbent price cap carrier is authorized, the incumbent price cap carrier will be relieved of its federal high-cost ETC obligation to offer voice telephony in those specific census blocks unless it was relieved of that obligation on January 1, 2022. Id. at 745, para. 139. See also December 2014 Connect America Order, 29 FCC Rcd at 1566371, paras. 50-70 47 CFR  54.201d3. We will remove these census blocks as applicable from the list of census blocks where price cap carriers continue to have the federal high- cost ETC obligation to provide voice service. The List of Census Blocks Subject to Federal High-Cost Voice Obligations is available at httpswww.fcc.govencyclopediaprice-cap-resources. 53 Connect America Fund et al., WC Docket No. 10-90, Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd 807, 809-12, paras. 9-16 2019. Incumbent price cap carriers were also given the option of declining legacy support in each state that they serve. See Wireline Competition Bureau Announces Universal Service Support Amounts Offered to Price Cap Carriers and Fixed Competitive Eligible Telecommunications Carriers after Authorization of Connect America Phase II Auction Support, Public Notice, 34 FCC Rcd 1296 WCB 2019. 54 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 738-40 stating that price cap carriers will no longer receive legacy support for the census blocks where Auction 904 support is authorized beginning on the first day of the month after the Auction 904 support is authorized for those census blocks. 55 See Letters to Long-Form Applicants about Identified Census Blocks, httpswww.fcc.govauction904releases Identified Census Blocks Letter. 56 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 689, para. 5. 57 See 47 CFR  54.805 RDOF public interest obligations see generally, 47 U.S.C.  254e USF support must be used for its intended purpose. 58 For the reasons articulated in the Fourth RDOF Authorization Public Notice regarding defaults on letter-identified census blocks, we find good cause to waive the requirement that a default encompass the entire winning bid, and we authorize support on a per-census-block basis for the census blocks in which applicants listed in Attachment A are eligible.

INTRODUCTION The Federal Communications Commissions Commissions biennial commercial and noncommercial broadcast ownership reporting formsFCC Form 323 and Form 323-E, respectivelyare designed to obtain detailed ownership information from the broadcast industry. This report, which presents data on ownership interests in commercial and noncommercial broadcast stations as of October 1, 2021 by gender, race, and ethnicity,1 is the latest in a series of such publicly released tabulations. On November 14, 2012, the Media Bureau released the first electronic analysis of commercial broadcast ownership data submitted pursuant to the revised biennial reporting requirements for 2009 and 2011.2 Subsequent reports contained analyses of the commercial broadcast ownership data submitted during the 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019 filing cycles.3 Accordingly, this report presents a tabulation of the seventh data collection using the current version of Form 323 and the third data collection using the current version of Form 323-E.4 Like the prior reports, the data contained in these reports are snapshots of the status of minority and female ownership in the broadcast industry taken every two years. The collection, tabulation, and release of these data are useful to the public, Congress, and the Commission because they provide an insight into the ownership of broadcast stations, both commercial and noncommercial, over time, that could be relevant to the Commissions policymaking as well as used by interested parties.5 This report covers commercial and noncommercial stations in five broadcast servicesfull power television, Class A television, low power television, AM radio, and FM radio. As of October 1, 2021, 1 The Media Bureaus previous Report presented data on commercial broadcast stations as reported in the 2019 filing cycle.

See, e.g., Promoting Diversification of Ownership in the Broadcasting Services et al., Report and Order, Second Report and Order, and Order on Reconsideration, 31 FCC Rcd 398, 400-01, paras. 4-6 2016 2016 323 and 323-E Order. In 2016, the Commission revised the ownership reporting form for noncommercial broadcast stations, Form 323-E, to align the reporting requirements for noncommercial stations more closely with those for commercial stations. See id. at 420-28, paras. 43-55 see also Promoting Diversification of Ownership in the Broadcasting Services et al., Order on Reconsideration, 32 FCC Rcd 3440 2017 2017 323-E Order on Reconsideration further revising noncommercial filing requirements. Pursuant to the 2016 323 and 323-E Order, noncommercial stations are now required to submit biennial ownership reports on the same schedule applicable to commercial stations, including the October 1 as of date. See 2016 323 and 323-E Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 432-33, paras. 64-67. Such filings were submitted by noncommercial licensees for the first time as part of the 2017 biennial filing cycle. See id. at 429, 432, paras. 58, 66 Promoting Diversification of Ownership in the Broadcasting Services, Order, 31 FCC Rcd 13263, 13263-64, paras. 1-2 MB 2016 suspending rolling filing deadlines for noncommercial stations and instead requiring all such stations to file on or before December 1, 2017. 5 The information in this report meets the Commissions information quality guidelines. See Implementation of Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility and Integrity of Information Pursuant to Section 515 of Public Law No. 105-554, Information Quality Guidelines, 17 FCC Rcd 19890 2002. 203 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-35 there were approximately 1,760 licensed full power television stations, 380 licensed Class A television stations, 1,740 licensed low power television stations, 4,520 licensed AM radio stations, and 10,890 licensed FM radio stations. This report focuses on two aspects of the recently collected ownership dataattributable ownership interests and majority ownership interestsusing the lenses of gender, race, and ethnicity.6 First, the report analyzes the reported information concerning attributable interest holders, consistent with the Commissions broadcast ownership attribution rules.7 Those rules represent the Commissions best judgment concerning when an interest is sufficient to confer on the owner a potential degree of influence over a licensee that should be cognizable for purposes of applying the Commissions broadcast ownership rules. As a general matter, the Commission for decades has deemed officers and directors of licensee entities, as well as holders of 5 or more voting interests, to be attributable owners.8 Within this rubric, the report considers the gender, race, and ethnicity of attributable ownership interest holders. In graphs and tables reporting attributable ownership interests, the gender, race, and ethnicity categories are not mutually exclusive. Each station may appear in multiple gender, race, and ethnicity categories because many stations have attributable interest holders who belong to different gender, racial, or ethnic groups. For example, a station with both male and female attributable interest holders would be counted in both the male and female categories. Second, the report adapts a measure the Commission often employs in ownership analyses generally, the majority ownership interest. In those other contexts, the Commission pays heed to whether a stations attributable ownership ranks include a party that holds more than 50 of a stations voting interests, because of the degree of influence that entity likely would have over station operations and decision- making.9 Along the same lines, this report considers whether a person or group of people sharing the same gender, race or ethnicity characteristics collectively hold more than 50 of the voting interests in a licensee. For example , a stations majority ownership interest in gender would be female if a single woman or a group of women held more than 50 of the voting interests in the licensee. A stations majority interest in race and ethnicity is determined in the same way. Notably, some stations do not have a discernable majority interest on the basis of gender, race, or ethnicity.10 Such stations are classified as having No Majority Interest. 6 Following government standards, the report employs two gender classifications male and female, six racial classifications American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Two or more races, and White, and two ethnic classifications HispanicLatino and not HispanicLatino. The gender, race, and ethnicity categories identified in Forms 323 and 323-E follow the guidance provided by the Office of Management and Budget. See Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity, Notice of Decision, 62 Fed. Reg. 58,782 Oct. 30, 1997. See Appendix A for the definitions of each racial and ethnic classification. 7 See the notes to 47 CFR  73.3555. 8 For details, see Section II.A. 9 See, e.g., Instructions for Ownership Report for Commercial Broadcast Stations, FCC Form 323, OMB Approval No. 3060-0010, at 6 httpswww.fcc.govsitesdefaultfiles323.pdf FCC Sept. 2022 most recent approval of decades-old form. 10 The next section presents more detail about the two measures of ownership used in this report, attributable ownership interest and majority ownership interest. In addition, the following section discusses the reasons why a station may have no discernable majority ownership interest in one of the demographic categories. 204 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-35 Overview of 2021 Broadcast Station Ownership Data The shares of stations held by the various classifications reported below are calculated on the basis of the number of stations filing usable data, not on the basis of the total number of licensed stations.11 Figure 1 below summarizes the majority ownership interest of all commercial broadcast stations in gender, race, and ethnicity. Women held a majority ownership interest in 9 of commercial broadcast stations, while men held a majority ownership interest in 61 of commercial broadcast stations. White persons held a majority ownership interest in 73 of commercial broadcast stations, while persons belonging to racial minority groups held a majority ownership interest in 4 of commercial broadcast stations. Finally, HispanicLatino persons held a majority ownership interest in 6 of commercial broadcast stations while non-HispanicLatino persons held a majority ownership interest in 70 of commercial broadcast stations. Figure 2 below summarizes the majority ownership interest of all noncommercial broadcast stations by gender, race, and ethnicity. Women held a majority ownership interest in 15 of noncommercial broadcast stations, while men held a majority ownership interest in 77 of noncommercial broadcast stations. White persons held a majority ownership interest in 93 of noncommercial broadcast stations, while persons belonging to racial minority groups held a majority ownership interest in 3 of noncommercial broadcast stations. Finally, HispanicLatino persons held a majority ownership interest in 11 Information regarding the usable reports for each respective service is contained in the relevant tables below. Recognizing that there are certain limited instances where a non-profit entity holds a commercial licenseand therefore parts of Form 323 may be inapplicable to the entitys structurethe Commission permits such an entity to file Form 323-E instead of Form 323. See 2016 323 and 323-E Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 423-24, para. 48 n.175. All stations that filed Form 323-E are treated as noncommercial for purposes of this report. 205 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-35 3 of noncommercial broadcast stations, while non-HispanicLatino persons held a majority ownership interest in 94 of noncommercial broadcast stations. For reference, we also present demographic information for the U.S. population. In 2021, the U.S. population was almost evenly split between men and women. About 80 of the U.S. population identified as not HispanicLatino while about 20 identified as HispanicLatino. By race, 61 of the U.S. population identified as White, about 12 identified as Black or African American, and about 6 identified as Asian. About 1 of the U.S. population identified as American Indian or Alaska Native and a smaller share identified as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. About 13 of the U.S. population identified as belonging to two or more racial groups and about 7 belonged to some other racial group. In total, just over 40 of the U.S. population identified as belonging to a racial or ethnic minority group whereas the share of the U.S. population identifying as White, not HispanicLatino was about 60.12 The remainder of the report contains 1 a discussion of the ownership measures used in this report to summarize station ownership filings 2 a comparison of certain 2021 and 2019 data for commercial and noncommercial broadcast stationsfull power television, Class A television, low-power television LPTV, AM radio, and FM radio and 3 more detailed information about station ownership in the 12 U.S. Census Bureau, 2021 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates, httpsdata.census.govtable?g0100000UStidACSDP1Y2021.DP05 last visited Nov. 23, 2022. 206 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-35 attached tables and appendices, as well as in accompanying spreadsheets released in conjunction with this report.13 II. MEASURES OF OWNERSHIP A. Attributable Ownership Interest As noted above, a stations ownership report must identify all of its attributable interest holders.14 The attribution rules represent the Commissions best judgment concerning when an interest is sufficient to confer on the owner a potential degree of influence over a licensee that should be cognizable for purposes of applying the Commissions broadcast ownership rules. With regard to corporations, individuals holding voting stock interests in a broadcast licensee of 5 or greater are considered attributable interest holders.15 Further, individuals holding particular positions within a broadcast licensee entity also are attributable interest holders, regardless of their shares of voting stock. For example, officers and directors of broadcast licensee entities are attributable based on their corporate positions, as are members of limited liability companies and partners in a limited or general partnership, respectively.16 Consistent with the Commissions rules, these individuals are deemed to have a role in the ownership and control of the broadcast licensee. Further, these individuals may exercise control of a licensee in cases where no single individual holds a majority of the voting interests in that licensee and therefore are more likely to exercise such control where no attributable voting interests are identified. This, however, cannot be inferred from the Form 323323-E data alone, as the specific facts of each case would be required to determine actual control. In graphs and tables reporting attributable ownership interests, the gender, race, and ethnicity categories are not mutually exclusive. Each station may appear in multiple gender, race, and ethnicity categories because many stations have attributable interest holders who belong to different gender, racial, or ethnic groups. For example, a station with both male and female attributable interest holders would be counted in both the male and female categories. B. Majority Ownership Interest The report also uses the concept of majority ownership interest to summarize station ownership. As stated above, a station has a majority ownership interest in gender, race, or ethnicity if a single individual or a group of individuals belonging to the same gender, racial, or ethnic group hold more than 50 of the voting interests in the licensee. For example, if a single woman or a group of women hold more than 50 of voting interests in a licensee, the stations majority ownership interest in gender is female. The majority ownership interests in race and ethnicity are determined in the same way. If there is no gender, racial, or ethnic group whose members hold more than 50 of voting interests, the station is classified as having No Majority Interest. Our classification of a licensee in this report as having No Majority Interest does not necessarily mean that no classification of persons by gender, race, or ethnicity has a majority interest in the station, only that these facts could not be determined from the 13 The accompanying spreadsheets present ownership characteristics for each broadcast station, identified by its Facility ID number. These spreadsheets also provide the current call sign for each broadcast station. The spreadsheets are available at httpswww.fcc.govbiennial-forms-323-and-323-e-broadcast-ownership-data-and- reports. 14 See the notes to 47 CFR  73.3555. 15 Ownership of less than 5 of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation, however, is not attributable. See 47 CFR  73.3555, Note 2a. 16 See 47 CFR  73.3555, Note 2g. The relevant question on Form 323323-E identifies the following additional categories of positional interests General Partner Limited Partner LCLLCPLLC MemberOwnerStockholder Attributable Creditor and Attributable Investor. The question also provides an Other option for users to specify an attribution category not contained in our list. All stations reporting persons identified by any one of these categories are included in Tables 1 and 2. 207 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-35 reported Form 323323-E data in the absence of additional information. Stations may be classified as having no majority interest because some of a licensees voting stock are not reported on Form 323 or Form 323-E. This occurs because the Commission does not attribute ownership of a licensee corporation to anyone who holds less than 5 of the outstanding voting interest of that corporation.17 Particularly where the licensee is a public, widely held entity, it is common for large portions of a licensees voting stock not to be reported on Form 323323-E. In some cases, no attributable voting stock may be reported. C. Caveats and Clarifications This report provides detailed information by gender, race, and ethnicity about the ownership of commercial and noncommercial television, radio, Class A television, and LPTV stations. As with previous reports, however, this report tallies and presents the data as provided to the Commission by filers. Therefore, its results ultimately rely on the accuracy and completeness of those filings. Users of the information in this report should also bear in mind that while control of a licensee in the usual parlance of the Commissions cases, rules, and procedures refers to actual control of the licensee, either in terms of de jure or de facto control by an identifiable individual or group, the tabulation of interests in this report focuses on individuals or groups that share self-identified traits, irrespective of whether the person or group has de jure or de facto control. Because the Commission reports interests here that are held collectively by certain classes of individuals who may have no connection with one another beyond their shared classification by gender, race, or ethnicity, the fact that a particular class of individuals may have a majority of the voting stock, membership, or partnership interests in a licensee does not necessarily indicate actual control of the licensee by that class of individuals. Rather, absent a single majority interest holder, control of these stations would be determined on a de facto basis, which requires access to facts not reported on Form 323. Accordingly, this report refers to these collective interests as majority interests, rather than controlling interests. Similarly, where no majority interest is reported, a de facto control analysis would be required to determine actual control. However, when a single individual, of whatever classification, holds a majority voting interest in a licensee, this would indicate de jure control by that individual and is considered a controlling interest. Some parties have suggested that, due to dissimilarities between the governance of commercial and noncommercial stations, the concept of ownership for noncommercial stations may be less obvious than in the context of commercial stations.18 Nonetheless, for both Form 323 commercial and Form 323-E noncommercial purposes, the concept of ownership relies on the attribution standards set forth in Section 73.3555 of the Commissions rules, which generally do not depend on equity interests but instead seek to identify those interests . . . that confer . . . a degree of influence or control such that the holders have a realistic potential to affect the programming decisions of licensees or other core operating functions.19 The Commissions attribution standards apply to both commercial and noncommercial stations, because the Commission has concluded that individuals and entities captured by these standards have the potential to exert influence over the licensee, regardless of whether the station at issue is commercial or noncommercial.20 Officers and directors therefore are attributable owners of the noncommercial licensees they serve, and such individuals historically have been reported as attributable interest holders on both commercial and noncommercial broadcast ownership reports.21 17 See 47 CFR  73.3555, Note 2a. 18 2016 323 and 323-E Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 422, para. 46. 19 Id. at 422-23, para. 47 quoting Review of the Commissions Regulations Governing Attribution of Broadcast and CableMDS Interests, Report and Order, 14 FCC Rcd 12559, 12560, para. 1 1999. 20 Id. at 423-24, para. 48. 21 Id. at 422-23, paras. 47 Officers and directors of NCE stations already are defined as attributable interest holders in NCE stations and they already are reported on Form 323-E.. 208 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-35 III. SUMMARY OF RESULTS This section presents a summary of FCC Form 323 and Form 323-E data by category of ownership attributable ownership interest and majority ownership interest and by gender, race, and ethnicity. 22 Results are reported by service. For clarity and to provide context, we present 2021 figures against the backdrop of 2019 figures. The following summary uses data from the 2021 Form 323 and Form 323-E biennial reports, representing information current as of October 1, 2021, and the 2019 Form 323 and Form 323-E biennial reports, representing information current as of October 1, 2019. The share of stations held by individuals in the various classifications reported below are calculated on the basis of the number of stations filing usable data, not on the basis of the total number of licensed stations. Stations that did not file an ownership report are not included in the majority ownership interest or the attributable ownership interest calculations. In addition, some stations submitted one or more ownership reports, but their filings were incomplete. While these stations are not included in the majority ownership interest calculations, attributable interest holders disclosed on reports for these stations are included in the attributable ownership interest calculations. The first figure for each service reports the share of stations with at least one attributable interest holder who belongs to each gender, race, or ethnicity classification. Each station may appear in more than one gender, race, or ethnicity classification. The second figure for each service reports the share of stations for which an individual or a group of individuals of the same gender, race, or ethnicity hold, either individually or collectively, a majority of the voting interests in the licensee, that is, their voting interests exceed 50. When a station is identified as having no majority interest, that does not necessarily mean that no particular classification of persons has a majority interest in the station, only that this cannot be determined from the reported Form 323 or Form 323-E data as submitted. In the second figure, each station appears in only one gender, race, and ethnicity classification. Joint femalemale is defined as a situation in which the aggregate votes of the female attributable owners and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owners both separately exceed 50 e.g., a station where a female and a male each own 100 of the station as joint tenants. The information summarized graphically is provided in Appendix B in a series of tables presenting the sources of ownership attribution. Detailed information, including market size data, is contained in the tables in Appendix B and in the accompanying Excel spreadsheets released in conjunction with this report. 22 Previous versions of this report, including the report presenting data for the 2019 filing cycle, can be found at httpswww.fcc.govbiennial-forms-323-and-323-e-broadcast-ownership-data-and-reports. We note that a number of possible factors could account for shifts or changes in data from 2019 to 2021, including intervening station transfers or assignments other changes in a licensees ownership between 2019 and 2021 differences between the actual entities that filed reports in the 2019 window versus the 2021 window diversification of ownership within a licensee or respondent that results in fewer findings of a majority control group consisting primarily of one gender, racial, or ethnic group or transfers or assignments of licenses from entities with defined control groups to entities with no identifiable control group, among others. 209 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-35 A.

The Media Bureau compiled the 2021 biennial ownership filings using both algorithmic analysis and manual adjustments to improve the accuracy of the reported ownership status and trends. The public can search and retrieve ownership reports submitted in LMS based on multiple criteria, including call sign, facility ID number, service, station location city and state, andor FCC Registration Number FRN, among other things.2 For each report listed, the LMS search results screen indicates whether that report was submitted for a licenseepermittee or for a parent entity. This allows users to quickly identify filings that contain relevant information.3 In addition, the data contained in each Form 323 and 323-E ownership report are publicly available and may be downloaded from the Commissions website then aggregated, cross-referenced, and searched electronically by interested parties.4 Insufficient and Missing Data Insufficient data to identify For stations classified as insufficient data, the computer code was unable to process the voting interests submitted to the Commission in these stations biennial filings. For the first four reports, stations classified as insufficient data for purposes of determining voting interests were also classified as insufficient data for counting attributable individuals. Subsequent reports, including the current report, include individuals with attributable interests for all stations that submitted one or more 323323-E filings, even if filings for those stations were incomplete. This approach allows us to include attributable interest holders for more stations but, for stations with incomplete filings, the set of attributable interest holders reported may be incomplete. Not filed This category includes situations where a the stations licensee did not file a biennial 323 or 323-E form, or b the Commissions LMS was unable to accept the licensees filing as a result of the licensee failing to file a fee, or c the licensees filing could not be processed at all by the computer code. Ethnicity and Race Definitions Ethnicity Definition  Hispanic or Latino A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish Culture or origin, regardless of race.5 1 See 2016 323 and 323-E Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 438 n.279.

Commission staff manually examined a number of filings, based on the data contained in the Form 323 submissions, together with other available information such as communications with licensees or their counsel, as well as analysis of additional reports and applications filed by stations, and reassigned the stations to the appropriate category for the purposes of this report. 6 OMB Standards Notice, 62 Fed. Reg. at 58789. 221 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-35 APPENDIX B Tables In this Appendix, we report four tables for each of the ten categories of broadcast stations A Full Power Commercial Television, B Class A Television, C Low Power Television, D Commercial AM Radio, E Commercial FM Radio, F Full Power Noncommercial Television, G Class A Noncommercial Television, H Low Power Noncommercial Television, I Noncommercial AM Radio, and J Noncommercial FM Radio. Tables 1 and 2 summarize station ownership by the gender, race, and ethnicity of stations attributable interest holders. Tables 3 and 4 report the majority ownership interest of all stations by gender, race, and ethnicity. Each table reports measures nationally and by market size. The share of stations held by individuals in the various classifications reported below are calculated on the basis of the number of stations filing usable data, not on the basis of the total number of licensed stations. Stations that did not file an ownership report are classified as Not Filed in all tables and are not included in the majority ownership interest or the attributable ownership interest calculations. In addition, some stations submitted one or more ownership reports, but their filings were incomplete. These stations are classified as insufficient data in Tables 3 and 4, and while these stations are not included in the majority ownership interest calculations, attributable interest holders disclosed on reports for these stations are included in the attributable ownership interest calculations. Table 1 reports the number and share of stations with at least one attributable interest holder who belongs to each gender, race, or ethnicity classification. This table also reports the number and share of stations that have at least one attributable interest holder who belongs to a racial andor ethnic minority group. Each station may appear in more than one gender, race, and ethnicity classification in this table. The gender, race, and ethnicity categories are not mutually exclusive in this table. Table 2 reports the number and share of stations that have at least one attributable interest holder who belongs to each race and gender e.g., BlackAfrican American male, Asian female, etc. and ethnicity and gender e.g., HispanicLatino female, not HispanicLatino male, etc. classification. The table also reports the number and share of stations that have at least one attributable interest holder who belongs to a racial andor ethnic minority group and gender classification i.e., racial andor ethnic minority male and racial andor ethnic minority female. Each station may appear in more than one race and gender, ethnicity and gender, and racialethnic minority and gender classification in this table. The race and gender, ethnicity and gender, and racialethnic minority and gender categories are not mutually exclusive in this table. Tables 1 and 2 report the presence of attributable interest holders in a licensee who belong to different gender, race, and ethnicity classifications. These tables, however, do not offer information on the voting interests held by members of each group. In addition, a station must only have one attributable interest holder in a gender, race, or ethnicity classification to be counted in that category. For instance, a station with ten attributable interest holders who are white and one attributable interest holder who is Asian would be classified in the same way as a station with ten attributable interest holders who are Asian and one attributable interest holder who is white. Both stations would be classified as having at least one attributable interest holder who is Asian and at least one attributable interest holder who is white. Table 3 reports the number and share of stations for which an individual or a group of individuals of the same gender, race, or ethnicity hold, either individually or collectively, a majority of the voting interests in the licensee that is, their voting interests exceed 50. The table also reports the number and share of stations for which members of a racial or ethnic minority group hold a majority of voting interests in the licensee. When a station is identified as having no majority interest, that does not necessarily mean that no particular classification of persons has a majority interest in the station, only that this cannot be determined from the reported Form 323 or Form 323-E data as submitted. Each station appears in only one gender, race, and ethnicity classification in this table. The gender, race, and ethnicity categories are mutually exclusive in this table. 222 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-35 Joint femalemale is defined as a situation in which the aggregate votes of the female attributable owners and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owners both separately exceed 50. For example, a station where a woman and a man each own 100 of the station as joint tenants would be classified as having a joint femalemale majority interest in gender. Table 4 reports the number and share of stations by majority ownership interest in race and gender and ethnicity and gender categories. The table also reports the number and share of stations with a majority interest held by a racial andor ethnic minority group and gender classification i.e., racial andor ethnic minority male, racial andor ethnic minority female, racial andor ethnic minority combination. Each station appears in only one race and gender, ethnicity and gender, and racialethnic minority and gender classification in this table. The race and gender, ethnicity and gender, and racialethnic minority and gender categories are mutually exclusive in this table. Combination includes situations in which the aggregate votes of the female attributable owners and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owners of the same race or ethnicity both separately exceed 50. For example, a station in which a woman and man, both HispanicLatino, each own 100 as joint tenants would be classified as HispanicLatino combination. Combination also includes situations in which the aggregate votes of neither gender exceed 50, but the aggregate votes of the female attributable owners and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owners of the same ethnicity or race together exceed 50. For example, a station in which Asian women hold 40 of the vote and Asian men hold 40 of the vote would be classified as Asian combination. Some stations that are classified as combination stations are classified as having no majority interest in gender in Table 3. For example, a station in which HispanicLatino women hold 45 of the vote, HispanicLatino men hold 45 of the vote, and 10 of the vote is unattributed would be classified as HispanicLatino combination and no majority interest in gender. However, some combination stations have a majority interest in gender. For example, a station in which HispanicLatino women hold 45 of the vote, HispanicLatino men hold 45 of the vote, and not HispanicLatino women hold 10 of the vote would be classified as HispanicLatino combination in Table 4 but female majority interest in gender in Table 3. 223 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-35 TABLE A 1 - 4 2021 Full Power Commercial Television 224 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-35 Table A1 Attributable Ownership Interest by Gender, Race, and Ethnicity Stations with One or More Attributable Persons Full Power Commercial Television Stations  2021 No. of Stations and  of Total Nielsen Nielsen DMA Nielsen Nationally DMA 1-50 51-100 DMA 101 No.  No.  No.  No.  Gender Female 1,227 89.9 494 91.3 336 94.9 397 84.5 Male 1,349 98.8 540 99.8 351 99.2 458 97.4 Race Asian 148 10.8 120 22.2 22 6.2 6 1.3 BlackAfrican American 783 57.4 314 58.0 229 64.7 240 51.1 Native HawaiianPacific Islander 32 2.3 29 5.4 1 0.3 2 0.4 American IndianAlaska Native 180 13.2 118 21.8 39 11.0 23 4.9 Two or More Races 301 22.1 92 17.0 85 24.0 124 26.4 White 1,350 98.9 536 99.1 350 98.9 464 98.7 Ethnicity HispanicLatino 766 56.1 354 65.4 185 52.3 227 48.3 Not HispanicLatino 1,337 97.9 536 99.1 354 100.0 447 95.1 Any racial or ethnic minority 1,023 74.9 446 82.4 269 76.0 308 65.5 Total stations 1,365 100 541 100 354 100 470 100 Stations not filed 0 --- 0 --- 0 --- 0 --- All licensed stations 1,365 --- 541 --- 354 --- 470 --- Notes The table reports the number and share of stations that have at least one person, by gender, race, or ethnicity, with an attributable interest, nationally and by DMA rank.

Youngers Youngers, and a related responsive pleading.2 For the reasons set forth below, we deny the Objection, deny the May 19, 2022, amendment to the SGC Application, and grant the SGC Application as amended by the May 16, 2022, amendment. Background. SGC filed the SGC Application during the 2021 NCE FM Filing Window.3 The Media Bureau Bureau identified the SGC Application as part of MX Group 78.4 This group consisted of four mutually exclusive MX applications the SGC Application, the application of Fairmont Area 1 Application File No. 0000167515 SGC Application. As discussed below, SGC filed two amendments to the Application one on May 16, 2022, and one on May 19, 2022. 2 Pleading File No. 0000193345 filed June 14, 2022 Objection. SGC filed an Opposition to the Objection. Pleading File No. 0000197019 filed Aug. 4, 2022 Opposition.

On May 19, 2022, SGC filed another minor technical amendment to its SGC Application, which sought authorization to increase the effective radiated power from 6 kW to 22 kW.11 This amendment was only possible because the Bureau had dismissed the VCY Application. On June 14, 2022, Youngers filed his Objection, claiming that SGC should not have been permitted to file its May 16 or May 19 amendments because no amendments on the original NCE applications were allowed after the settlement period which were before the Fair Distribution Order.12 Youngers also argues that the Bureau should not accept amendments after the 30-day petition to deny period runs because only one application may be granted from each MX group, and if applications . . . can be amended after the selection process, then there is less pressure to make any settlements in the settlement period.13 In the Opposition, SGC argues that section 73.7003d of the Commissions rules Rules permits applications to be amended at any time, and that the Commission routinely accepts minor technical amendments after the settlement period has run.14 Discussion. Pursuant to section 309d of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended Act,15 petitions to deny and informal objections must provide properly supported allegations of fact that, if true, 5 Application File No. 0000167071 FACR Application. 6 Application File No. 0000167877 VCY Application. 7 Application File No. 0000167166 Hope Application. 8 Threshold Fair Distribution Analysis of 16 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 22-356 MB Apr. 4, 2022 Fair Distribution Order. 9 Id. at 11, para. 38. 10 SGC Application, Amendment at Attach.

Under the one-grant policy, the Commission only grants one application or tied applications per mutually exclusive group.17 In our most recent review of our NCE processing rules, the Commission explicitly upheld the one-grant policy and rejected requests to allow for secondary grants after selection of a tentative selectee.18 However, nothing in the Rules, the MX Groups Public Notice, nor our NCE FM processing procedures19 prohibits an applicant from filing an amendment to eliminate its mutual exclusivities before, or after, the Bureau or the Commission conducts its comparative analysis. Specifically, the Commission held that it would continue to permit additional grants from an MX group if an applicantby technical amendment, the voluntary dismissal of competing applications, andor a valid settlement agreementeliminates all conflicts to other applications in the group.20 Here, SGCs May 16 amendment fully resolved all of its mutually exclusivities with all of the other applicants in MX Group 78 and thus completely removed the application from MX Group 78. This amendment was not dependent on the Commission dismissing applications from the MX group and, therefore, does not violate our one-grant policy. In contrast, SGCs subsequent May 19 technical amendment to its engineering proposal violates our one-grant policy.21 Unlike the May 16 amendment, SGCs May 19 amendment is dependent on the Commission involuntarily dismissing the VCY Application, which is the type of secondary grant the Commission previously rejected.22 The Commission has affirmed the dismissal of applications that became singletons based solely on the involuntary dismissal of other conflicting applications in the MX group.23. We have also recently rejected similar efforts by applicants that rely on the involuntary 16 See, e.g., WWOR-TV, Inc., Memorandum Opinion and Order, 6 FCC Rcd 193, 197 n.10 1990, aff'd sub nom.

The rule only applies to settlements, not to unilateral amendments. See 47 CFR  73.7003d. 22 SGCs May 16 amendment was not premised on the involuntary dismissal of other applications in the MX group and eliminated all conflicts with the other applications in the MX group. See, e.g., NCE October 2007 Window MX Group Number 363, Letter Order, 25 FCC Rcd 9060 MB 2010 differentiating between a voluntary withdrawal that facilitated a settlement agreement and our one selectee per NCE MX group policy. 282 dismissal of mutually exclusive applications to circumvent the one-grant policy.24 Accordingly, we deny the May 19 amendment, deny the Objection, and grant the SGC Application, as amended on May 16, 2022.25 ConclusionAction.

PCMI, an Ohio private equity firm controlled by United States citizens.10 Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, the Convertible Note will convert to equity in IdeaTek, and Daniel P. Friesens interest will be reduced from 53.21 to 24.46, thereby effectuating a transfer of control of IdeaTek.11 Applicants state that the PCMI entities and their affiliates do not provide any telecommunications services.12 Applicants assert that a grant of the Application would serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity, and that PCMIs capital investment will enhance IdeaTeks ability to meet and accelerate service obligations for its CAF and RDOF locations under the companys existing management.13 Discussion We find, upon consideration of the record, that a grant of the Application will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. To make this determination under Commission precedent, we consider whether the proposed transaction could result in public interest harms by substantially frustrating or impairing the objectives or implementation of the Act or related statutes.14 We then employ a 6 Application at 3 see also Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Support Authorized for 5,657 Winning Bids, AU Docket No. 20-34, WC Docket Nos. 19-126, 10-90, Public Notice, DA 22-280 at Attach.

Subsidiaries, 292 balancing test that weighs any potential public interest harms of the proposed transaction against any potential public interest benefits.15 The Applicants bear the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the proposed transaction, on balance, serves the public interest.16 We find that the record contains no evidence of any potential public interest harms. First, the proposed transaction will not result in a reduction of competition. The PCMI entities are not affiliated with any domestic telecommunications carriers,17 and there will thus be no physical overlap or reduction in service providers in any markets as a result of the transaction. Further, Applicants state that the transaction will not impact IdeaTeks customers and will have no adverse or, indeed, any impact on customers and will not alter the planned manner of service delivery or billing.18 Applicants state further that no changes are planned to IdeaTeks rates, terms, and conditions of services,19 and we thus expect no potential harm to existing customers to result from the transaction. Second, IdeaTek will remain financially, managerially, and technically obligated to meet all public interest and performance obligations associated with the receipt of CAF Phase II and RDOF funding in accordance with the Commissions pre-transaction approval of its qualifications, and we expect that the proposed transaction will not negatively impact these obligations.20 Applicants have confirmed that the proposed transaction will not affect IdeaTeks deployment plans.21 Specifically, Applicants state The debt conversion will not adversely impact IdeaTeks ability to meet its CAF or RDOF commitments and, in fact, provides additional liquidity to accelerate buildout and growth and facilitate additional investment should it be necessary. The funds loaned to IdeaTek under the Convertible Note enabled IdeaTek to retire approximately 30 of its existing bank debt, and the conversion of the loan to equity will enhance IdeaTeks access to other sources of capital.22 Applicants have also confirmed that there will be no changes in the management of IdeaTek or the technology used by IdeaTek to provide service as a result of the proposed Transaction.23 Overall, we conclude that the record in this proceeding does not support a finding of a public interest harm.

In addition, IdeaTek has timely submitted required speed and latency pre-testing and testing results to USAC.29 Applicants state that the proposed transaction will further IdeaTeks progress moving forward and enhance IdeaTeks ability to perform its CAF and RDOF obligations and achieve its growth objectives.30 The Commission has specified that ensuring consumers receive new or additional services is an important public interest factor,31 and accelerating private sector deployment of advanced services is one of the aims of the Act.32 In light of the Applicants commitments to meet all of Licensees federal high cost funding obligations33 and the fact that Applicants are prepared to devote additional capital to accelerate facilities-based service offerings,34 we find it likely that the proposed transaction would result in some public interest benefits. Absent any potential harms, and considering that the proposed transaction is likely to yield some benefits, we find, on balance, that the proposed transaction serves the public interest.

INTRODUCTION 1. Section 17.47b of the Commissions rules requires antenna structure owners to conduct quarterly inspections of certain lighting systems1 section 17.47c exempts from that requirement systems that the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Bureau has found to include self-diagnostic features sufficient to make the quarterly inspections unnecessary.2 In this Memorandum Opinion and Order, we determine that the American Electric Power Service Corporation Monitoring System AEPMS satisfies the criteria of section 17.47c and that American Electric Power Service Corporations AEP antenna structures using that system are therefore exempt from the quarterly inspection requirement.3 Our action today should encourage other tower owners to invest in state-of-the-art technologies so that they, too, will become capable of continuous monitoring of both their lighting systems and control devices. II. BACKGROUND 2. Section 17.47b provides that the owner of any antenna structure that is registered with the Commission and that has been assigned lighting specifications pursuant to part 17 shall inspect at 1 47 CFR  17.47b. 2 47 CFR  17.47c. 3 In the matter of American Electric Power Service Corporation Request for Waiver of 47 C.F.R.  17.47b, Request for Waiver, filed January 10, 2022 AEP Request. On May 12, 2022, the Bureaus Competition and Infrastructure Policy Division CIPD requested additional information. See Letter from Jill A.

On December 29, 2022, AEP supplemented its waiver request with information regarding the technical characteristics and operational capabilities of the AEPMS. See Email from Donald R. Schiller, Network Consultant Lead, American Electric Power Service Corporation, to Michael C. Smith, Program Analyst, Competition and Infrastructure Policy Division, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau December 29, 2022 AEP Supplement II. 296 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-43 intervals not to exceed 3 months all automatic or mechanical control devices, indicators, and alarm systems associated with the antenna structure lighting to insure that such apparatus is functioning properly.4 Section 17.47c exempts from this requirement any antenna structure monitored by a system that the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has determined includes self-diagnostic features sufficient to render quarterly inspections unnecessary, upon certification of use of such system to the Bureau.5 3. AEP provides monitoring for its affiliates and subsidiaries, currently in 375 sites across the United States, which are subject to the Commissions lighting requirements in part 17.6 AEP filed a petition with the Bureau asking us to determine that the self-diagnostic functions of the AEPMS are sufficiently robust to ensure that the control devices, indicators, and alarm systems on antenna structures using the AEPMS are operating properly, such that quarterly inspections are unnecessary.7 AEP argues that the quarterly inspections of antenna monitoring systems mandated by section 17.47b have been rendered unnecessary because of technological advancements associated with the AEPMS. AEP asks us to modify the Quarterly Inspection requirement to provide that such inspections be made annually with regard to all AEPs monitored towers8 pursuant to section 17.47c.9 4. Specifically, AEP asserts in its petition that the AEPMS is similar to systems that have previously supported waiver grants10 and is a sophisticated, proven technology that is highly accurate and reliable.11 AEP asserts that its system employs self-diagnostic functions that are sufficiently robust so as to make unnecessary quarterly inspections to ensure that the control devices, indicators, and alarm systems on the towers are operating properly.12 AEP maintains that the AEPMS provides the functional equivalent of a continuous inspection of control devices on all towers it monitors. As a result, AEP states that users of the AEP System, like users of the Eagle and Hark Systems, systems for which the Commission previously approved waivers of section 17.47b, are alerted to actual and potential problems immediately in many cases and at most within twenty-four hours.13 In support of these contentions, AEP describes the alarm notification, 24-hour polling, manual contact, and staffing and fail- safe procedures of the systems as set forth below. 4 47 CFR  17.47b. 5 47 CFR  17.47c. 6 AEP Request at 3. 7 Id at 1. 8 Id. 9 Before creating the procedure for exemptions in section 17.47c, the Commission granted limited waivers of section 17.47b and permitted antenna structure owners to conduct annual, rather than quarterly, inspections. After 2014, section 17.47c rendered such waivers unnecessary. See 2004 and 2006 Biennial Regulatory Reviews  Streamlining and Other Revisions of Parts 1 and 17 of the Commissions Rules Governing Construction, Marking and Lighting of Antenna Structures Amendments to Modernize and Clarify Part 17 of the Commissions Rules Concerning Construction, Marking and Lighting of Antenna Structures, Report and Order, 29 FCC Rcd 9787, 9799- 9802 2014 Part 17 Order. Accordingly, we treat AEPs waiver request as a petition for relief of quarterly or annual inspection obligations pursuant to section 17.47c on our own motion. 10 AEP Request at 4, 10, 12. 11 Id. at 5, 12. 12 Id. at 10. 13 Id. at 4 see also In the Matter of Requests of American Tower Corporation and Global Signal, Inc., to Waive Section 17.47b of the Commissions Rules, WT Docket No. 05-326, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 22 FCC Rcd 9743 2007 ATC and Global Tower Waiver Order waiving section 17.47b requirements for users of the Eagle and Hark Systems. 297 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-43 5. Alarm notification. At each AEPMS monitored tower, the tower site receives alarms from the light controller, which contacts the AEP Network Operations Center NOC for every type of alarm condition.14 The AEPMS classifies alarms as either critical or minor, with beaconstrobeflashing sidelight failure, beaconstrobe communication failure, photo cell failure, site communication failure, power failure, GPS Sync failure, filter failure, low flash energy, and consecutive missed flashes treated as critical15, and side and single marker failure classified as minor.16 These alarms are captured and archived within the AEPMS database, which has an automated escalation protocol. If, after 30 minutes, the problem is not corrected and the alarm requires a Notice to Airmen NOTAM 17 to be filed, AEP NOC personnel issue and record a manual NOTAM.18 In the event of a NOTAM-worthy event, NOC personnel create a field service ticket for a site equipment inspection, with such inspections to be completed within 7 days.19 Personnel can also log into the system database and check the site anytime to perform additional diagnostics and troubleshooting and can attempt to correct the problem remotely.20 6. 24-hour polling. The AEP System is programmed to proactively initiate a connection from each monitored site at least once every hour or 24 times per every 24 hours.21 In the event communications are lost, the system generates an alarm requiring a NOC Technician to attempt to contact the site manually. If the NOC Technician is unable to connect to the tower, a NOTAM is issued and alerts are sent to the designated responsible site contacts for follow up. If alarms are cleared automatically then updates are recorded in the system database.22 Once the issue is corrected and site correct operation verified, the NOTAM is canceled and recorded in an electronic database and stored for 5 years.23 7. Manual contact. The AEPMS allows NOC technicians to perform a manual diagnostic review of any tower monitored by the system from any computer connected to the internet and a secure connection to AEPs network.24 That function enables personnel to contact the AEPMS at the tower and review the operational status of the tower's lighting system at any time.25 As a result, NOC personnel can remotely perform diagnostics and troubleshoot a problem, potentially correcting it remotely.26 14 Id. at 8. 15 Id. at 4-5, 7. 16 Id. at 5. 17 Antenna structure owners shall report immediately to the FAA, by means acceptable to the FAA, any observed or otherwise known extinguishment or improper functioning of any top steady burning light or any flashing obstruction light, regardless of its position on the antenna structure, not corrected within 30 minutes. 47 CFR  17.48a see also FAA Circular AC-707460-1M, Chapter 2, Section 2.4 Light Failure Notification. 18 AEP Request at 7, 8-9. 19 Id. at 7. 20 Id. at 9 AEP Supplement at Q1 response. 21 AEP Request at 9. 22 Id. 23 Id. 24 Id. 25 Id. at 9-10. 26 Id. at 6, 9 AEP Supplement at Q1 response. 298 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-43 8. Staffing and Fail-Safe Procedures. According to AEP, the AEPMS receives and reports alarms that are activated when the self-diagnostic functions of the obstruction lighting systems determine that there is a lighting malfunction. These monitoring devices are microcomputer-based and include programmable delays to prevent false alarms, alphanumeric labeling for input and output circuits to remove confusion as to the origin of alarms, and the capability of handling a variety of two-way communications to the NOC. The AEPMS allows NOC personnel to remotely perform inspections on the fly to ensure normal operation.27 In addition, AEP monitors server health at both the physical and operating system levels, including monitoring software that is external to the server to ensure that the server components of the system are running properly.28 9. To monitor the alarms, AEPs NOC and backup NOC are staffed with trained personnel capable of responding to alarms 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, which allows personnel to easily shift to either location quickly in the event that one site is compromised.29 The NOC is located at AEPs primary facility in Gahanna, OH, which includes a backup diesel generator that helps prevent power failure at the facility.30 AEPs NOC personnel can also access the system from any computer in the world.31 In the event of a catastrophe, AEP has a backup NOC in Groveport, OH32 and has prepared a detailed disaster recovery procedures plan that would be placed into effect.33 Since the primary and secondary locations are manned, personnel can easily shift to either location quickly in the event that one site is compromised.34 The existence of two NOC centers is an important fail-safe mechanism, as it allows the backup center to assume monitoring responsibilities in the event of a catastrophic failure at the primary center.35 10. In the event that both NOCs were to become incapacitated and suffer complete failures, AEP NOC technicians can connect from any physical location using a secure internet connection to the Telenium alarm servers.36 In addition, ten off-site NOC contractors have remote Telenium alarm server access for uninterrupted alarm monitoring.37 The transfer of monitoring would be immediate since off- site users are able to access the Telenium servers from any remote location through AEPs VPN network, which includes redundancies via New Albany, OH and Tulsa, OK.38 These fail-safe procedures ensure that robust monitoring of the towers will continue even if one or both of the NOC centers is rendered inoperable. 11. Further, there is battery backup at both the sites and the NOC, as well as redundant communications systems within the AEP System.39 Battery backup for the vast majority of the sites have both local generators and battery systems that ensure power for several days, while some of the sites have 27 AEP Request at 5-6 AEP Supplement at Q1 response. 28 AEP Request at 8. 29 Id. at 5 AEP Supplement at Q1 response, Q34 response. 30 AEP Request at 10, 11 AEP Supplement at Q34 response. 31 AEP Request at 9-10. 32 Id. at 11 AEP Supplement at Q34 response. 33 AEP Request at 9-10. 34 Id. at 11 AEP Supplement at Q34 response. 35 AEP Request at 11 AEP Supplement at Q34 response. 36 AEP Request at 9 AEP Supplement at Q34 response. 37 AEP Supplement at Q34 response. 38 AEP Request at 6 AEP Supplement at Q34 response. 39 AEP Request at 6. 299 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-43 solar power systems with seven days of autonomy.40 AEP states that 8 of the current AEPMS sites are designed with battery backup able to maintain communications links to the alarm system for only 2-3 hours41 however, AEP states that these sites are located within urban areas where field techs are quickly available, 247365, to resolve the issue well within the 23 hour battery backup window,42 and that power to these locations is often restored automatically by distribution switching or as part of the utilitys power restoration plan.43 Communications of events to the AEP NOC are provided using digital cellular communications with 99.5 availability, andor AEPs internal network, designed with 99.999 availability.44 The AEP System includes redundant systems using ring architecture, which, upon failure of a single transport node andor cellular gateway, immediately switches to a backup to restore connectivity to the light controller. In the event that the light controller loses communications to the alarm server, the AEP System has redundant cellular gateways through the two Telenium alarm servers. The built-in redundancies ensure that the AEP Systems notifications are sent immediately in the event of an alarm.45 III. DISCUSSION 12. We find that the AEPMS includes self-diagnostic features sufficient to render quarterly inspections unnecessary46 and is similar to the monitoring systems we have evaluated in other orders. On May 15, 2007, the Commission granted American Tower Corporation ATC and Global Signal, Inc. GSI waivers of section 17.47b to allow annual, rather than quarterly, inspection of towers monitored by specified, technologically advanced monitoring systems.47 In the 2014 Part 17 Order, the Commission granted exemptions from all inspection obligations to those entities previously granted a waiver for their antenna structures monitored by qualifying systems, as long as they continued to meet the advanced monitoring obligations to which they had already certified.48 Since then, the Bureau has, on delegated authority, granted similar waivers to entities demonstrating that their systems were similarly robust, and were operated in a similar manner, to the systems described in the ATC and Global Tower Waiver Order.49 Accordingly, we find that the AEPMS, when used in the manner described by AEP, justifies an exemption from the quarterly inspection requirement of section 17.47b pursuant to section 17.47c. 13. The technology that the AEPMS employs is similar to that exhibited by other monitoring systems that we have previously found to be sufficiently robust to support waivers based on the efficacy of their system and backup procedures. The AEPMS is similar in that it has a continuous and permanent 40 Id. 41 Id. 42 AEP Supplement at Q2 response see also AEP Supplement II stating that technicians are available 247365. 43 AEP Supplement II. 44 AEP Request at 6. 45 AEP Request at 6-7 AEP Supplement at Q34 response, Q5 response. 46 47 CFR  17.47c. 47 See ATC and Global Tower Waiver Order, 22 FCC Rcd 9748, para. 18. 48 Part 17 Order, 29 FCC Rcd at 9801, para 34. 49 See United States Cellular Corporation Request for Waiver of 47 C.F.R.  17.47b, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 30 FCC Rcd 5026 WTB 2015 Petition of Cellco Partnership For Exemption from 47 CFR  17.47b Vanguard Monitoring System Petition of Cellco Partnership For Exemption from 47 CFR  17.47b QLI Monitoring System, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 34 FCC Rcd 3759 WTB 2019.

Based on the record before us, and consistent with previous Commission and Bureau orders, the Bureau finds that the AEPMS includes self-diagnostic features sufficient to render quarterly inspections unnecessary.57 We conclude that the AEPMS is a safe and reliable monitoring system with tracking mechanisms that ensure proper functioning of their remote monitoring technology. Such advanced technology provides the benefits of more rapid response in case of a lighting failure. As a result, the AEPMS, when used in the manner described by AEP, justifies an exemption from the quarterly inspection requirement of section 17.47b. Therefore, pursuant to section 17.47c, AEP is exempt from section 17.47b with regard to any of its towers monitored by the AEPMS in the manner described in this Order. This will enable AEP to more efficiently carry out its responsibilities under part 17 of the Commissions rules.58 Our actions today should encourage other tower owners to invest in state-of-the- art technologies so that they, too, will become capable of continuous monitoring of both their lighting systems and control devices.

By the Acting Chief, Office of Engineering and Technology -FCC- 304 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-45 Before the Federal Communications Commission Washington, D.C. 20554 In the Matter of   Lingo Telecom, LLC  Complaint No. 5908094  Complaint Regarding  Unauthorized Change of  Subscribers Telecommunications Carrier  ORDER Adopted January 18, 2023 Released January 18, 2023 By the Acting Chief, Consumer Policy Division, Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau 1. In this Order, we consider a complaint alleging that Lingo Telecom, LLC Lingo changed Complainants telecommunications service provider without obtaining authorization and verification from Complainant as required by the Commissions rules.1 We conclude that Lingos actions violated the Commissions slamming rules, and we therefore grant Complainants complaint. 2. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended the Act, prohibits the practice of slamming, the submission or execution of an unauthorized change in a subscribers selection of a provider of telephone exchange service or telephone toll service.2 The Commissions implementing rules require, among other things, that a carrier receive individual subscriber consent before a carrier change may occur.3 Specifically, a carrier must 1 obtain the subscribers written or electronically signed authorization in a format that satisfies our rules 2 obtain confirmation from the subscriber via a toll-free number provided exclusively for the purpose of confirming orders electronically or 3 utilize an appropriately qualified independent third party to verify the order.4 The Commission has also adopted rules to limit the liability of subscribers when an unauthorized carrier change occurs, and to require carriers involved in slamming practices to compensate subscribers whose carriers were changed without authorization.5 3. The Commissions slamming rules prohibit misrepresentations on sales calls to further reduce the incidence of slamming.6 Under the rules, upon a finding of material misrepresentation during 1 See Informal Complaint No. 5908094 filed Dec. 9, 2022 see also 47 CFR  64.1100  64.1190. 2 47 U.S.C.  258a. 3 See 47 CFR  64.1120. 4 See id.  64.1120c. Section 64.1130 details the requirements for letter of agency form and content for written or electronically signed authorizations. Id.  64.1130. 5 These rules require the unauthorized carrier to absolve the subscriber where the subscriber has not paid his or her bill. If the subscriber has not already paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the subscriber is absolved of liability for charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier for service provided during the first 30 days after the unauthorized change. See id.  64.1140, 64.1160. Any charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier on the subscriber for service provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the subscriber to the authorized carrier at the rates the subscriber was paying to the authorized carrier at the time of the unauthorized change. Id. Where the subscriber has paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the Commissions rules require that the unauthorized carrier pay 150 percent of those charges to the authorized carrier, and the authorized carrier shall refund or credit to the subscriber 50 percent of all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier. See id.  64.1140, 64.1170. 6 Id.  64.1120a1iA. 305 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-45 the sales call, the consumers authorization to change carriers will be deemed invalid even if the carrier has some evidence of consumer authorization of a carrier switch, e.g., a third-party verification TPV recording. Sales misrepresentations may not be cured by a facially valid TPV.7 The rule provides that a consumers credible allegation of misrepresentation shifts the burden of proof to the carrier to provide evidence to rebut the consumers claim regarding misrepresentation. The Commission made clear that an accurate and complete recording of the sales call may be the carriers best persuasive evidence to rebut the consumers claim that a misrepresentation was made on the sales call.8 4. We received Complainants complaint alleging that Complainants telecommunications service provider had been changed without Complainants authorization.9 In the complaint, Complainant also alleged that she received a call from someone who claimed to be with ATT, her companys existing carrier.10 5. Pursuant to our rules, we notified Lingo of the complaint, directing Lingo to address the specific misrepresentation allegation and to provide any evidence to rebut it.11 With its response, Lingo provided an audio recording that it characterized as a Quality Control Call, along with a contract Lingo said Complainant signed.12 Lingo did not, however, address Complainants misrepresentation allegation and did not provide a recording of the sales call or any other evidence related to the sales call.13 6. Based on the evidence in the record, we find Complainants allegation of a sales call misrepresentation to be credible. We further find that Lingo has failed to provide persuasive evidence to rebut Complainants misrepresentation claim and therefore that Complainants authorization to change carriers is invalid.14 As the Commission stated in the 2018 Slamming Order, when a consumers decision to switch carriers is predicated on false information provided in a sales call, that consumers authorization to switch carriers can no longer be considered binding.15 We therefore find that Lingos actions resulted in an unauthorized change in Complainants telecommunications service provider, as defined by the rules, and we discuss Lingos liability below.16 7 See Protecting Consumers from Unauthorized Carrier Changes and Related Unauthorized Charges, 33 FCC Rcd 5773, 5778-80, paras. 17-19 2018 2018 Slamming Order 47 CFR  64.1120a1iA. 8 See 2018 Slamming Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 5781, para. 23. The Commission also stated that a carrier is uniquely positioned via its access to sales scripts, recordings, training, and other relevant materials relating to sales calls to proffer evidence to rebut a consumers claims. Id. 9 See Informal Complaint No. 5908094. 10 Id. 11 47 CFR  1.719 Commission procedure for informal complaints filed pursuant to section 258 of the Act id.  64.1150 procedures for resolution of unauthorized changes in preferred carrier. 12 See Lingo Response to Informal Complaint No. 5908094 filed Jan. 11, 2023 Lingo Response. 13 Lingo simply stated that Complainant would have been advised that the Company utilizes ATT as the underlying provider, but that Lingo would be the carrier and would be invoicing for the services, as well as handling all customer service questions or concerns. See Lingo Response at 1. 14 We also note that on the Quality Control Call Lingo submitted, the Lingo representative informs the consumer that ATT will continue to operate Complainants telephone lines. 15 2018 Slamming Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 5779, para. 18 citing Advantage Forfeiture Order, 32 FCC Rcd 3723, 3725-30, paras. 7-13 2017 finding that the carriers TPV recordings did not disprove that unlawful misrepresentations were made during the telemarketing calls and further, that questions posed during the separate TPV calls did not cure those misrepresentations. 16 If Complainant is unsatisfied with the resolution of the complaint, the Complainant may file a formal complaint with the Commission pursuant to Section 1.721 of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  1.721. Such filing will be continued. 306 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-45 7. Lingo must remove all charges incurred for service provided to Complainant for the first thirty days after the alleged unauthorized change in accordance with the Commissions liability rules.17 We have determined that Complainant is entitled to absolution for the charges incurred during the first thirty days after the unauthorized change occurred and that neither the Complainants authorized carrier nor Lingo may pursue any collection against Complainant for those charges.18 Any charges imposed by Lingo on the Complainant for service provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the Complainant to the authorized carrier at the rates the Complainant was paying the authorized carrier at the time of the unauthorized change of their telecommunications service provider.19 8. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  258, and sections 0.141, 0.361, and 1.719 of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  0.141, 0.361, 1.719, the complaint filed against Lingo Telecom, LLC IS GRANTED. 9. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to section 64.1170d of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  64.1170d, Complainant is entitled to absolution for the charges incurred during the first thirty days after the unauthorized change occurred and that Lingo Telecom, LLC may not pursue any collection against Complainant for those charges. 10. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order is effective upon release. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Kristi Thornton Acting Chief Consumer Policy Division Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau deemed to relate back to the filing date of Complainants informal complaint so long as the formal complaint is filed within 45 days from the date this order is mailed or delivered electronically to Complainant.

INTRODUCTION 1. The Media Bureau Bureau has before it G.I.G., Inc. G.I.G., licensee of low power television LPTV station KCPO-LP, Sioux Falls, South Dakota KCPO-LP or Station. In this Memorandum Opinion and Order and Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture NAL,1 we find that G.I.G. apparently willfully violated section 74.7882 of the Rules by failing to timely file a license to cover application for the Station, and willfully and repeatedly violated section 73.1745 of the Rules and 301 of the Act,3 by engaging in unauthorized operation. Based upon our review of the facts and circumstances before us, we conclude that G.I.G. is apparently liable for a monetary forfeiture in the amount of six thousand, five hundred dollars 6,500. Upon resolution of the forfeiture proceeding commenced herein and so long as there are no other issues that would preclude such action, we will grant G.I.G.s pending application to renew the Stations license for a period of two years.4 1 This NAL is issued pursuant to sections 309k and 503b of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended Act, and section 1.80 of the Commissions rules Rules. See 47 U.S.C.  309k, 503b 47 CFR  1.80. The Bureau has delegated authority to issue the NAL under section 0.283 of the Rules. See 47 CFR  0.283. 2 See 47 CFR  74.788 2022. Effective October 24, 2022, 47 CFR  74.788 of the Commissions rules was eliminated and found by the commission to be duplicative with 47 CFR  73.3598 of the Rules. See 87 FR 58200, Oct. 24, 2022 In the Matter of Amend. of Parts 73 and 74 of the Commission's Rules to Establish Rules for Digital Low Power Television and Television Translator Stations, Update of Parts 74 of the Commissions Rules Related to Low Power Television and Television Translator Stations, FCC 22-58 July 13, 2022 47 CFR  74.780 bbb making 47 CFR  73.3598 applicable to all TV translator and LPTV stations. At the time the violation at issue occurred, 47 CFR  74.788 was in effect however, to the extent necessary we also find that the Licensee violated 47 CFR  73.3598. 3 See 47 CFR  73.1745 and 47 U.S.C.  301. 4 See LMS File No. 0000176044. 308 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-46 II. BACKGROUND 2. KCPO-LP was a former analog low power television LPTV station. The Station, like all other analog stations, was required to cease analog operations by 1159 p.m. on July 13, 2021.5 On March 31, 2020, the Station filed a construction permit to flash-cut its analog operations to digital operations on its licensed analog channel 26 Digital CP.6 That application was granted on April 20, 2020. Pursuant to Commission rules, the Station was assigned a construction permit expiration date of July 13, 2021.7 On April 28, 2021, the Station was granted an extension of its construction permit to January 10, 2022 CP Extension.8 In the CP Extension, G.I.G. represented that construction of the Station had not been completed and laid out a timeline for completing construction. No subsequent request for tolling was filed. 3. As discussed in further detail below, the Licensee has stated that it commenced digital operations pursuant to the Digital CP on April 21, 2020. On July 29, 2022, G.I.G. filed a request for silent authority notifying the commission that the Station went silent on July 27, 2022 due to the loss its site.9 In addition, the Licensee filed a request for special temporary authority to commence operations from a new location while it finalizes a construction permit to move to the proposed site on a permanent basis.10 Both the Silent STA and Engineering STA applications remain pending. 4. Section 74.788b of the Commissions rules stated that Any construction permit for which construction has not been completed and for which an application for license or extension of time has not been filed, shall be automatically forfeited upon expiration without any further affirmative cancellation by the Commission.11 Although G.I.G. has maintained that it completed construction and began operating its digital facility on April 21, 2020,12 it failed to file a timely application for license to cover after completing construction. As such, the Digital CP automatically expired on its own terms on January 11, 2021. 5. On December 1, 2021, G.I.G. filed an application for license renewal Renewal Application. In that application G.I.G. certified that the Station was operational. As part of Video 5 See 47 CFR  74.788a 2022 Amendment of Parts 73 and 74 of the Commissions Rules to Establish Rules for Digital Low Power Television and Television Translator Stations, MB Docket No. 03-185, Third Report and Order and Fourth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 30 FCC Rcd 14927, 14932-33, para. 9 2015. In that decision, the Commission extended the LPTV digital transition date and all valid digital construction permit expiration dates for analog stations until 12 months following the completion of the 39-month post-Incentive Auction transition period, or 51 months from the completion of the Incentive Auction and the release of the Closing and Channel Reassignment Public Notice. Id. See Incentive Auction Closing and Channel Reassignment Public Notice The Broadcast Television Incentive Auction Closes Reverse Auction and Forward Auction Results Announced Final Television Band Channel Assignments Announced Post-Auction Deadlines Announced, Public Notice, 32 FCC Rcd 2786 IATF and MB 2018 Closing and Channel Reassignment Public Notice. Given the April 13, 2017 release date of the Closing and Channel Reassignment Public Notice, the LPTV digital transition date and expiration date of all analog stations digital construction permits were set as July 13, 2021. 47 CFR  74.731.

As a result, on May 20, 2022, the Division sent G.I.G a letter inquiring as to the Stations operational history.13 On July 5 and 11, 2022 the Licensee filed two separate responses to the Divisions inquiry letter asserting that G.I.G. in fact completed construction of its digital facility in April 2020 July Responses.14 In addition, on July 11, 2022, the Licensee filed a License Application and requested waiver of all applicable rules and grant of the application.15 Following a series of phone calls in August 2022 between Division staff and legal counsel for G.I.G., on September 14 and September 22, 2022 G.I.G. submitted another series of responses to the Bureau attempting to demonstrate that the Station was constructed and had been operating since April 2020.16 Included with its July and September Responses were declarations from viewers, program logs, certain financial information related to the operation of the station, a declaration from the Stations tower owner, and photographs of the facility.17 6. Upon review of G.I.G.s July and September Reponses, Division staff determined that the information G.I.G. submitted was still incomplete. Therefore, on September 26, 2022, the Division sent an inquiry letter to G.I.G. providing it one final time to provide documentation and information necessary to determine that the Station had been constructed and that grant of the Stations late-filed license to cover is warranted.18 In its response filed on November 4, 2022, G.I.G. provided the additional documents requested by the Division. It also reiterated that its failure to file a timely license to cover was inadvertent and that its request for additional time to construct filed in March 2021 was at the advice of its consulting engineer and it appears to have been in error.19 13 Letter, from Barbara A. Kreisman, Chief, Video Division, FCC Media Bureau, to G.I.G., Inc. May. 20, 2022 on file under LMS main facility page for Facility ID No. 26041 Inquiry Letter. We note that because the construction permit had not yet been canceled in LMS, the Station was able to file a license to cover application against its expired construction permit. Cancellation of a stations construction permit and deletion of its call sign by Media Bureau Bureau staff in the Licensing and Management System LMS is an administerial function and does not constitute an official Commission action nor require any affirmative cancellation by the Commission. See 47 CFR 74.788b 2022 and supra note 2 Media Bureau Reminds Remaining Low Power Television and Television Translator Stations that the July 13, 2021 Digital Transition Date and Oher Important Deadlines are One Week Away, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 10364 MB 2021. As a result, failure by Bureau staff to cancel a construction permit in LMS does not result in an expired construction permit remaining valid. 14 See July 5, 2022 Response at 1, supra n. 10 and Letter, from Aaron P.

G.I.G. states that because the Stations consulting engineer is now deceased, G.I.G. is unable to ascertain specific information related to the filing and its substance. Sept. 14, 2022 Response at 1. 310 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-46 7. G.I.G. maintains that grant of its License Application is clearly in the public interest for stations to continue operation.20 G.I.G. also argues that that the appropriate penalty in this case should not be the draconian cancellation of the permit, but, rather, the imposition of a forfeiture.21 III. DISCUSSION 8. Pursuant to section 503b1B of the Act,22 a person who is found to have willfully or repeatedly failed to comply with any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commission shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty.23 Section 312f1 of the Act defines willful as the conscious and deliberate commission or omission of any act, irrespective of any intent to violate the law.24 The legislative history to section 312f1 of the Act clarifies that this definition of willful applies to both sections 312 and 503b of the Act,25 and the Commission has so interpreted the term in the section 503b context.26 Section 312f2 of the Act provides that the term repeated, when used with reference to the commission or omission of any act, means the commission or omission of such act more than once or, if such commission or omission is continuous, for more than one day.27 9. Apparent Violation. The facts recited above appear to demonstrate that G.I.G. willfully violated section 74.788a of the Rules by failing to file a timely license to cover application upon completion of construction of the Station in April 2020.28 G.I.G. stated that its failure to timely file for a license to cover was inadvertent and its actions or lack thereof were taken at the advice of its engineering consultant. However, it is well settled precedent that licensees are responsible for compliance with the Commissions rules and that inadvertence does not excuse a violation or non- compliance. 29 Furthermore, applicants and licensees are responsible for the errors of their staff.30 Even though the Station is currently silent, as a result of its failure to file a timely license to cover, G.I.G. also engaged in unauthorized operation for over two years April 21, 2020 through July 27, 2022 in violation 20 Sept. 14, 2022 Response at 3. 21 Nov. 4, 2022 Response at 26, Sept. 14, 2022 Response at 4 both citing Methow Valley Communications District, DA 22-627 June 10, 2022. 22 47 U.S.C.  503b1B. 23 Id.

Henderson, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 33 FCC Rcd 3385, 3387-88, para. 6 2018 rejecting argument that licensee's engineer was to blame for station's unauthorized operations. 311 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-46 of section 73.1745 of the Rules31 and 301 of the Act.32 We therefore find that G.I.G. has apparently violated the Rules and Act and is apparently liable for forfeiture. 10. Proposed Forfeiture Amount. The Commission's Forfeiture Policy Statement and section 1.80b10 of the Rules establish a base forfeiture amount of 3,000 for the failure to file a required form.33 The guidelines also specify a base forfeiture amount of 10,000 for construction and operation without an instrument of authorization for the service.34 In determining the appropriate forfeiture amount, we may adjust the base amount upward or downward by considering the factors enumerated in section 503b2E of the Act, including the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation, and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may require.35 11. In this case, G.I.G. failed to timely-file for a license to cover and engaged in unauthorized operation of the Station for over two years. Taking into consideration all of the factors required by section 503b2E of the Act and the Forfeiture Policy Statement, we will reduce the forfeiture from the base amount to 6,500 because, as a low power station, KPCO-LP is providing a secondary service.36 While in other cases we have fined other low power television and TV translator licensees 3,500 for similar violations,37 we believe an increased amount is warranted here given the lengthy period of time over two years the Station engaged in unauthorized operation compared to those other cases four to six months. Stations are only permitted to commence operation pursuant to a valid instrument of authorization and we find that G.I.G.s failure represents extreme disregard of Commissions licensing processes and the Act itself. 12. Renewal Application. In evaluating an application for license renewal, the Commissions decision is governed by Section 309k of the Act.38 That Section provides that if, upon consideration of the application and pleadings, we find that 1 the station has served the public interest, convenience, and necessity 2 there have been no serious violations of the Act or the Rules and 3 there have been no other violations which, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse, we are to grant the renewal 31 47 CFR  73.1745 prohibiting unauthorized operation. 32 47 U.S.C.  301 requiring an authorization to transmit a broadcast signal. 33 See Forfeiture Policy Statement and Amendment of Section 1.80b of the Rules to Incorporate the Forfeiture Guidelines, Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd 17087, 17113-15 1997 Forfeiture Policy Statement, recon. denied, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 15 FCC Rcd 303 1999 47 CFR  1.80b10, note to paragraph b10, Section I. See also Clear Channel, 26 FCC Rcd at 7157 We note that the staff may also issue Notices of Apparent Liability for failure to file a required form as authorized by Section 503b1B of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended the Act and Section 1.80 of the Rules, for such violations of covering license application filing deadlines or take other enforcement action.. 34 A broadcast station requires an authorization from the Commission to operate.

Nov. 5, 2021 proposing 3,500 forfeiture for late filed application for license to cover and six months unauthorized operations paid Nov. 30, 2021 The Estate of Ettie Clark, Memorandum Opinion and Order and Notice of Apparent Liability, DA 22-327 rel. Mar. 28, 2022 finding that although the station is secondary, a forfeiture in the amount of 6,500 was warranted given the lengthy period of time over three years the station engaged in unauthorized operation paid Apr. 19, 2022. 37 See id. 38 47 U.S.C.  309k. 312 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-46 application.39 If, however, the licensee fails to meet that standard, the Commission may deny the applicationafter notice and opportunity for a hearing under Section 309e of the Actor grant the application on terms and conditions that are appropriate, including a renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted.40 13. In this case, we find G.I.G.s unauthorized operation of the Station, coupled with its lack of diligence and knowledge with regards to the Commissions rules does not warrant routine license renewal. Not only did G.I.G. fail to file the required license application, but this error was compounded by the filing of its construction permit extension that proved to be unnecessary and contain inaccurate information. The Licensee also engaged in a pattern of failing to fully reply to the Divisions inquiries, resulting in an extensive delay in resolving the Divisions investigation and ultimately depriving the public of the service being provided by the Station. 14. Despite this, we find that designation for evidentiary hearing is not warranted here. Instead, in addition to the proposed forfeiture, we put in place additional measures to ensure that the Station complies with the Act and the Rules in the future. Specifically, pursuant to Section 309k2 of the Act, upon resolution of the forfeiture proceeding commenced herein and so long as there are no other issues that would preclude grant, we will renew the Stations license for a term of two years. This short- term renewal will afford the Commission an opportunity to review the Stations compliance with the Act and the Rules and to take whatever corrective actions, if any, that may be warranted at that time. 15. Other Pending Matters. In light of the facts and circumstances discussed above, and our findings that forfeiture and a short term renewal are sufficient sanction for G.I.G.s apparent violations, we will grant G.I.G.s request for waiver of section 74.788 of the Rules and reinstate the construction permit.41 We will act on KCPO-LPs Silent STA, Engineering STA, and License Application under separate action upon conclusion of this forfeiture proceeding. IV. ORDERING CLAUSES 16.

The remedial LStar Equity Petition was filed to report the foreign ownership that occurred as result of the consummation of the LStar Equity Transaction. The LStar Equity Petitioners state that, as a result of the LStar Equity Transaction, LStar Equity holds a 71.8 equity interest and 66.6 voting interest in JAB Wireless, the controlling U.S. parent of the Wireless Licensees.29 According to the petition, the remaining 28.2 equity interest and 33.3 voting interest in JAB Wireless is held by other investors, each holding less than 10 interest in JAB Wireless.30 The LStar Equity Petitioners contend that the limited partnership interests in LStar Equity are fully insulated in accordance with section 1.5003 of the Commissions rules.31 As a result of the completion of the LStar Equity Transaction, LStar Equity is owned or controlled by Fund VIII Intl 58 equity and voting Delaware, Fund VIII US 40 equity and voting Delaware, and LSF VIII Investments, L.P. 1.98 equity and voting Bermuda.32 LStar Management Delaware, as the sole general partner of LStar Equity, holds 0 equity and 100 voting interest.33 23 Id. 24 Id. at Exh.

Given that the LStar Equity Transaction has already been consummated and that the proposed acquisition of JAB Wireless by GI DI Iris Acquisition will remove the LStar Equity ownership in JAB Wireless, the LStar Equity Petitioners do not seek advance approval pursuant to section 1.5001k of the Commissions rules for any of the foreign interests related to the LStar Equity Transaction.54 We received no comments regarding foreign ownership interests of the LStar Equity Petition. Based on our review of the record, under section 310b4 of the Act and the Commissions foreign ownership rules and policies, we find that the public intertest would not be served by prohibiting foreign ownership of JAB Wireless, the controlling U.S. parent, in excess of the 25 benchmarks in section 48 Id. at Exh.

LStar Equity Petitioners contend that the limited partners of five entities should be considered insulated pursuant to section 1.5003 of the Commissions rules. The five entities are 1 Fund VIII US, 2 Fund VIII International, 3 Fund IX US, 4 Partners VIII, and 5 Partners IX. LStar Petitioners further assert that such limited partners hold less than 10 equity or voting interest in LStar Equity. According to the LStar Equity Petition, the Limited Partnership Agreement for Fund VIII US prohibits limited partners from taking part in the management or operation of the business and from exercising any control of the business. LStar Equity Petitioners state that the Limited Partnership Agreement does, however, include a single provision that allows removal of the general partner without cause by a 70 vote of the limited partners. LStar Equity Petitioners make similar arguments with respect to Fund VIII International, Fund IX US, Partners VIII, and Partners IX. 47 CFR 1.5003 LStar Equity Petition at 11-14 LStar Equity Petition Dec. 8, 2022 Supplement at 1-2. Since the LStar Equity ownership in JAB Wireless will be removed once GI DI Iris Acquisition acquires JAB Wireless, which, as discussed below, is contingent upon the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction closing within fifteen 15 days of release of this Public Notice, we find that it is not necessary to make a determination on this request at this time. 54 47 CFR 1.5001k. 322 DADA 310b4 of the Act. We, therefore, grant the LStar Equity Petition subject to the conditions set forth herein. This ruling authorizes 100 aggregate foreign ownership of JAB Wireless as the controlling U.S. parent of the Wireless Licensees, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in section 1.5004 of the Commissions rules.55 As discussed below, grant of the LStar Equity Petition is conditioned on the removal of the LStar Equity ownership interest through the acquisition of JAB Wireless by GI DI Iris Acquisition within fifteen 15 days of the release of this Public Notice. While the LStar Equity Petitioners continue to have an ownership interest in JAB Wireless and the Wireless Licensees, they have an affirmative duty to monitor their foreign equity and voting interests, calculate their interests consistent with the principles enunciated by the Commission, including the standards and criteria set forth in sections 1.5002 through 1.5003 of the rules,56 and otherwise ensure continuing compliance with the provisions of section 310b of the Act.57 Failure to comply andor remain in compliance shall constitute grounds for declaring this ruling terminated without further action on the part of the Commission. Failure to meet a condition of this ruling may also result in monetary sanctions or other enforcement action by the Commission.

Skybeam and Essex, which are ETCs receiving fixed RBE support, will be affiliated post-consummation with ITS, an incumbent LEC that did not elect to receive fixed, model-based support and receives cost-based universal service support. Dec. 13, 2022 Supplement at 1-2 GI DI Iris Acquisition Application at 12. In the HargrayComSouth Order, the Commission found that the combination of two companies that receive high-cost universal service support under different mechanisms, one fixed and one cost-based, could result in potential harm to the Commissions goal of ensuring that limited universal service resources are distributed efficiently and effectively as a result of the companies having an incentive to shift costs from the fixed, model-based support company to the cost-based support company. Joint Application of W. Mansfield Jennings Limited Partnership and Hargray Communications Group, Inc. for Consent to the Transfer of Control of ComSouth Corporation Pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, WC Docket 18-52, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 33 FCC Rcd 4780, 4784, para. 19 2018 HargrayComSouth Order. Although GI GP DI LLC is the general partner that will ultimately control Skybeam, Essex, and ITS, the GI DI Iris Acquisition Applicants assert that there is no ability to engage in improper cost shifting as a result of its affiliates receiving universal service support under different mechanisms. Dec. 13, 2022 Supplement at 1-3. The GI DI Iris Acquisition Applicants affirm that the Skybeam and ITS do not have common control, shared or common costs, or consolidation of corporate books. Id. at 2. The Applicants state that GI DI Iris Acquisition, which ultimately controls Skybeam, and GI Blue Stream Holdings II LP Blue Stream, the entity that ultimately controls ITS, have different ownership, which precludes any consolidation of management or accounts between the two entities. Id. They further state that the fiduciary duties that GP owes to the limited partners in each of the two non-overlapping co-invest partnerships . . . would preclude it from shifting costs from one partnerships investment onto the partnership that holds another investment. The transaction will therefore not have the type of common control that will implicate a mixed-support condition as envisioned in the HargrayComSouth Order. Id. see Order on Reconsideration, WC Docket No. 20-389, 36 FCC Rcd 8859, 8864, para. 14 2021 stating that WCB should continue to apply the HargrayComSouth condition to remedy a potential public interest harm caused by a mixed support transaction, including in transactions in which post-merger affiliates have common control, common costs, cost sharing, or consolidation of corporate books. In light of the separate management control, cost accounting, and financial reporting of Skybeam and Essex and ITS, as demonstrated on this record, we do not find a potential public interest harm associated with a mixed support transaction that needs to be addressed, and therefore exercise our authority to exclude the GI DI Iris Acquisition Applicants from the HargrayComSouth condition. We therefore grant the GI DI Iris Acquisition Application without applying the mixed support condition. 67 GI DI Iris Acquisition Application at Exh. A at 4, Exh.

Based on our review of the record, under section 310b4 of the Act and the Commissions foreign ownership rules and policies, we find that the public intertest would not be served by prohibiting foreign ownership of JAB Wireless, the controlling U.S. parent, in excess of the 25 benchmarks in section 310b4 of the Act. We, therefore, grant the GI DI Iris Acquisition Petition subject to the conditions set forth herein. This ruling authorizes 100 aggregate foreign ownership of JAB Wireless as the controlling U.S. parent of the Wireless Licensees, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in section 1.5004 of the Commissions rules.89 According to the GI DI Iris Acquisition Petition, upon consummation of the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction, no foreign individual or entity will hold a 5 or greater direct or indirect equity andor voting interest in GI DI Iris Acquisition and Wireless Licensees.90 Therefore, the GI DI Iris Acquisition Petitioners do not request specific or advance approval for any foreign interest holders.91 We note that, pursuant to Section 1.5001 and 1.5004 of the Commissions rules, GI DI Iris Acquisition Petitioner is required to seek and obtain Commission approval before any foreign individual, entity, or 82 Id. 83 Id. 84 GI DI Iris Acquisition Application at Exh.

Failure to meet a condition of this ruling may also result in monetary sanctions or other enforcement action by the Commission. Executive Branch Review Under our rules and procedures, the Commission will generally refer petitions for section 310b foreign ownership rulings for common carrier wireless applicants and licensees and all the associated applications to the Executive Branch agencies Agencies for their views on any national security, law enforcement, foreign policy, or trade policy concerns related to the foreign ownership of the ApplicantsPetitioners.95 We did not formally refer either the LStar Equity Application and Petition or the GI DI Iris Acquisition Application and Petition to the Agencies.96 As the Applicants state, the foreign ownership at issue in the LStar Equity Transaction will be removed by the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction. Consequently, we found as a matter of discretion, that it would not be an efficient use of resources for the Agencies or the Commission to refer the Application and Petition in these circumstances.97 We also find that because the only reportable foreign ownership in JAB Wireless and its subsidiaries will be through wholly owned intermediate holding companies and the ultimate ownership and control is held by U.S. citizens or entities, the GI DI Iris Acquisition Application and Petition come within the exclusion from referral to the Executive Branch for national security, law enforcement, foreign policy and trade policy review and thus we did not refer them to the Agencies.98 The decision not to refer the LStar Equity Petition to the Agencies is contingent upon consummation of the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction 92 47 CFR  1.5001, 1.5004. Section 1.5004a1 states that a 100 percent aggregate allowance is subject to the requirement that the licensee seek and obtain Commission approval before any foreign individual, entity, or group not previously approved acquires, directly andor indirectly, more than 5 percent of the U.S. parents outstanding capital stock equity andor voting stock, or a controlling interest, with the exception of any foreign individual, entity, or group that acquires an equity andor voting interest of 10 percent or less, provided that the interest is exempt under  1.5001i3. 47 CFR  1.5004. 93 47 CFR  1.5002-1.5003. 94 47 CFR  1.5004, note to paragraph a. 95 See Process Reform for Executive Branch Review of Certain FCC Applications and Petitions Involving Foreign Ownership, IB Docket 16-155, Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd 10927, 10936, para. 24 2020 Executive Branch Review Process Order 47 CFR  1.40001a1. 96 Although we did not formally refer the Applications and Petitions, per standard practice, we provided a courtesy copy of the public notices to the Agencies.

If the GI DI Iris Acquisition Applicants and Petitioners do not file a consummation notice within that time frame, the grant of the LStar Application and Petition as well as the GI DI Iris Acquisition Application and Petition shall be rescinded and will be null and void, and consistent with its regular practice, the Commission will refer the LStar Equity Application and Petition to the Agencies.99 We also retain authority to pursue enforcement action by the Commission for non-compliance with the Act or the Commissions rules. Grant of Applications and Petitions for Declaratory Ruling We find, upon consideration of the record, that granting the domestic section 214 applications for the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction and the previous LStar Equity Transaction, which was consummated in 2018, will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity,100 and will not impact the Domestic 214 Authorization Holders ability to meet RBE service, performance, and reporting obligations.101 The GI DI Iris Acquisition Applicants remain obligated to comply with all applicable RBE requirements,102 including offering voice services on a common carrier basis in each RBE-supported area.103 We also find that the public interest would not be served by prohibiting the foreign ownership of JAB Wireless, the controlling U.S. parent related to the LStar Equity Petition, and the post-transaction foreign ownership of JAB Wireless related to the GI DI Iris Acquisition Petition in excess of the 25 benchmarks in section 310b4 of the Act. The LStar Equity Application and Petition and the GI DI Iris Acquisition Application and Petition, are granted as set out in this Public Notice. Grant of the LStar Application and Petition as well as grant of the GI DI Iris Acquisition Application and Petition are conditioned on the consummation of the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction within fifteen 15 days of release of this Public Notice and the GI DI Iris Acquisition Applicants filing the consummation notice within three 3 days after consummation. A failure to comply with this condition will result in the recission of the grants which will be considered null and void. Further, grant of the LStar Application and Petition and grant of the GI DI Iris Acquisition Application and Petition are without prejudice to any enforcement action by the Commission for non- compliance with the Act or the Commissions rules and without prejudice to Commission action on other related, pending applications or petitions.

INTRODUCTION 1. In this Order, we grant 37 appeals of decisions of the Universal Service Administrative Company USAC from E-Rate program participants seeking to correct ministerial or clerical errors associated with the invoicing process.1 We also grant one petition for reconsideration.2 The petitioners inadvertently made ministerial or clerical errors while completing their E-Rate request for reimbursement i.e., FCC Form 472 Billed Entity Applicant Reimbursement BEAR or FCC Form 474 Service Provider Invoice SPI form or while requesting an invoice filing deadline extension. While these mistakes caused the reimbursement forms or invoice filing deadline extensions to be rejected or unprocessed, all filings were timely submitted in compliance with section 54.514a and b of the Commissions rules.3 To the extent necessary, we also waive section 54.719b of the Commissions 1 See Appendix A. The E-Rate program is formally known as the schools and libraries universal service support mechanism. 2 We initially denied Wake County Public Schools request for review. See Streamlined Resolution of Requests Related to Actions by the Universal Service Administrative Company, CC Docket No. 02-6, WC Docket Nos. 02-60, 06-122, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 9927, 9936 WCB 2020. On reconsideration, Wake County Public Schools raises new facts demonstrating that we should grant the appeal. Section 1.106c2 of the Commissions rules provides that a petition for reconsideration of a decision may rely on facts not previously presented to the Commission if consideration of the facts relied on is required by the public interest. 47 C.F.R.  1.106c2. 3 47 CFR  54.514a and b requiring that invoices must be submitted to USAC 1 120 days after the last day to receive service 2 120 days after the date of the FCC Form 486 Notification Letter or 3 120 days after the date of a Revised Funding Commitment Decision Letter approving a post-commitment request made by the applicant or service provider or a successful appeal of a previously denied or reduced funding request, whichever is latest, and continued. 330 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-48 rules that requires applicants to seek review of a USAC decision from USAC in the first instance.4 We also grant seven appeals where the petitioners filed timely requests for reimbursement pursuant to section 54.514a and b of the Commissions rules, but were later denied funding because the petitioners failed to respond to USACs request for additional information regarding the submitted reimbursement form or extension request within the specified timeframe.5 II. BACKGROUND 2. Invoicing. E-Rate applicants select one of two ways to seek reimbursement of the costs of eligible E-Rate equipment and services.6 If an applicant pays the full cost of the equipment and services upfront, then the applicant must submit an FCC Form 472, the Billed Entity Applicant Reimbursement BEAR form, to request reimbursement for the discounted share of the costs from USAC.7 If an applicant only pays its service provider the non-discounted share of the cost of the eligible equipment and services, then the service provider must file an FCC Form 474, the Service Provider Invoice SPI form, to receive reimbursement of the discounted share of the costs directly from USAC. Before 2014, invoice filing deadline extension requests were governed by a USAC procedural rule that allowed applicants or service providers to request and receive a 120-day invoice extension under certain conditions.8 USAC routinely granted invoice extension requests that met its criteria, including requests made up to a year after the original invoice filing deadline. This allowed for the resubmission of invoices in cases where E-Rate participants made ministerial and clerical errors on their forms. In 2014, however, the Commission adopted a new E-Rate rule requiring applicants and service providers to submit invoicing forms for reimbursement to USAC no later than 120 days after the last day to receive service or 120 days after the date of the FCC Form 486 Notification letter, whichever is later.9 The Commissions rules also allow an applicant or a service provider to receive a one-time 120-day extension of the invoice filing deadline for any cause, if the applicant or service provider requests the extension before the applicable invoice filing deadline.10 The Commission further explained that waivers of these rules would generally Continued from previous page also requiring the invoice filing deadline extension to be submitted in advance of the invoice filing deadline set forth in paragraph a of this section. 4 47 CFR  1.3. 5 See Appendix B. 6 47 CFR  54.514c. 7 USAC Invoicing FCC From 472 Filing, httpswww.usac.orge-rateapplicant-processinvoicingfcc-form-472- filing last visited Jan. 19, 2023. 8 See, e.g., Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support Mechanism, CC Docket No. 02-6, Third Report and Order and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 18 FCC Rcd 26912, 26950, para. 93 2003 noting that USAC provides an extension of the deadline to file invoices under certain conditions, including 1 authorized service provider changes 2 authorized service substitutions 3 no timely notice to USAC e.g., the service providers Form 486 Notification Letter is returned to USAC as undeliverable 4 USAC errors that result in a late invoice 5 USAC delays in data entering a form that ultimately result in a late invoice 6 documentation requirements that necessitate third party contact or certification 7 natural or man-made disasters that prevent timely filing of invoices 8 good Samaritan BEARs and 9 circumstances beyond the service providers control. 9 47 CFR  54.514a 2014 Modernizing the E-Rate Program for Schools and Libraries, WC Docket No. 13-184, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 29 FCC Rcd 8870, 8965-66, paras. 238-39 2014 First 2014 E-Rate Order. In December 2020, the Commission amended section 54.514a of its rules and provided applicants and service providers 120 days after the date of Revised Funding Commitment Decision Letter approving a post-commitment request made by the applicant or service provider or successful appeal of a previously denied or reduced funding request to submit their requests for reimbursement. See Modernizing the E-Rate Program for Schools and Libraries, WC Docket No. 13-184, Order, 35 FCC Rcd 14426, 14429, para. 10 WCB Dec. 10, 2020 2020 E-Rate Invoice Rule Modification Order. 10 47 CFR  54.514b. 331 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-48 not be in the publics interest and directed the Wireline Competition Bureau Bureau to grant waivers only under extraordinary circumstances.11 3. AppealWaiver Rules. In 2014, the Commission also amended its rules to require parties seeking review of USAC decisions to first file an appeal with USAC.12 Prior to the modification of this rule, a party could appeal an action or decision by USAC directly to the Commission.13 Now, however, if USAC denies a timely-filed reimbursement form, the applicant or service provider must first appeal that decision to USAC, within the 60-day deadline set forth in section 54.720 of the Commissions rules.14 When appealing USACs invoicing-related decision, an applicant or service provider is not required to file another reimbursement form or seek a waiver of the invoice deadline.15 4. Ministerial and Clerical Errors. In the 2006 Bishop Perry Order, the Commission found good cause existed to grant petitioners appeals where the applicants made immaterial clerical, ministerial, or procedural errors in filling out their FCC Forms 470 and 471.16 The Commission waived the minimum processing standards established by USAC in these instances, noting there was no evidence of waste, fraud or abuse, misuse of funds, or a failure to adhere to core program requirements.17 The Commission also found that the denial of funding requests inflicted undue hardship on the applicants and that rigid compliance with the application procedures did not further the purposes of section 254h of the Communications Act Act, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, or serve the public interest.18 In that decision and subsequent orders, relief has been granted to E-Rate participants for many types of ministerial and clerical errors on the FCC Form 471 and related forms,19 defined as errors one would make when entering data from one list to another, such as mistyping a number, using the wrong name or phone number, failing to enter an item from the source list onto the application, or making an arithmetical error.20 In 2011, the Commission permitted applicants to correct ministerial and clerical 11 First 2014 E-Rate Order, 29 FCC Rcd at 8966, para. 240. 12 47 CFR  54.719a-b. See also First 2014 E-Rate Order, 29 FCC Rcd at 8970-71, paras. 250-52 revising sections 54.719 and 54.720 of the Commissions rules to, among other things, require parties seeking appeal of a USAC decision to first seek review with USAC. Parties seeking a waiver of the Commissions rules, however, must seek relief directly from the Commission. 47 CFR  54.719c. 13 See, e.g., 47 CFR  54.719 2013 allowing the party to file an appeal with USAC, or directly with the Commission. 14 47 CFR  54.720. 15 See USAC, Schools and Libraries Program News Brief Dec. 9, 2016, httpsapps.usac.orgsltoolsnews- briefspreview.aspx?id734. 16 Request for Review of the Decision of the Universal Service Administrator by Bishop Perry Middle School et al.

In the Ann Arbor Order, relief was granted for such mistakes as entering the wrong competitive bidding form number, entering the wrong billed entity number, entering the wrong name or service provider identification number SPIN, entering the wrong expiration date for a contract, wrongly continued. 332 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-48 errors on already-submitted FCC Forms 471 up until the date that the funding commitment decision letter is issued by USAC.21 The Commission explained that because of the complexity and detail involved in completing E-Rate forms and associated documentation, such errors may not be discovered until significantly after a request for funding was filed.22 The Bureau also expanded its relief for ministerial and clerical errors to the FCC Form 486 in instances where applicants submitted the form with the incorrect service start date, causing funding denials.23 These decisions noted that the minor mistakes at issue did not warrant the complete rejection of the FCC Forms 486 given that the applicants made a procedural error and did not violate a Commission rule.24 5. Late or Missing Information Requests. In addition to granting relief for ministerial and clerical errors, the Commission has also found that it is in the public interest to grant appeals in situations where E-Rate participants had funding reduced or denied because USAC-requested information was not submitted in the specified timeframe.25 The Commission determined that these appeals involved a procedural error on the part of the E-Rate participant, not a failure to adhere to a core program requirement or a misuse of funds.26 The Commission further found that these appeals involved a processing deadline, not a program rule. Although deadlines are necessary for the efficient administration of the E-Rate program, in these cases, the Commission found that the applicants had demonstrated that rigid adherence to such procedures did not further the purposes of section 254h of the Act, or serve the public interest.27 While these decisions involved USACs information requests in the context of the processing the FCC Form 471,28 information requests are also necessary for correctly processing E-Rate reimbursement forms i.e., FCC Forms 472 and 474. Here, USAC has denied timely-filed reimbursement forms when applicants or service providers failed to respond within seven days to Continued from previous page classifying the type of service recurring vs. non-recurring, making a calculation error, entering the monthly charge as the annual charge, entering the discounted annual price rather than the pre-discount annual price, and miscalculating the discount rate.

In the Bishop Perry Order, the Commission gave applicants 15 calendar days to submit corrections of clerical or ministerial errors, or to refile their FCC Form 470 or FCC Form 471 application, or associated documentation.

DISCUSSION 6. In this Order, we consider several appeals from E-Rate participants that timely submitted reimbursement forms or invoice filing deadline extension requests but were denied funding because of ministerial or clerical errors on the forms or extension requests.30 We also consider appeals from applicants and service providers that were denied funding because they did not respond to USACs information request regarding timely-filed reimbursement forms or extension requests within the specified timeframe. 7. Ministerial and Clerical Errors. The petitioners listed in Appendix A made ministerial or clerical errors when submitting their BEAR FCC Form 472 or SPI FCC Form 474 reimbursement forms when, for example, they inadvertently selected an incorrect last day of service from the invoice drop-down menu or otherwise entered a wrong billing, service or shipping date,31 inadvertently requested funding for the wrong funding year,32 entered the wrong service provider identification number,33 entered the wrong customer billed date on the SPI form,34 entered the wrong recipient of service on an invoice,35 or entered the wrong application or funding request number on the BEAR or SPI form.36 8. We also consider several appeals where the petitioners invoice filing deadline extension requests were denied or not processed because the requests contained ministerial or clerical errors.

We find that it is the public interest to grant the appeals included in Appendix A. The Commission may waive any provision of its rules on its own motion or on petition for good cause shown.39 A rule may be waived where particular facts make strict compliance inconsistent with the public interest.40 In addition, the Commission may take into account considerations of hardship, equity, or more effective implementation of overall policy on an individual basis.41 In sum, a waiver is appropriate if special circumstances warrant a deviation from the general rule, and such deviation would better serve the public interest than strict adherence to the general rule.42 10. The petitioners in Appendix A argue that immaterial clerical, ministerial or procedural errors caused the rejection or denial of their otherwise-timely reimbursement forms or extension requests. The petitioners mistakes on these forms and requests are nearly identical to those mistakes made in the context of FCC Forms 470, 471, 486, and other related forms or submissions for funding under the E- Rate program, discussed above, and we find that the same rationale for granting those requests applies here. Namely, we find that petitioners submitted timely reimbursement forms or requests for an invoice filing deadline extensions to USAC pursuant to section 54.514a and b of the Commissions rules.43 However, those forms or requests were rejected or denied by USAC for the types of ministerial and clerical errors that the Commission has previously determined should be reconsidered by USAC on other E-Rate forms and requests. We also find that the denial of funding inflicts undue hardship on the E-Rate participants and rigid compliance with the invoice filing deadline and invoice filing deadline extension rules does not further the purposes of section 254h or serve the public interest.44 In addition, we further find that there is no evidence of waste, fraud or abuse, misuse of funds, or a failure to adhere to core program requirements.45 11. While applicants must file waivers to extend the invoice filing with the Commission,46 USAC has the authority to accept evidence of a ministerial and clerical error on appeal and correct the issue on the submitted form or request. Most petitioners included in Appendix A, however, did not file an appeal with USAC based on the ministerial or clerical error found on their reimbursement form. Some petitioners said USAC directed them to refile their reimbursement form, resulting in a denial because the new reimbursement form was submitted after the invoice filing deadline set forth in 54.514a of the Commissions rules.47 Other petitioners filed a waiver directly with the Commission, either based on 37 Request for Waiver of Fall Mountain Regional School District Request for Waiver of The New America School - Las Cruces. 38 Request for Waiver of Southwest Plains Regional Service Center Bucklin USD 459 Request for Waiver of Columbia School District. 39 47 CFR  1.3. 40 See Northeast Cellular Telephone Co. v.

Haynes Charter School District Martin Luther King, Jr. Christian Academy Request continued. 335 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-48 their understanding of the rules or on the advice of USAC.48 Two petitioners appeal requests were denied because USAC treated them as waivers for the invoice filing deadline and dismissed the petitioners appeals because it did not have the authority to waive section 54.514a of the Commissions rules.49 One appeal was denied by USAC for being filed more than 60 days after the adverse decision, although the appeal was actually timely based on the date of the FCC Form 472 BEAR Notification Letter.50 One appeal was denied by USAC, even though the petitioner documented the invoices ministerial and clerical error in its appeal.51 To the extent petitioners filed an appeal with the Commission in the first instance, we also waive our rule that requires parties to first file an appeal with USAC and direct USAC to treat their appeals as timely filed.52 12. Based on the circumstances described by petitioners listed in Appendix A, we find good cause to waive our rules because of the substantial hardship and confusion caused by USACs invoice denials and incorrect guidance that applicants and service providers needed a waiver of the invoice filing deadline from the Commission before they could correct the clerical and ministerial errors on their reimbursement forms or extension requests. Thus, we waive section 54.719b of the Commissions rules for the petitioners that appealed to the Commission first. To the extent petitioners included in Appendix A also filed their appeals late, we further waive section 54.720 of our rules that require appeals be filed within 60 days from the date of the adverse decision.53 This is consistent with precedent where the Commission has waived the filing deadline when E-Rate participants had filed an appeal within 60 days of discovering or receiving notice of the ministerial or clerical error.54 13. Going forward, we direct USAC to review appeals of ministerial and clerical errors as described above and not to direct these petitioners to file waiver requests with the Commission.55 Continued from previous page for Waiver of Southeastern Services Inc.

We note that if a clerical or ministerial mistake of this type is discovered after the 60-day appeal-filing deadline,57 E-Rate participants should first file a waiver request with the Commission seeking a waiver of section 54.720 of the Commissions rules and explain how and when the clerical or ministerial error was discovered.58 14. Late or Missing Information Requests. We also find that it is in the public interest to grant the appeals included in Appendix B where petitioners did not respond in seven days to USACs request for information about a timely-filed reimbursement form or extension of the invoice filing deadline request. These petitioners did not meet the deadline to submit additional information concerning their form or request because they did not receive USACs request for additional information,59 or did not respond in a timely manner due to personnel issues.60 We find that the circumstances in these cases are nearly identical to those missing the deadline for responding to USAC information requests in the context of the FCC Form 471 applications, and the same rationale applies here. Namely, we find that these appeals involved a procedural error on the part of the E-Rate participant, not a failure to adhere to a core program requirement or a misuse of funds.61 Further, these appeals involve a processing deadline, and not a program rule. We find, as the Commission noted in the context of late or missing information when processing FCC Form 471 applications, that the petitioners have demonstrated that rigid adherence to such procedures does not further the purposes of section 254h of the Act or serve the public interest.62 15. We encourage applicants and service providers to invoice early and timely request a one- time 120-day invoice filing deadline extension if any issues arise or could arise regarding the invoice filing deadline set forth by section 54.514a-b of the Commissions rules. By building in additional time for the E-Rate invoicing process, problems caused by ministerial and clerical errors or missed information requests can be resolved with USAC, before the invoicing filing deadline expires without the 56 47 CFR  54.514 requiring that invoices be submitted either 120 days after the last day to receive service or 120 days after the date of the FCC Form 486 Notification Letter, whichever is later. See supra para. 2. 57 47 CFR  54.720. 58 47 CFR  54.719c noting that parties seeking waivers of the Commissions rules must seek relief directly from the Commission. The Commission has permitted waivers in certain instances where E-Rate participants have filed their appeals late. See, e.g., Requests for Review andor Waiver of Decisions of the Universal Service Administrator by ABC Unified School District et al. Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support Mechanism, CC Docket No. 02-6, Order, 26 FCC Rcd 11019, para. 2 WCB 2011 ABC Unified School District Order waiving the filing deadline for petitioners that submitted their appeals to the Commission or USAC only a few days late or submitted their appeals within a reasonable period after receiving actual notice of USAC's adverse decision. 59 Request for Waiver of All County Business Machines St. Raymond High School for Boys Request for Review of Marengo County Schools Request for Waiver of Moniteau School District Request for Waiver of PenTeleData Limited Partnership I Crestwood Area School District Request for Review of Vector Resources Inc. Los Angeles Unified School District. 60 Request for Waiver of Pinnacle Charter School. Consistent with precedent, we also find good cause exists to waive section 54.720a or b of the Commissions rules, which requires that petitioners file their appeals within 60 days of an adverse USAC decision, for Pinnacle Charter School. See, e.g., ABC Unified School District Order, 26 FCC Rcd at 11019, para. 2 waiving the filing deadline for petitioners that submitted their appeals to the Commission or USAC only a few days late. 61 Alpaugh Unified School District Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6037, para. 5. 62 Id. 337 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-48 need for the party to file an appeal or a waiver request. We remand the applications included in Appendices A and B to USAC and direct USAC to complete its review of the these requests consistent with this Order. In remanding these requests to USAC, we make no finding as to the merits of the petitioners requests. We also waive sections 54.507d and 54.514a of the Commissions rules and direct USAC to waive any procedural deadline that might be necessary to effectuate our ruling.63 IV. ORDERING CLAUSES 16.

Authorized bids included a range of performance tiers, with more than one-half of the winning bids at 10020 Mbps or higher. Additionally, 10 applicants were authorized to receive CAF Phase II auction support in conjunction with New Yorks New NY Broadband Program totaling 65.49 million in 10-year support, covering 47,200 locations in New York.1 All Auction 903 winning bids have been authorized or defaulted, with state-level summaries of authorizations posted under the Data tab on the Auction 903 webpage at httpswww.fcc.govauction903. The summary provides for each authorized Auction 903 long-form applicant 1 the total support amount over 10 years and total number of locations that the long-form applicant is authorized for in each state 2 the total number of locations to which the authorized support recipient must offer the required voice and broadband services for each performance tier and latency in each state and 3 the eligible census blocks included in the winning bids that are authorized in each state.2 As part of the Rural Broadband Accountability Plan,3 the Commission is also making available additional information from the long-form applications submitted by applicants FCC Form 683 and FCC Form 5625.

The Commission also required callers making such exempt calls to allow consumers to opt out of any future calls that they do not wish to receive.4 These rule changes resulted in modified information collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, which the Office of Management and Budget OMB approved on September 15, 2021.5 The Commission explained in the TCPA Exemptions Order that it would publish in the Federal Register a compliance date for the amended rules, which would be six months following the date of publication.6 1 Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act, Pub.

BACKGROUND 1. The Media Bureau Bureau has before it for comparative consideration a group of mutually exclusive MX applications for a new noncommercial educational NCE FM station construction permit.1 By this Memorandum Opinion and Order Order, the Bureau performs a threshold fair distribution of service analysis and identifies the tentative selectee in this group. Petitions to deny the application of this tentative selectee must be filed within 30 days of the date of release of this Order.2 2. The group addressed in this Order consists of applications that were filed in November 2021, during the filing window for new NCE FM applications.3 These applicants have had an opportunity to settle among themselves,4 and are now subject to a simplified, comparative process codified in Part 73, Subpart K, of the Commissions rules.5 During the first step of this process, the Bureau, acting pursuant to delegated authority,6 uses service area population data, Tribal Priority criteria, and certifications provided by the applicants to perform a threshold fair distribution analysis. 1 On November 29, 2021, the Bureau issued a public notice identifying 231 groups of mutually exclusive NCE FM applications. See Media Bureau Identifies Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications Submitted in the November 2021, Filing Window for New Noncommercial Educational Stations, MB Docket No. 20-343, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 16452 MB 2021 NCE MX Public Notice. The group analyzed herein was included on the NCE MX Public Notice. 2 See 47 CFR  73.7004b. 3 See Media Bureau Announces NCE FM New Station Application Filing Window Window Open from November 2, 2021, to November 9, 2021, MB Docket No. 20-343, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 7449 MB 2021.

See also 47 CFR  0.61 and 0.283. A Section 307b analysis is ordinarily conducted at the staff level because the Bureau has delegated authority to make Section 307b determinations. See Reexamination of Comparative Standards for Noncommercial Educational Applicants, Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd 7386, 7397 2000 NCE Order. In contrast, the point system analysis, which is conducted when Section 307b is not determinative, must be conducted by the Commission as this analysis is considered a simplified hearing for purposes of 47 U.S.C. 155c1.

Section 307b of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended Section 307b states that the Commission must provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of broadcast service among the states and communities.7 In accordance with this directive, the Commission considers the fair distribution of service as a first, or threshold, issue in its NCE FM comparative review process.8 Accordingly, when applicants in a mutually exclusive NCE FM group9 propose to serve different communities, the Bureau first performs a threshold fair distribution analysis to ascertain whether grant of any of the applications would best further the Section 307b objective.10 In the first step of the Section 307b, or fair distribution, analysis, the Bureau determines whether any of the applicants in the MX group is a federally recognized Native American Tribe or Alaska Native Village proposing to serve Tribal Lands11 and claims the Tribal Priority.12 4. If there is no Tribal Applicant in the MX group,13 the Bureau proceeds to the second step in the Section 307b analysis and determines whether any applicant would provide a first or second reserved band channel NCE aural service to a substantial population the First or Second NCE Service Preference and compares population coverage totals.14 Specifically, during this step, an NCE FM applicant is eligible to receive a fair distribution preference or Section 307b preference15 if it would provide a first or second reserved band channel NCE aural service to at least 10 of the population in the aggregate, within the proposed stations service area, provided that the population served is at least 2,000 people. If only one applicant in an MX group qualifies for the First or Second NCE Service 7 47 U.S.C.  307b. 8 See 47 CFR  73.7002 NCE Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7396 concluding that fair distribution of stations to communities should remain a threshold issue, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 16 FCC Rcd 5074, 5077 2001 NCE MOO when competing FM applications propose to serve different communities, a proposal would be considered best, as a threshold matter, if it would provide service to a significant unserved or underserved population. 9 Conflicting NCE FM applications, which cannot all be granted consistent with the Commission's technical rules, are considered mutually exclusive. An MX group consists of all applications which are MX to at least one other application in the group. 10 See 47 U.S.C.  307b In considering applications for licenses . . . when and insofar as there is demand for the same, the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among the several States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same. 47 CFR  73.7002a. Applicants Form 2100, Schedule 340, Fair Distribution of Service certifications enable the Bureau to consider whether service to one community over the other would best achieve the Commissions directive to distribute radio service fairly among communities. 11 See 47 CFR  73.7000, 73.7002b. 12 An NCE FM applicant is eligible to receive a fair distribution preference, and ultimately be awarded the construction permit, if it identifies itself as a Tribal Applicant, proposes Tribal Coverage, and proposes the first reserved channel NCE service owned by any Tribal Applicant at a community of license located on Tribal Lands the Tribal Priority. See 47 CFR  73.7000 defining a Tribal Applicant and Tribal Coverage see also 47 CFR  73.7002b Policies to Promote Rural Radio Service and to Streamline Allotment and Assignment Procedures, First Report and Order, 25 FCC Rcd 1583 2010 establishing the Section 307b Tribal Priority. 13 The MX group addressed in this Order does not contain a Tribal Applicant. Accordingly, the first step of the Section 307b analysis, the Tribal Priority analysis, is unnecessary herein. 14 See 47 CFR  73.7002b. 15 The terms fair distribution preference and Section 307b preference are used interchangeably to refer to the preference given to an MX application that is deemed to substantially further the fair distribution of service goals enunciated in Section 307b of the Act. 385 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-59 Preference, its fair distribution Section 307b preference is dispositive,16 and the applicant will be awarded the construction permit. 5. If more than one applicant in the MX group claims a First or Second NCE Service Preference, the applicant proposing to provide the greatest number of people with the highest level of service will be awarded a construction permit, if it will provide such service to at least 10 of the people within the station's 60 dBu contour and to at least 5,000 more people than the next best applicant.17 First service will be preferred over second service.18 Accordingly, the Bureau first examines the applicants' first service levels alone to determine whether one of the proposals is superior and should receive a decisive preference. If such applicants are equivalent with respect to first service, or no applicant qualifies for a first service preference, the Bureau considers combined first and second NCE aural service population totals. At each stage of the Section 307b analysis, any applicant that is comparatively disfavored in terms of Section 307b eligibility or service totals is eliminated. The process ends when the Bureau determines that one applicant is entitled to a Section 307b preference, or that either 1 none of the remaining applicants can be selected or eliminated based on a Section 307b preference, or 2 each remaining applicant proposes to serve the same community. Any remaining MX applicants proposing equivalent service overall, or proposing the same community, proceed to a point system analysis.19 6. Each applicant claiming a First or Second NCE Service preference must support its fair distribution claim with an exhibit identifying the population residing within the proposed stations 60 dB service contour and the number of people that would receive a new first or second NCE aural service.20 Further, any applicant which receives a decisive Section 307b preference is required to construct and operate technical facilities substantially as proposed, and cannot downgrade service to the area on which the preference was based for a period of four years of on-air operations.21 III. GROUP ANALYSIS 7. This Section contains a narrative description of our analysis. Unless otherwise noted, each component of the analysis is based on information provided by each of the respective applicants.22 16 As noted, in the case of an MX group with a Tribal Applicant, an applicant qualifying for a Tribal Priority, however, will prevail over any MX applicant claiming a First or Second NCE Service Preference. 17 47 CFR  73.7002b. 18 Id. 19 See 47 CFR 73.7003 point system selection procedures. 20 See id.  73.7002b. Applicants were required to use the most recently available, i.e., 2010 Census, population data. See Media Bureau Announces NCE FM New Station Filing Procedures and Requirements for November 2-9, 2021, Window, DA 21-885, at 5-7 and n.24 MB rel. July 23, 2021 NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice FCC Form 2100, Schedule 340, Instructions for Fair Distribution of Service at 12-14. An applicants fair distribution showing must be computed as of the time of filing close of the filing window for applications filed prior to the window and cannot be enhanced thereafter. See 47 CFR  73.7003e and f3 NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice at 11 NCE MOO, 16 FCC Rcd at 5082-83. However, an applicant that subsequently makes engineering changes that would diminish its fair distribution position must amend its application to reflect that diminished position. See 47 CFR  1.65 and 73.7003e. 21 See 47 CFR  73.7005b see also 47 CFR  73.7002c. During this period, such applicant may make minor modifications to its authorized facilities, provided that i the modification does not downgrade service to the area on which the preference was based, or ii any potential loss of first and second NCE service is offset by at least equal first and, separately, combined first and second NCE service population gains, and the applicant would continue to qualify for a decisive Section 307b preference.. Id. 22 See FCC Form 2100, Schedule 340, Noncommercial Educational Station for Reserved Channel Construction Permit Application, Fair Distribution of Service certifications. An applicant responding Yes to any of the certification questions was required to submit an attachment with a justification for its certification. 386 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-59 8. Group 59B.23 This group consists of six applications to serve different communities in Florida and Georgia. In Florida, Faith and Action Community Outreach, Inc. Faith proposes to serve Madison, and Big Bend Heritage Music Association, Inc. Big Bend proposes to serve Perry. In Georgia, Elijah Radio Elijah proposes to serve Dasher Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission GPTC proposes to serve Pelham Church Planters of America Church Planters proposes to serve Quitman and Bemiss Road Baptist Church and Lowndes County Christian Academy Inc. Bemiss proposes to serve Valdosta. 9. Group 59B originally included two additional applicants, CSN International CSN and Inverse Focus Ministry, Inc. Inverse. The Bureau initially performed a fair distribution analysis of the eight applications and identified Inverse as the tentative selectee in Group 59B.24 Inverse and CSN, however, subsequently requested dismissal of their applications.25 Accordingly, the Bureau conducted a second 307b analysis and identified Big Bend as the new tentative selectee of this group.26 However, Big Bend subsequently filed an amendment to its application in which it revised its population data and certified that it was not eligible for a fair distribution preference.27 Accordingly, we will perform a third fair distribution analysis of this group. 10. Elijah and GPTC each claims that it is eligible for a fair distribution preference based on combined first and second NCE population totals.28 The other applicants do not. Accordingly, Big Bend, Faith, Church Planters, and Bemiss are each eliminated. Elijah would provide a combined first and second NCE service to 12,723 people and GPTC to 6,971 people. Because Elijahs proposed combined first and second NCE service exceeds GPTCs proposal by at least 5,000 people, GPTC is eliminated. Elijah is the tentative selectee for Group 59B. IV. ADDITIONAL MATTERS 11. Acceptability Studies. Once the Bureau identifies a tentative selectee pursuant to the fair distribution analysis, the next step is to consider whether the selectees application has defects.29 If 23 Group 59, which originally contained 17 applications, was bifurcated as a result of a technical amendment. The other applications in the MX group were evaluated as Group 59A in a previous order. See Comparative Consideration of 27 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, FCC 22-61, at paras. 32-34 2022. 24 See Threshold Fair Distribution Analysis of 13 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 22-477 at 4-5, para. 11 MB May 2, 2022. 25 See File Nos. 167809 and 167493. 26 Threshold Fair Distribution Analysis of 5 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 22-1166, at 4-5, para. 10 MB Nov. 9, 2022. 27 See File No. 166291, Fair Distribution of Service Section and Attach. Perry 210 Amendment Purpose.pdf filed Dec. 7, 2022. 28 See File Nos. 167410 and 167018, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits. Elijahs 60 dBu contour encompasses 101,868 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 12,723 people. GPTCs 60 dBu contour encompasses 19,136 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 6,971 people. Thus, each would provide combined first and second NCE service to at least 10 percent of the population within its respective 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people. 29 If a tentative selectees application is found unacceptable for filing, it is dismissed. The applicant then has one opportunity to submit a curative amendment and a petition for reconsideration requesting reinstatement nunc pro tunc within 30 days, provided that the amendment is minor and does not alter the fair distribution analysis. See 47 CFR  73.3522b1. A tentative selectee that is unable to cure the defect is disqualified. 47 CFR  73.7004d. 387 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-59 the Bureau finds the application acceptable for filing, we announce acceptance by the release of this Order, and petitions to deny may be filed within 30 days following the release date of the Order.30 12. The Bureau has studied the application of the tentative selectee identified herein and determined that the application is acceptable for filing. The tentative selectee identified in this Order appears to be fully qualified to become the licensee of the new NCE FM station it has proposed. We tentatively conclude that the grant of the application would serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. It is our intention to grant the application if, after the 30-day petition to deny period has run, there is no substantial and material question concerning the grantability of the tentative selectees application. Such determinations of grantability may, of course, involve additional matters that may impact the timing or outcome of a decision. For example, a proposal to serve an area near the United States border with Canada or Mexico cannot become ripe for grant prior to the successful completion of international coordination. V. ORDERING CLAUSES 13. Group 59B. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, that the tentative selection of the application of Big Bend Heritage Music Association, Inc. File No. 166291, for authority to construct a new noncommercial educational FM station at Perry, Georgia, IS RESCINDED. 14. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Application filed by Elijah Radio File No. 167410 is TENTATIVELY SELECTED to be awarded a construction permit for a new NCE FM station in Dasher, Georgia and its application IS ACCEPTED FOR FILING, establishing a deadline thirty 30 days hereafter for the filing of petitions to deny. If, after the petition to deny period has run, the Bureau finds on the basis of the application, the pleadings filed, or other matters which it may officially notice that there is no substantial and material question concerning the grantability of the tentative selectees application, and it is determined that grant of the application serves the public interest, we intend, by public notice, TO DISMISS the mutually exclusive applications of Big Bend Heritage Music Association, Inc. File No. 166291, Faith and Action Community Outreach, Inc.

CCVESA filed the Application during the November 2021 filing window for new NCE FM applications.6 The Bureau determined that the Application was mutually exclusive with another application filed by CCVESA,7 and an application filed by TPR,8 and designated the three applications NCE MX Group 196.9 The Bureau later determined that the Application was entitled to a fair distribution preference, and designated it the tentative selectee of NCE MX Group 196.10 TPR timely filed the Petition. Among other things, TPR asserts that Application should be dismissed because CCVESA failed to provide a proper site assurance exhibit.11 TPR notes that the Application lists a tower owned by American Tower Corporation ATC but includes contact information for an officer of Vertical Bridge REIT, LLC, a different tower company.12 To date, CCVESA has not opposed the Petition or amended the CCVESA-Shiner Application to correct the contact information provided. However, it has responded to an LOI we sent, which requested information regarding whether, at the time it filed the Application, CCVESA had reasonable assurance that the site specified in the Application was available to it.13 In the LOI Response, CCVESA indicated that it had not contacted ATC directly but understood that Cody Peters at ATC had been contacted.14 While the LOI requested all documents  in the possession of CCVESA and its agents related to the availability of the proposed site, CCVESA submitted no documentation with its LOI Response. 3 Pleading File No. 204985 filed Dec. 9, 2022 Petition. 4 Letter from Dan J.

TPR also alleges that 1 the Application should not have been awarded a fair distribution preference, and 2 CCVESA underreported its existing authorizations in the Application. Id. at 5-6. Given our dismissal of the Application on site availability grounds, we need not and do not reach TPRs other allegations. 12 Id. at 3. 13 Letter from Albert Shuldiner, Chief, Audio Division, to Martin Guevara, Centro Cristiano de Vida Eterna San Antonio, Application File No. 166134 dated Nov. 23, 2021. 14 LOI Response at 1-2. 390 Discussion. We conclude that the CCVESA-Shiner Application is defective. As TPR notes,15 because the Application specified a site owned by ATC, CCVESA was required to specify the name of the person contacted about the site, the persons telephone number, and the persons status i.e. owner, agent or authorized representative. CCVESA submitted information regarding an individual employed by an unrelated tower company.16 To date, CCVESA has not amended the Application to correct this error. We also find that, based on the record before us, CCVESA lacked reasonable assurance that the site specified in the Application was available at the time it filed the Application. CCVESA has not submitted any evidence that it obtained reasonable assurance of the availability of the site specified in the Application. This site availability defect is non-curable and renders the Application subject to dismissal without an opportunity to amend.17 Accordingly, we grant the Petition, rescind our initial tentative selection of the Application, and dismiss the Application. In light of this finding, we conduct a new fair distribution analysis. The remaining two applications in NCE MX Group 196 propose service to different communities in Texas. Texas Public Radio proposes to serve Gonzales. CCVESA proposes to serve Runge CCVESA-Runge. Each applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference based on first NCE service population totals.18 TPR claims to provide new first NCE service to 4,175 people, and CCVESA-Runge claims to provide new first NCE service to 3,724 people. The proposals are comparable because neither exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people.19 Therefore, we consider combined first and second NCE service population totals. TPR would provide a first or second NCE service to 16,542 people, and CCVESA-Runge would provide a first or second NCE service to 18,675 people.20 Because these proposals are also comparable, the fair distribution analysis ends here. Accordingly, because we are unable to designate a tentative selectee under a section 307b fair distribution analysis, TPR and CCVESA-Runge will proceed to a point system analysis. The point system analysis, which is conducted when section 307b is not determinative, must be conducted by the Commission, as this analysis is considered a simplified hearing for purposes of section 155c1 of the Act.21 Accordingly we have referred the matter to the Commission to make a determination under a point system analysis.22 15 Petition at 4. 16 Application at Vertical Bridge Tower Contact Attach. 17 See Able Radio Corp., Letter Order, 26 FCC Rcd 16161, 16163 MB 2011 Radio Delaware, Inc., Memorandum Opinion and Order, 4 FCC Rcd 8630, 8631, paras. 9-11 Rev. Bd. 1989. 18 See Application File Nos. 166683 and 167130, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits. TPR claims that it would provide first NCE service to 4,175 of the 17,649 people encompassed within its 60 dBu contour.. CCVESA-Runge claims that it would provide first NCE service to 3,724 of the 18,675 people within its 60 dBu contour. Thus, each applicant would provide first NCE service to at least 10 of the population within its respective 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people. 19 The applicant proposing to provide service to the greatest number of people will only be awarded a construction permit if it will provide such service to at least 10 of the people within the station's 60 dBu contour and to at least 5,000 more people than the next best applicant. See 47 CFR  73.7002b. 20 See Application File Nos. 166683 and 167130, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits. 21 See 47 CFR  73.7002b see also NCE Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7420. 22 See Central Florida Educational Foundation, Inc. co Joseph E. Dunne, Esq., Letter Order, 22 FCC Rcd. 18332, 18334 MB 2007 referring the matter to the Commission for consideration where the initial outcome would be 391 Ordering Clauses. For the reasons discussed above, IT IS ORDERED that the Petition to Deny Pleading File No. 204985 filed by Texas Public Radio on December 9, 2022, IS GRANTED. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that the tentative selection of the application of Centro Cristiano de Vida Eterna San Antonio File No. 167134 for authority to construct a new noncommercial educational FM station at Shineer, Texas, IS RESCINDED and the application IS DISMISSED.

In this Order, we adopt the attached Consent Decree entered into by the Media Bureau Bureau and Associated Students of St. Marys College Licensee, licensee of Station KSMCFM, Moraga, California Station. The Consent Decree resolves issues arising from the Bureaus review of the captioned license renewal application Application for the Station. In particular, the Consent Decree resolves the Bureaus investigation of Licensees compliance with the Filing Deadline Rule and the Online Public Inspection File Rule contained in sections 73.3539a, 73.3527b2i, and 73.561a of the Commissions rules Rules.1 The Bureaus Audio Division suspended processing of the Application because Licensee did not comply with its renewal application filing deadline and public file obligations. 2. The Licensee has shown that, at the time of the violations, the Station was a student-run noncommercial educational NCE station licensed to an educational institution and that the violations at the Station are first-time documentation violations within the parameters of our policy concerning violations of documentation requirements of Rules by student-run NCE radio stations.2 The Bureau and Licensee have negotiated the attached Consent Decree in which Licensee stipulates that it violated sections 73.3539a and 73.3527b2i of the Rules. Pursuant to the Consent Decree, Licensee agrees, among other things, to make a civil penalty payment to the United States Treasury in the amount of 500, implement a comprehensive compliance plan to ensure future compliance with its online public inspection file obligations and timely filing of renewal applications, and, one year after entering into the Consent Decree, submit a compliance report to the Audio Division.3 1 See 47 CFR  73.3539a, 73.3527b2i, 73.561a. 2 See William Penn University, Policy Statement and Order, 28 FCC Rcd 6932, 6932, para. 2 MB 2013 in cases of first-time violations of certain documentation requirements of our Rules by student-run NCE radio stations . . . instead of issuing a Notice of Apparent Liability NAL, the Bureau will first afford the licensee an opportunity to negotiate a consent decree in which the licensee agree to a compliance plan and makes a voluntary contribution to the United States Treasury. In negotiating the amount of the voluntary contribution, the Bureau will consider the totality of circumstances, including giving appropriate consideration to the stations finances with respect to reducing the base forfeiture amount significantly.. 3 License disclosed in the Application that the Station was silent for two periods without authorization from February 2020 until August 20, 2020, and from September 10, 2021, to December 10, 2021. Licensee explains that first period of silence was initially because of a broken antenna, but the silence was extended because it was partially attributable to COVID-19 related closures, while the second period of silence was due to concerns over RF safety levels. We will not take any action for the first period of silence without STA was in part due to the COVID- 393 __________________________Federal Communications Commission DA 23-61 3. After reviewing the terms of the Consent Decree, we find that the public interest will be served by its approval and by terminating all pending proceedings relating to the Bureaus consideration of potential violations of the Rules. 4. Based on the record before us, we conclude that nothing in that record creates a substantial and material question of fact as to whether Licensee possesses the basic qualifications to remain a Commission licensee. 5. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to sections 4i, 4j, and 503b of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,4 and by the authority delegated by sections 0.61 and 0.283 of the Rules,5 the Consent Decree attached hereto IS ADOPTED without change, addition, or modification. 6.

II. BACKGROUND 3. Section 73.3539a of the Rules requires that applications for renewal of license for broadcast stations must be filed not later than the first day of the fourth full calendar month prior to the expiration date of the license sought to be renewed.2 An application for renewal of the Stations license should have been filed by August 1, 2021, the first full business day following the first day of the fourth full calendar month prior to the Stations license expiration date of December 1, 2021. The Stations Application was not filed until December 1, 2021, the day the Stations license expired. 4. Section 73.3527b2i requires radio station licensees to maintain an online public inspection file and to upload certain documents to the Commissions public inspection file database throughout the year.3 This includes among other requirements, the requirement that quarterly issues and programs lists be uploaded to the stations online public inspection file no later than the tenth day after each quarter. It is crucial that stations maintain online public inspection files that are complete and up to date because the information in them directly affects, among other things, the publics ability to be informed about a stations compliance with its obligations. 5. The Licensee recently filed the Application to renew its radio station license. We have determined that the Licensee did not comply with either the Filing Deadline Rule or the Online Public Inspection File Rule. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 3 above, the Licensee failed to file the Application by August 1, 2021, and the Licensee failed to place any issues and programs lists in its online public file as required by the Online Public Inspection File Rule prior to April 11, 2022. Based on the Licensees failure to comply with the Filing Deadline Rule and the Online Public Inspection File Rule, the Bureau commenced the Investigation and suspended processing the Application. 6. The Bureau and Licensee have negotiated the terms of the Consent Decree that terminates the Investigation into the matters discussed above. As part of the Consent Decree, the Licensee has agreed to make a settlement payment of Five Hundred Dollars 500 to the U.S. Treasury, and to implement and maintain a Compliance Plan designed to ensure its future compliance with the Rules noted above for one 1 year after the Effective Date. 2 47 CFR  73.3539a. 3 47 CFR  73.3527b2i. 396 __________________________Federal Communications Commission DA 23-61 III.

INTRODUCTION 1. In this declaratory ruling, we apply Commission precedent to ensure that millions of Americans can receive the information they need to maintain enrollment in Medicaid and other governmental health care programs to avoid losing health care coverage. Specifically, we grant in significant part the request of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HHS to confirm that federal and state governmental agencies working in conjunction with local governments, governmental contractors, and managed care entities acting under contract with state governments may, under certain circumstances, make autodialed and prerecorded or artificial voice calls or send autodialed text messages to raise awareness of the eligibility and enrollment requirements for these governmental health care programs without violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act TCPA.1 We also outline other ways HHS and its partners can reach consumers without running afoul of the restrictions of the TCPA. 2. The federal health care policies implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic changed the eligibility requirements for Medicaid and other governmental health care programs. Those changes have resulted in a substantial increase in participation in these programs.2 When the governments continuous enrollment requirement, which ensures that individuals enrolled in Medicaid throughout the pandemic are not at risk of losing coverage, comes to an end, millions of Americans will need to complete renewals necessary to redetermine their eligibility to remain in the program, a process complicated by staff shortages at state agencies that administer the Medicaid program.3 In this declaratory ruling, we help eligible consumers avoid coverage losses by confirming that federal and state governmental agencies and their contractual partners can communicate via automated calls and text 1 See Letter from Xavier Becerra, Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to Jessica Rosenworcel, Chairwoman, FCC April 28, 2022 filed in CG Docket No. 02-278 noting that millions of Americans will lose their Medicaid coverage when the public health emergency ends unless they take steps to renew eligibility HHS Letter. We treat the letter as a petition for declaratory ruling. See 47 CFR  1.2. 2 HHS Letter at 2 noting that these programs provide health coverage to 86 million Americans and that enrollment has increased 20 since the start of the public health emergency. 3 See Amy Goldstein, Millions of vulnerable Americans likely to fall off Medicaid once the federal public health emergency ends, Washington Post March 14, 2022 indicating that as many as 16 million low-income Americans risk losing Medicaid coverage, www.washingtonpost.comhealth20220314medicaid-loss-of-coverage. 404 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62 messages or prerecorded voice message calls with program enrollees about the steps necessary to retain enrollment in these health care programs. II. BACKGROUND A. TCPA 3. The TCPA generally requires any person making certain calls to obtain the recipients prior express consent before making the call absent an emergency purpose.4 In relevant part, the TCPAs restrictions apply to robocalls made 1 using an automatic telephone dialing system or artificial or prerecorded voice to a wireless phone5 and 2 using an artificial or prerecorded voice to a residential telephone line.6 The prohibition on using an autodialer to call a wireless number also applies to text messages sent using an autodialer.7 If a robocall includes or introduces an advertisement or constitutes telemarketing, consent generally must be in writing, after the caller makes certain disclosures i.e., prior express written consent.8 And the Commission has made clear that a consumer simply providing their telephone number constitutes their prior express consent to be contacted at that number regarding information closely related to the purpose for which they provided the number, absent instructions to the contrary.9 4. Separately, the Commission has clarified that federal and state governments making calls in the conduct of official business do not fall within the meaning of person in section 227b1.10 As a 4 See 47 U.S.C.  227b1. 5 See 47 U.S.C.  227b1A 47 CFR  64.1200a1-2. See Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid, 141 S.Ct. 1163, 1168- 73 2021 holding that to qualify as an automatic telephone dialing system under the TCPA, a device must have the capacity either to store a telephone number using a random or sequential number generator, or to produce a telephone number using a random or sequential number generator. 6 47 U.S.C.  227b1B 47 CFR  64.1200a3. The Commission has exempted from this prohibition artificial and prerecorded voice calls to residential telephone lines that are not made for a commercial purpose and calls made for a commercial purpose that do not contain an unsolicited advertisement or constitute telemarketing. See Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CC Docket No. 92-90, Report and Order, 7 FCC Rcd 8752, 8773-74, paras. 40-41 1992 1992 TCPA Order noting that artificial or prerecorded voice messages that do not seek to sell a product or service do not tread heavily upon the consumer interests implicated by the TCPA. 7 See Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CG Docket No. 02-278, Report and Order, 18 FCC Rcd 14014, 14115, para. 165 2003 2003 TCPA Order see also Satterfield v. Simon  Schuster, Inc., 569 F.3d 946 9th Cir. 2009 noting that text messaging is a form of communication used primarily between telephones and is therefore consistent with the definition of a call. 8 See 47 CFR  64.1200a2-3, b, f9 defining prior express written consent. 9 See 1992 TCPA Order, 7 FCC Rcd at 8769, para. 31. In the ACA Declaratory Ruling, for example, the Commission clarified that a party who provides his or her wireless number to a creditor as part of a credit application reasonably evidences prior express consent by the cell phone subscriber to be contacted at the number regarding the debt.

On the other hand, contractors making calls on behalf of such governments, along with local governmental entities and their contractors, are persons subject to the TCPA, except in those cases where the federal or state government is so involved in placing the call as to be deemed to have initiated it.11 B. HHS Letter 5. On April 28, 2022, HHS filed a letter requesting clarification that automated calls and texts or prerecorded telephone calls made to encourage individuals to renew enrollment with their state Medicaid program, Childrens Health Insurance Program CHIP, Basic Health Program BHP, or Health Insurance Marketplace Marketplace are permissible under the TCPA.12 HHS notes that the continuous enrollment requirement in Medicaid imposed by the public health emergency extends through the end of the month in which the public health emergency ends, and state agencies may begin to terminate coverage for ineligible individuals at that time.13 HHS indicates that millions of vulnerable Americans risk losing Medicaid coverage when the public health emergency relating to the COVID-19 pandemic ends.14 HHS contends that these coverage losses can be avoided if state governmental agencies and their partners are able to communicate via automated calls and text messages or prerecorded voice messages with enrollees about the steps required to retain their enrollment in these health coverage programs.15 6. HHS notes that many state agencies and their partners, including local governments, contractors, and managed care entities under contract with state agencies, are considering the use of robocalls and robotexts to remind enrollees to respond to requests from Medicaid agencies to renew their enrollment during three phases of this process.16 During the first phase, all Medicaid enrollees, along with CHIP and BHP enrollees whose most recent renewal has been delayed due to the public health emergency, may receive text messages or prerecorded calls reminding them to contact their program to affirmative showing of statutory intent to the contrary 2016 Broadnet Declaratory Ruling Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Broadnet Teleservices LLC Petition for Declaratory Ruling, National Consumer Law Center Petition for Reconsideration and Stay, Professional Services Council Petition for Reconsideration, CG Docket No. 02-278, Order on Reconsideration, 35 FCC Rcd 15052, 15059-61, paras. 22-26 2020 clarifying that state government callers in the conduct of official business do not fall within the meaning of person in section 227b1 2020 Broadnet Order. 11 See, e.g., 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 15059, paras. 18-21 concluding that governmental callers rather than a contractor were the maker of the call because the governmental entity made all decisions regarding whether to make a call, the timing of the call, the call recipients, and the content of the call. The Commission noted that determining whether a governmental entity or its contractor is the maker of the call is a highly fact-specific, case-by- case inquiry. See id. at 15059, paras. 19-20. 12 See HHS Letter at 1. 13 Id. at 5. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, Pub. L. No. 116-127, made increasing federal matching funds available for state Medicaid programs that meet specific requirements, including that they maintain the enrollment of most Medicaid enrollees through the end of the month in which the public health emergency ends. On December 29, 2022, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act that decoupled the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision from the public health emergency and terminates this provision on March 31, 2023. As a result, states can resume Medicaid disenrollments beginning April 1, 2023. States are required to maintain updated contact information, and make attempts to contact enrollees prior to disenrollment in Medicaid. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328 2022. 14 HHS Letter at 2 citing an Urban Institute projection that 15.8 million people are at risk of losing Medicaid coverage. 15 Id. at 3, 6 noting that local governments play a critical role and often conduct determinations of Medicaid and CHIP eligibility and managed care facilities under contract with a state serve as important messengers on behalf of the state. 16 Id. at 3. 406 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62 ensure their contact information is up to date.17 In the second phase, when renewals are being processed for Medicaid enrollees, along with regular annual renewals for CHIP and BHP enrollees, some individuals will need to provide additional information, such as updated income information to complete the redetermination of eligibility.18 These individuals may receive text messages or prerecorded calls reminding them to respond to their program.19 If they do not respond, these individuals may receive another reminder.20 7. Lastly, in the event a determination is made that an individual is no longer eligible for the program for which they have enrolled, during the final phase, the individual may receive text messages or prerecorded calls explaining the actions that they can take to enroll in another health coverage program.21 HHS indicates that no more than six to eight individual calls or messages will be made to any individual enrollee22 once an enrollee has responded with the requested information, or has enrolled in another health care coverage program, the individual should not receive any additional calls or text messages.23 8. HHS offers two reasons supporting its request. First, HHS contends that a consumer providing their telephone number when applying for a governmental health care program constitutes prior express consent to be contacted at that telephone number regarding eligibility for and ongoing enrollment in the program.24 Second, HHS urges that, because federal and state agencies are so involved in placing these calls by determining the content, timing, and recipient of the call or text message, the federal or state government is the maker of the call under the TCPA even if a third party is involved.25 9. On May 3, 2022, the Commission released a Public Notice seeking comments on the issues raised in the HHS Letter.26 A wide variety of commenters including non-profit organizations, governmental entities, health insurance providers, and consumer groups expressed support for HHS requested clarification.27 In general, these commenters reiterate that millions of the most vulnerable Americans risk losing important health care benefits when the public health emergency comes to an end.28 These commenters indicate that the use of autodialed calls and text messages are highly effective in reaching the most vulnerable groups such as low-income, elderly, and non-English speaking individuals with the information that they require to maintain these health care benefits.29 Although in agreement 17 Id. at 4. 18 Id. 19 Id. 20 Id. 21 Id. at 4-5. 22 Id. at 5. 23 Id. 24 Id. at 8. 25 Id. at 8-9 noting that the Commission has clarified that federal and state governmental callers are not considered persons that are subject to the TCPA. 26 See Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau Seeks Comment on Request Relating to Enrollment in Medicaid and Other Governmental Health Coverage Programs, CG Docket No. 02-278, Public Notice DA 22-487 May 3, 2022. 27 See, e.g., Blue Cross Comments at 1 California DHCS Comments at 2-4 CareFirst Comments at 1 Colorado HCPF Comments at 1-2 MassHealth Comments at 1 NCLC et al. Comments at 2 TennCare Comments at 1 Wisconsin DHS Comments at 1. 28 See, e.g., CBPP Comments at 1 LeadingAge Comments at 2 MACPAC Comments at 2 NYS Comments at 2. 29 See, e.g., AAPCHO Comments at 1 noting the importance of autodialed calls and text messages to reach Asian Americans Community Catalyst Comments at 2 importance of text messages in reaching low-income individuals LeadingAge Comments at 1 importance in contacting older individuals. 407 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62 with HHS that the provision of a telephone number upon application for a governmental health care program constitutes prior express consent under existing Commission precedent, NCLC suggests that the better grounds for relief when such telephone numbers have been reassigned to other users is a free-to- end-user exemption rather than deeming the federal or state government the maker of the call.30 Two commenters express concerns that granting HHS request will result in an increased number of unwanted robocalls absent limitations to avoid abuse.31 III. DISCUSSION 10. A critical component of the nations efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic is the ability of governmental agencies to communicate effectively with the public.32 As states resume routine renewals and other eligibility actions relating to governmental health care programs, their ability to communicate with Medicaid, CHIP, and BHP enrollees will be critical to successful retention of health care coverage for eligible enrollees. 11. In this declaratory ruling, we confirm that enrollees provision of a telephone number on an application for coverage in Medicaid or other government health care programs constitutes prior express consent to be contacted at that number regarding enrollment eligibility and the other reasons HHS describes in its petition because the purpose of those calls and texts is closely related to the purpose for which the enrollees provided their numbers. And we reiterate that, when the enrollee is no longer at that number or did not provide a number in the first place, federal and state governmental agencies may nevertheless use autodialers to call or send the text to reach those enrollees, despite a lack of prior express consent.33 We also emphasize that callers and texters have other options to contact enrollees without running afoul of the TCPA.34 Our clarification will enable government and partner callers to communicate time-sensitive, important information to millions of vulnerable American about maintaining their eligibility for critical health care benefits. 12. As we have with past clarifications, we remind unscrupulous callers and texters that they should not view this as a retreat from our aggressive work to combat illegal calls and texts. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the United States, phone scammers have seized the opportunity 30 See NCLC Reply Comments at 4-8. In addition to ensuring that calls and texts are not charged to the recipient, NCLC suggests a number of other conditions including, among others, requiring that all callers check the Reassigned Numbers Database RND, limiting prerecorded call messages to less than one minute, providing opt- out information, limiting the number of calls and messages to one per day and a total of seven over a fourteen-day period, restricting calls and messages to certain hours, and requiring callers to make calls or send text messages via only those voice and text providers that can provide Caller ID reflecting the name and telephone number for the government agency on whose behalf the call is made and STIRSHAKEN attestations. Id. at 5-7. NCLC also requests that the Commission take action to protect consumers from insurance scam calls that could be confused with legitimate calls from state governments and their contractors. See id. at 11-12. As noted below, we will continue to use our enforcement authority to aggressively combat such scams. 31 See Bailey Glasser Comments at 1 Shields Comments at 2-3. 32 See, e.g., Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CG Docket No. 02-278, Declaratory Ruling, 35 FCC Rcd 2840 2020 confirming that health care providers, state and local health officials, and other government officials may lawfully communicate health and safety information about COVID-19 to protect individuals without violating the TCPA, pursuant to the emergency purposes exception. 33 As explained in the 2020 Broadnet Order, because the TCPA does not apply to the federal or state government calls, it cannot apply to federal or state government employees acting in their official capacities. See 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 15057, 15059, n.38  para. 22. 34 As discussed in greater detail below, we strongly encourage callers relying upon prior express consent to call or text enrollees to utilize the RND to determine whether the telephone number provided has been reassigned to another individual. 408 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62 to prey upon consumers.35 For example, we have received reports of scam and hoax text messages and automated calls relating to health care coverage.36 We will be vigilant in monitoring complaints about these calls and will not hesitate to enforce our rules when appropriate. A. Prior Express Consent 13. Consistent with Commission precedent, we confirm that a consumer who provides their telephone number in an application form used to determine eligibility or seek benefits from Medicaid, CHIP, BHP, and Marketplace health care coverage has given their prior express consent to be called or texted at that number by local governments, governmental contractors, and managed care entities when acting under contract and pursuant to the authorization and direction of a federal or state agency with equipment covered by the TCPA regarding eligibility for and ongoing enrollment in those programs.37 That is because these calls and texts contain information closely related to the purpose for which the consumer provided their telephone number.38 To bolster this view, as HHS indicates, these consumers sign an acknowledgment that they may be contacted if more information is needed when they apply for benefits.39 14. We thus agree with HHS and commenters that by providing their telephone numbers on their benefits applications and acknowledging they may be contacted for more information, these consumers have given prior express consent to be called at that number under the TCPA regarding their enrollment eligibility.40 15. Consumers who have applied for benefits in governmental health care programs expect and likely welcome calls and texts that inform them of requirements that may affect the provision of health care benefits for which they have applied, including the potential loss of coverage. The reason consumers apply to such health care programs is to obtain the associated benefits any reasonable consumer would view a call or text designed to prevent termination of benefits as closely related to the purpose for which they provided their telephone number. We thus have no problem concluding that these calls and texts are closely related to the purpose for which enrollees gave their numbers when they applied for benefits. We note, however, that any entity making calls in reliance upon the prior express consent created by the provision of a telephone number on an application for governmental health care benefits should be prepared to demonstrate that they are acting pursuant to the direction and authorization of a governmental agency to make calls or send text messages to enrollees. 35 See Federal Communications Commission, COVID-19 Consumer Warnings and Safety Tips httpswww.fcc.govcovid-scams last visited Sept. 1, 2022. 36 Id. 37 The Commission has made clear in several contexts that persons who knowingly release their telephone numbers for a particular purpose have in effect given their invitation or permission to be called at the number which they have given for that purpose, absent instructions to the contrary. See, e.g., 1992 TCPA Order, 7 FCC Rcd at 8769, para. 31. In the ACA Declaratory Ruling, for example, the Commission clarified that a party who provides his or her wireless number to a creditor as part of a credit application reasonably evidences prior express consent by the cell phone subscriber to be contacted at the number regarding the debt. ACA Declaratory Ruling, 23 FCC Rcd at 564, para. 9 also confirming that the provision of a wireless telephone number to a creditor extended prior express consent to a third-party debt collector calling on behalf of the creditor to collect the debt related to that transaction. 38 See, e.g., Blackboard Declaratory Ruling, 31 FCC Rcd at 9064, para. 23 confirming that the provision of a telephone number by a parent or student to a school provides prior express consent to receive communications from the school closely related to the educational mission of the school or to official school activities absent instructions to the contrary from the party who provides the phone number. 39 See HHS Letter at 8. 40 See, e.g., ACH Comments at 2 Amerihealth Comments at 1 Centene Comments at 1 NCLC et al. Comments at 6-7 NYDH Comments at 2 TennCare Comments at 1. 409 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62 16. We caution, as NCLC urges, that consumers in this context have not consented to calls or texts that contain advertising or constitute telemarketing.41 Consent to make an autodialed or prerecorded call or send an automated text that contains advertising or constitutes telemarketing, must be in writing and after certain disclosures.42 The mere provision of a telephone number does not satisfy these conditions. Additionally, consumers may revoke prior express consent using any reasonable method orally or in writing.43 Callers relying upon prior express consent to make autodialed or prerecorded calls, therefore, must be prepared to honor revocation requests made by any reasonable means from recipients who no longer wish to receive calls and texts relating to governmental health care programs.44 We also note that the burden is on the caller to prove that it obtained the necessary prior express consent if any question arises as to whether prior express consent was provided by a call recipient.45 If so, callers will need to demonstrate that the telephone number called was provided on an application for governmental health care benefits. 17. Finally, we emphasize that even calls made to telephone numbers that have been provided by the called party may be subject to TCPA liability if the number has been reassigned from the person who provided consent.46 As NCLC notes, the Reassigned Numbers Database RND is a critical tool callers should use to avoid calling a person whose telephone number has been reassigned to another individual.47 Callers that make use of the RND can ensure that they are making the most efficient use of their limited resources by avoiding calls to unintended recipients while ensuring compliance with the TCPA.48 We therefore strongly encourage all callers relying upon prior express consent to utilize the RND before making such calls. B. Federal and State Governmental Callers 18. Consistent with Commission precedent, we confirm that federal or state governmental agencies that take the physical steps to make autodialed, prerecorded voice, or artificial voice calls, or send text messages using an autodialer for the purposes HHS describes are not persons subject to the 41 NCLC et al. Comments at 12. 42 See 47 CFR  64.1200a2, b. The term prior express written consent is defined in 47 CFR  64.1200f9 a consumers written consent to receive telemarketing robocalls must be signed and be sufficient to show that the consumer 1 received clear and conspicuous disclosure of the consequences of providing the requested consent, i.e., that the consumer will receive future calls that deliver prerecorded messages by or on behalf of a specific seller and 2 having received this information, agrees in writing to receive such calls at a telephone number the consumer designates. 43 See Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CG Docket No. 02- 278, Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd 7961 at 7996, para. 64 2015 2015 TCPA Order. 44 Id. at 7993, para. 55. HHS indicates that each message will identify the agency that is sending the message or on whose behalf a message is sent and will provide the called party with information on how to opt out of or stop receiving future messages. See HHS Letter at 5. 45 See 2015 TCPA Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 7989-90, para. 47 ACA Declaratory Ruling, 23 FCC Rcd at 565, para. 10. 46 See 47 U.S.C.  227b 47 CFR  64.1200a Advanced Methods to Target and Eliminate Unlawful Robocalls, CG Docket No. 17-59, Second Report and Order, 33 FCC Rcd 12024, 12024-25, para. 1 2018 Reassigned Numbers Order. 47 NCLC et al. Comments at 8-9. The RND is designed to prevent a consumer from getting unwanted calls intended for someone who previously held their phone number. Callers and texters can use the RND to determine whether a telephone number may have been reassigned following a specific date so they can avoid potential liability for calling consumers who have not consented to these calls. See 47 CFR  64.1200m. The Reassigned Numbers Database can be found at www.reassigned.us. 48 Callers may be eligible for a safe harbor if they can prove that they checked the most recent update of the RND and the database erroneously reported that the number had not been reassigned after the caller obtained consent. 47 CFR  64.1200m Reassigned Numbers Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 12043-44, paras. 53-58. 410 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62 TCPA and their calls and texts do not, therefore, require prior express consent. Thus, federal or state governmental callers do need not to obtain the prior express consent of the called party via the provision of a telephone number to make such calls or send such texts. 19. In the 2016 Broadnet Declaratory Ruling and the 2020 Broadnet Order, the Commission made clear that federal and state government callers are not persons subject to the TCPAs restrictions if their calls are made in the conduct of official business.49 The Commission previously found that a caller may be found to have made or initiated a call in one of two ways first, by taking the steps necessary to physically place a telephone call and second, by being so involved in the placing of a specific telephone call as to be directly liable for initiating it.50 Applying that precedent, we clarify that, when HHS or any federal or state agency takes the steps necessary to physically place the calls or texts to enrollees in the governmental health care programs that HHS identifies in its Petition, the federal or state agency is the maker of such call and, therefore, such call is not subject to the TCPA. Informational calls made by federal or state government employees regarding enrollment and eligibility for governmental health care programs are the conduct of official business and nothing in the record indicates an affirmative showing to the contrary. 20. We are unable on this record, however, to confirm that such federal or state agencies, when they are not taking the steps to physically place the call or send the text, are nevertheless so involved in the calls at issue to be deemed the maker or initiator of the communication when a third party is involved in a calling campaign. The Commission has said that could occur when the federal or state government caller makes the decisions regarding whether to make a call, the timing of the call, the call recipients, and the content of the call, among other factors.51 This is a highly fact-specific, case-by- case inquiry.52 No such specific facts are before us. As HHS notes, there will be a wide variety of different calling campaigns involving third-party contractors that will vary from state to state.53 As a result, we decline to opine generally on this issue, and instead simply reiterate Commission precedent to guide callers in assessing their individual circumstances in each state and locality but cannot make a specific ruling on the so involved basis for finding a federal or state agency the maker of the call in any future calling campaigns.54 We note, however, that in the future we might be able to issue case-by-case guidance if HHS or another petitioner were to present us with more specific facts regarding a specific calling campaign and the respective roles of the government and any contractors in those situations. 49 See 2016 Broadnet Declaratory Ruling, 31 FCC Rcd at 7399-41, paras. 12-15 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 15059-61, paras. 22-26 see also NCLC et al. Comments at 3 acknowledging Commission rulings that the TCPA is inapplicable to calls made by the federal government or its employees. State and federal contractors, however, are persons under the TCPA and thus subject to TCPA restrictions. 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 15059, para. 22. 50 DISH Declaratory Ruling, 28 FCC Rcd at 6583, paras. 26-27. The multi-factor analysis for determining liability of third parties under the TCPA is set forth in the DISH Declaratory Ruling, the 2015 TCPA Order, and the Dialing Services Forfeiture Order. See DISH Declaratory Ruling, 28 FCC Rcd at 6583-84, paras. 26-27 2015 TCPA Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 7980-84, paras. 30-37 Dialing Services, LLC, Forfeiture Order, 32 FCC Rcd 6192, 6195-99, paras. 9-18 2017. 51 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd. at 15059, paras. 18-21 these additional factors include the extent to which a person willfully enables fraudulent spoofing, and whether a calling platform knowingly allows clients to use the platform for unlawful purposes. 52 Id. 53 See, e.g., Letter from Daniel Tsai, Deputy Administrator and Director, Department of Health and Human Services to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC at 2 July 13, 2022 filed in CG Docket No. 02-278 noting that every state governmental health care program is unique HHS July 13 ex parte. 54 See, e.g., 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 15059, paras. 18-21 2015 TCPA Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 7978-84, paras. 25-37. 411 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62 21. Lastly, we note that the Commission has acknowledged that federal and state contractors making calls on behalf of governmental entities may also qualify in some instances for forms of derivative immunity. The Commission has stated that courts are best positioned to apply the body of existing immunity law to governmental contractors and make such determinations on a case-by-case basis.55 We, therefore, direct governmental contractors to this body of law to make determinations as to whether they may qualify for derivative immunity in this context. C. Other Options for Contacting Enrollees 22. We believe that the options we describe hereobtaining prior express consent andor having a federal or state agency physically place a callshould ensure HHS and its partners can reach enrollees in a timely manner. However, to the extent that there are limited situations in which callers do not have prior express consent to call or text a wireless telephone number, we confirm that there are a number of other options that callers have to communicate with those consumers without violating the TCPA. 23. Calls to Residential Telephone Lines. We confirm that calls made using an artificial or prerecorded voice message to a residential telephone line56 to raise awareness of the eligibility for and enrollment in Medicaid, CHIP, BHP, and Marketplace, as HHS has described them, are exempt from the prior express consent requirement as calls made for a commercial purpose but which do not include or introduce an advertisement or constitute telemarketing57 because these calls appear to simply inform enrollees about the state of their benefits and how to ensure they do not lose such benefits. Nothing in HHSs request suggests that these communications will advertise a particular insurance product or any other product or service, and thus they do not appear to be advertising or telemarketing. As a result, this exemption is available for calls from local governments, governmental contractors, and managed care entities acting under contract and pursuant to the authorization and direction of a governmental agency in regard to determinations of eligibility for or enrollment in these governmental health coverage programs.58 Of course, if such calls do contain telemarketing or advertising, and are made by persons under the TCPA who lack derivative immunity as noted above, they would require prior express written consent. And, in all cases, these calls must satisfy the Commissions identification requirements if they use artificial or prerecorded voice messages.59 55 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 15057, 15062, paras. 15, 28. 56 The TCPA does not define residential telephone line. We note that a number assigned to a wireless service is not a residential telephone line under section 64.1200 of our rules. Compare 47 CFR  64.1200a1-2 with 47 CFR  64.1200a3. 57 See 47 CFR  64.1200a3ii-iii. We note that the Commission recently amended its rules to limit the number of exempted calls that can be made to a residential line to three artificial or prerecorded voice calls within any consecutive 30-day period for three categories of exemptions. This amendment has not, however, gone into effect. See Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CG Docket No. 02-278, Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd 15188 at 15194, 15197, 15198, paras. 15, 28, 33 2020. 58 See 47 CFR  64.1200a3iii. The term advertisement is defined to mean any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services. 47 CFR  64.1200f1. The term telemarketing is defined as the initiation of a telephone call or message for the purpose of encouraging the purchase or rental of, or investment in, property, goods, or services, which is transmitted to any person. 47 CFR  64.1200f13. HHS indicates that Medicaid and CHIP managed care entities may not include marketing or marketplace activities as defined by Medicaid-related managed care regulations in their automated calls and text messages or prerecorded voice calls. See HHS Letter at 7 citing 42 CFR  438.104. 59 See 47 CFR  64.1200b. All artificial or prerecorded message calls must, at the beginning of the message, state clearly the identity of the business, individual, or other entity that is responsible for initiating the call. In addition, during or after the message, such a call must state clearly the telephone number other than that of the autodialer or prerecorded message player that placed the call of such business, other entity, or individual. Id. continued. 412 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62 24. Communications Not Subject to the TCPA. HHS and its partners have alternative options of communicating with enrollees that are not otherwise subject to the TCPA, and therefore may avoid TCPA restrictions altogether. For instance, callers can use live operators rather than prerecorded voice messages andor non-autodialed text messages.60 Further, they can use email or direct mail to contact enrollees.61 Although these methods may be somewhat less efficient than autodialed calls and texts or prerecorded messages, they nevertheless may offer a reasonable means to communicate important information to consumers without infringing upon the privacy rights protected under the TCPA. 25. Free-to-End User Exemption Requests. We decline to adopt a free-to-end-user exemption in this case as suggested by NCLC.62 We agree with HHS that the imposition of potentially burdensome conditions inherent in any free-to-end-user request may unduly hinder the effectiveness of critical outreach efforts by diverting the already limited resources of state and local governmental agencies to compliance with these conditions.63 Should conditions change, HHS and its partners are, of course, free to request a free-to-end-user exemption from the Commission.64 26. We believe that the guidance we provide today will assist HHS and its partners in complying with the TCPA while making these critical calls. HHS and its partners may also configure their calling and texting efforts to further ensure compliance with the guidance set forth herein. For instance, callers can now verify the prior express consent they have received by checking the RND to identify numbers that have been disconnected and possibly reassigned to other individuals and can use that information to assess whether alternative means of communication should be utilized. We strongly encourage robocallers and robotexters to make use of this tool to avoid potential TCPA liability and to explore the options we identify here as well as any other options that may assist health agencies in making these critical calls. IV. ORDERING CLAUSES 27. For the reasons stated above, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to sections 1-4 and 227 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  151-154, 227, and sections 1.2 and 64.1200 of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  1.2, 64.1200, and the authority delegated in sections 0.141 and 0.361 of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  0.141, 0.361, that this Declaratory Ruling is ADOPTED. 28. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the request filed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on April 28, 2022, IS GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART to the extent discussed herein.  64.1200b1, 2. There are additional requirements for artificial or prerecorded voice calls that include telemarketing but those requirements are not applicable in this context. 60 We caution, however, that a text message sent using a peer-to-peer platform requires consumer consent unless it is not capable of dialing such numbers without a person actively and affirmatively manually dialing each one. See, e.g., Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, P2P Alliance Petition for Clarification, CG Docket No. 02-278, Declaratory Ruling, 35 FCC Rcd 6526 at 6528, para. 8 2020. 61 We decline to address whether HHS and its partners must comply with any legal requirements outside of the TCPA if they opt to send notices via e-mail or direct mail. 62 See NCLC et al. Reply Comments at 4-8. See also 47 U.S.C.  227b2C permitting the Commission to exempt, by rule or order, calls to a telephone number assigned to a cellular telephone service that are not charged to the called party, subject to any conditions set by the Commission. 63 See, e.g., CMMSHHS Reply Comments at 2 HHS July 13 ex parte at 2 noting the resource challenges involved in compliance with additional safeguards including potential cost restrictions. 64 Section 227b2C authorizes the Commission to adopt, by rule or order, exemptions from the prohibition on calls to a telephone number assigned to a cellular telephone service that are not charged to the called party, subject to such conditions as the Commission may prescribe as necessary in the interests of the privacy rights this section is intended to protect. 47 U.S.C.  227b2C. 413 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62 29. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to section 1.4 of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  1.4, this Declaratory Ruling shall be effective upon release.

With this guidance, the Commission provides updated instructions for the industry following the effective date of the final rule. Background. On April 2, 2015, the northern long-eared bat was listed as threatened under the ESA due to the continued spread of white-nose syndrome.3 In January 2016, the Service released a final 4d rule4 and programmatic biological opinion5 requiring protective measures related to the northern long-eared bat. Among other things, the Opinion provided an optional framework to applicants to streamline northern long-eared bat section 7 consultation Streamlined Framework, pursuant to the ESA under certain circumstances.6 1 Revised Tower Construction Guidance for Protection of Northern Long-Eared Bat under the Endangered Species Act, Public Notice, DA 21-1501 WTB 2021 2021 Public Notice. 2 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, News Release, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Reclassifies Northern Long-eared Bat as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act Nov. 29, 2022, httpswww.fws.govsitesdefaultfiles documentsFINAL.FWS .NEWS20RELEASE.NLEB20final20rule.11252022.pdf. 3 Service, Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants Threatened Species Status for the Northern Long-Eared Bat With 4d Rule, 80 Fed.

With this Public Notice, we notify applicants that the 4d rule and Streamlined Framework are null and void once the final rule takes effect on January 30, 2023. Accordingly, an applicant must re-initiate Service consultation for any project that is proposed or is in pre-construction status as of January 30, 2023 and that relied on the 4d and Streamlined Framework. The Service has announced that it is developing other streamlining tools to assist applicants with consultations for the northern long-eared bat, including a rangewide northern long-eared bat determination key available through the IPaC, and an Interim Consultation Framework to help ensure that projects in compliance with the 4d rule are not delayed.13 The Service states that the new formal consultation framework will facilitate the transition from the 4d rule to typical Section 7 consultation procedures for federally endangered animals, until spring 2024.14 We therefore direct applicants to consult with the Services resources15 and the applicants respective field Service office16 to determine how to proceed with the consultation process for any project affected by the Services final rule and ensure continued ESA compliance. 7 Tower Construction Guidance for Protection of Northern Long-Eared Bat under the Endangered Species Act, Public Notice, 31 FCC Rcd 3960 WTB 2016. 8 Id. at 3961 If no action is required with respect to the NLEB, or if the Streamlined Framework applies, the FCC does not require additional reporting.. 9 2021 Public Notice. 10 Id. 11 Service, Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants Endangered Species Status for Northern Long-Eared Bat, 87 Fed.

This system and technical development will improve the recipients filing experience when submitting the mobile network coverage data pursuant to Section 54.1514a, and allow better data integration with the ongoing Broadband Data Collection. Additionally, in conjunction with the system development, the Bureau will release the data specifications associated with the submission of the mobile network coverage reporting and certification. Accordingly, on our own motion, the Bureau waives the deadline provided in Section 54.1514a and announces the revised reporting deadline as March 31, 2023. We find a limited extension is in the public interest. For these reasons, all Stage 2 Mobile support recipients will have until March 31, 2023 to file the required mobile network coverage report, certification, and applicable support data pursuant to Section 54.1514a. 1 47 CFR  54.1514a Stage 2 mobile network coverage report and certification for 66 milestone. 2 The Uniendo a Puerto Rico Fund and the Connect USVI Fund, Order, 34 FCC Rcd 9109, 9163, para. 102 2019. 3 Wireline Competition Bureau Authorizes Stage 2 Mobile Support for Viya in the U.S. Virgin Islands, 35 FCC Rcd 11555 rel.

PhoneBurner and MV Realty PBC, LLC. MV Realty. In these calls, MV Realty operators offered cash to homeowners in a purported exchange for giving MV Realty an exclusive right to list the homeowners property for sale. Pursuant to section 64.1200n2 of the Commissions rules, we hereby provide written notice to all U.S.-based voice service providers2 to take steps to effectively mitigate apparently illegal traffic3 from PhoneBurner and MV Realty.4 We consider blocking the traffic to be an example of effective mitigation. Purpose. Protecting individuals and entities from the dangers of unwanted and illegal robocalls is the Commissions top consumer protection priority. As part of the Commissions multi-pronged approach to combatting illegal robocalls, the Commission has taken steps to encourage voice service providers to 1 Federal Trade Commission, National Do Not Call Registry, httpswww.donotcall.gov. 2 For the purposes of this document, the term voice service provider has a broad meaning that includes any entity originating, carrying, or terminating voice calls through time-division multiplexing TDM, Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP, or commercial mobile radio service CMRS.

Once logged into PhoneBurners software, these operators can call the numbers that PhoneBurners customers specifyin this instance, calls to homeowners. PhoneBurners software offers several options. Here, if a homeowner answers the call, PhoneBurners portal connects the MV Realty operators to the homeowner. If there is no response, PhoneBurners software leaves a prerecorded message andor a text message using MV Realtys preselected script.14 PhoneBurners software also enables its customers to make robocalls that include false or misleading caller ID15for example, by allowing its customers to match outbound calling number area codes to those of the recipients of their robocalls.16 MV Realty is a realtor based out of Delray Beach, Florida.17 MV Realtys robocalls and prerecorded voicemails to phone numbers on the DNC Registry included messages offering homeowners several hundred to several thousands of dollars in exchange for signing a 40-year exclusive listing agreement with MV Realty. At least three states have filed complaints against MV Realty alleging violations of consumer protection laws.18 The Commission also received a complaint from a homeowner who stated that they received three to five unsolicited voicemails from MV Realty each day.19 We consider blocking the traffic to be an example of effective mitigation.

MV Realty group has been calling me and leaving 30 seconds voicemails 3-5 times a day for 3 weeks. 424 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-65 alleging calls to phone numbers on the DNC Registry which were made to the Federal Trade Commission.20 MV Realty placed thousands of calls to numbers on the DNC registry. A significant portion of MV Realtys calls were placed to consumers who had their phones actively listed on the DNC registry. The Enforcement Bureaus investigation identified 11,949,374 calls made to DNC registered numbers by PhoneBurner and MV Realty.21 The Bureau found that 10,926,635 calls were placed to wireless numbers and1,022,739 calls were placed to landline phone numbers actively listed on the DNC Registry.22 The evidence indicates that MV Realtys calls were telephone solicitations. As discussed above, the MV Realty operators offered homeowners cash in exchange for a listing agreement with the company essentially encouraging homeowners Purchase the companys services. Further, the homeowners complaints about MV Realtys calls indicate that they did not give consent to be called and did not have an established business relationship with MV Realty.23 The Bureaus investigation revealed that MV Realty frequently called consumers who repeatedly and affirmatively asked MV Realty to stop calling them.24 The Bureau spoke to former MV Realty employees who described how they were repeatedly asked by consumers to stop calling. In response to these requests, these employees marked the phone numbers as belonging to consumers who did not wish to be called.25 MV Realty failed to remove these homeowners from its calling list despite being notified by MV Realtys own employees.26 As a result, MV Realty called the same consumers repeatedly.27 These repeated calls appear to violate the Commissions telephone solicitation rules.28 Further, PhoneBurners software left prerecorded voicemail messages with the scripted solicitation when homeowners did not answer MV Realtys calls.29 These messages independently appear to violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 TCPA and the Commissions rules, as they are prerecorded voice telemarketing messages sent to consumers without consent.30 Steps that Voice Service Providers Must Take Following this Public Notice. Upon receiving this Public Notice, voice service providers must promptly investigate the traffic identified in Attachment A.31 Within 14 days, each provider must report the results of its investigation to the Bureau including any steps that 20 FTC Consumer Sentinel report on file at EB-TCD-22-00033721. 21 See Call Detail Records on file at EB-TCD-22-00033721. 22 Call Detail Record analysis on file at EB-TCD-22-00033721. 23 MV Realty also is not a tax-exempt nonprofit organization.

Pursuant to section 1.3 of the Commissions rules,34 the Bureau finds that good cause exists in this instance to waive in part the reporting obligations otherwise required by section 64.1200n2 of the rules. In particular, the Bureau concludes that obligating all U.S.-based voice service providers to generate a written report documenting their investigation of the suspected illegal robocall traffic identified in this Public Notice would result in an excessively voluminous record. Accordingly, a voice service provider shall not be required to file a report with the Commission if the provider determines that PhoneBurner or MV Realty are not customers of its services. Any provider filing a report in response to the aforementioned requirements must do so within 14 days of this Public Notice and shall demonstrate its ongoing efforts to mitigate the traffic associated with PhoneBurner or MV Realty. Reports must be filed electronically by email sent to Kristi Thompson, Division Chief, Enforcement Bureau, Telecommunications Consumers Division, at Kristi.Thompsonfcc.gov with copies sent to Lisa Zaina, Asst. Chief, Enforcement Bureau, Telecommunications Consumers Division, at Lisa.Zainafcc.gov and Raul Rojo, Enforcement Bureau, Telecommunications Consumers Division, at 202-418-1336 or by email at Raul.Rojofcc.gov.

Interested parties should focus their comments on the specific issue of whether, if the Commission adopts rules governing the accessibility of closed captioning display settings, it should consider the four factors proposed by the Consumer Groups in 2022  proximity, discoverability, previewability, and consistency and persistence  in determining whether closed captioning display settings are readily accessible.6 Should the four factors have the meanings the Consumer Groups proposed in 2022? Should the factors be non-exhaustive, such that the Commission may consider additional factors as particular situations warrant? Commenters should provide any other information relevant to the Commissions determination of how to proceed on this issue.7 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Second Further Notice included an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFA pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  603, exploring the potential impact on small entities of the Commissions proposals.8 We invite parties to file comments on the IRFA in light of this request for further comment.

In this Order, we consider a complaint alleging that Clear Rate Communications Clear Rate changed Complainants telecommunications service provider without obtaining authorization and verification from Complainant as required by the Commissions rules.1 We find that Clear Rate has responded to the Complainants complaint and has taken action to resolve the complaint. 2. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended the Act, prohibits the practice of slamming, the submission or execution of an unauthorized change in a subscribers selection of a provider of telephone exchange service or telephone toll service.2 The Commissions implementing rules require, among other things, that a carrier receive individual subscriber consent before a carrier change may occur.3 Specifically, a carrier must 1 obtain the subscribers written or electronically signed authorization in a format that satisfies our rules 2 obtain confirmation from the subscriber via a toll-free number provided exclusively for the purpose of confirming orders electronically or 3 utilize an appropriately qualified independent third party to verify the order.4 The Commission has also adopted rules to limit the liability of subscribers when an unauthorized carrier change occurs, and to require carriers involved in slamming practices to compensate subscribers whose carriers were changed without authorization.5 3. We received Complainants complaint alleging that Clear Rate had changed Complainants telecommunications service provider without Complainants authorization. Pursuant to 1 See Informal Complaint No. 5957279 filed Jan. 9, 2023 see also 47 CFR  64.1100  64.1190. 2 47 U.S.C.  258a. 3 See 47 CFR  64.1120. 4 See id.  64.1120c. Section 64.1130 details the requirements for letter of agency form and content for written or electronically signed authorizations. Id.  64.1130. 5 These rules require the unauthorized carrier to absolve the subscriber where the subscriber has not paid his or her bill. If the subscriber has not already paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the subscriber is absolved of liability for charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier for service provided during the first 30 days after the unauthorized change. See id.  64.1140, 64.1160. Any charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier on the subscriber for service provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the subscriber to the authorized carrier at the rates the subscriber was paying to the authorized carrier at the time of the unauthorized change. Id. Where the subscriber has paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the Commissions rules require that the unauthorized carrier pay 150 percent of those charges to the authorized carrier, and the authorized carrier shall refund or credit to the subscriber 50 percent of all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier. See id.  64.1140, 64.1170. 432 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-67 our rules, we notified Clear Rate of the complaint.6 Clear Rate responded, stating that the Complainant had agreed to and authorized the carrier switch.7 It also provided two audio recordingsa third party verification recording TPV and a recording Clear Rate characterized as a quality assurance call. The Division listened to each recording and determined that although the TPV complied with the verification requirements in the slamming rules, the person on the TPV is not the person on the quality assurance call.8 4. Based on all of the information provided by Complainant and Clear Rate, it appears that Clear Rate has fully absolved Complainant of all charges assessed by Clear Rate in a manner consistent with the Commissions liability rules.9 We therefore find that the complaint referenced herein has been resolved.10 5. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  258, and sections 0.141, 0.361 and 1.719 of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  0.141, 0.361, 1.719, the complaint filed against Clear Rate Communications IS RESOLVED. 6.

No. 202332080003  FRN 0008295321 NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILITY FOR FORFEITURE Adopted January 25, 2023 Released January 25, 2023 By the Chief, Enforcement Bureau I. INTRODUCTION 1. Under the rules and orders of the Federal Communications Commission FCC or Commission, telecommunications service providers and certain telecommunications providers collectively, service providers are required to file Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets Worksheets with the Universal Service Administrative Company USAC in furtherance of important regulatory programs implemented by the Commission pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended Act. USAC and the administrators of Telecommunications Relay Service TRS Fund, Local Number Portability LNP, and the North American Numbering Plan NANP rely on information filed in the Worksheets to determine, as prescribed in Commission rules, each service providers equitable and accurate contributions responsibilities for the Universal Service Fund USF and these other federal funding mechanisms, consistent with the Communications Act and our rules.1 Likewise, the Commission relies on the information filed in Worksheets to assess equitable accurate federal regulatory fees owed by each service provider. 2. Failure to file timely, complete, and accurate Worksheets undermines the Commissions efforts to maintain the USF and these other federal programs arising under the Act. The equitable administration of each of these federal payment requirements depends on the timely filing of Worksheets. In this case, Pacific Data Systems Pacific or Company failed repeatedly to file a total of 13 Worksheets between August 1, 2019, and February 1, 2022. We propose in this Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture NAL a penalty of 100,000 against Pacific for its willful failure to comply with its obligations to file the Worksheet due on February 1, 2022, in apparent violation of sections 52.17b, 52.32b, 54.711a, and 64.604c5iiiB of the Commissions rules, and a Commission order.2 II. BACKGROUND A. Legal Framework 3. The Act codifies Congresss historical commitment to promote universal service to ensure that consumers in all regions of the nation have access to affordable, quality telecommunications services. In particular, section 254d of the Act requires, among other things, that every telecommunications carrier providing interstate telecommunications services . . . contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established 1 See, e.g., 47 U.S.C.  254d 47 CFR  64.604c5iii. 2 47 CFR  52.17b, 52.32b, 54.711a, 64.604c5iiiB Wireline Competition Bureau Releases the 2022 Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets and Accompanying Instructions, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 14176, Attach. B, Tbl. 3 WCB 2021 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions. 434 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-68 by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service.3 In implementing this Congressional mandate, the Commission directed all telecommunications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services to contribute to the USF based upon their interstate and international end- user telecommunications revenues.4 The Commission also requires certain providers of interstate telecommunications to contribute to the USF.5 When a service provider fails to pay its share of obligations to the USF, it undermines the Congressional mandates embodied in section 254d of the Act.6 Delinquent contributors also obtain an unfair competitive advantage over companies that comply with the universal service provisions of the Act and the Commissions rules.7 4. The Commission has established specific procedures to administer the USF. Each service provider required to contribute to the USF is required to file annually an FCC Form 499-A, also known as the Annual Worksheet,8 and, with certain exceptions, to file quarterly an FCC Form 499-Q, also known as the Quarterly Worksheet.9 USAC uses the revenue projections submitted in the Quarterly Worksheets to determine each service providers monthly universal service contribution obligation, pursuant to the methodology prescribed by Commission rules.10 A service provider must timely file Quarterly Worksheets by February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year, and Annual Worksheets by April 1 of each year.11 The Commissions rules explicitly warn service providers that failure to file timely forms or submit timely USF payments potentially subjects them to enforcement action.12 The Commissions rules also require that the information contained in the forms must be truthful and that the USF payments must be accurate.13 The Commissions equitable contribution scheme relies on the timely, complete, and accurate filing of Annual and Quarterly Worksheets by all service 3 47 U.S.C.  254d. 4 47 CFR  54.706b. 5 Id.  54.706a Entities that provide interstate telecommunications to the public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available to the public, for a fee will be considered telecommunications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services and must contribute to the universal service support mechanisms.. According to its 2022 Annual Worksheet filing, Pacific provides CLEC services. See httpsapps.fcc.govcgbform499499a.cfm last accessed Dec. 7, 2022. A CLEC is a local exchange carrier that provides some or all of the interstate exchange access services used to send traffic to or from an end user. See 47 CFR  61.26a1. 6 See Telseven, LLC, Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, 27 FCC Rcd 6636, 6637, para. 2 2012 Telseven NAL, forfeiture issued, Forfeiture Order, 31 FCC Rcd 1629 2016 Telseven Forfeiture Order. 7 See id. 8 See, e.g., 47 CFR  54.711 Telseven NAL, 27 FCC Rcd at 6637, para. 2. Within 30 days of beginning to provide service, new service providers must register with the Commission by obtaining an FCC Registration Number FRN from the Commission Registration System CORES and obtaining a Filer ID from USACs E-File system. See, e.g., 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 FCC Rcd at 14199, Attach. 2, Tbl. 2. 9 See, e.g., 47 CFR  54.711 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 FCC Rcd at 14199, Attach. 2, Tbl. 2 Telseven NAL, 27 FCC Rcd at 6637, para. 2. 10 Individual universal service contribution amounts that are based upon quarterly filings are subject to an annual true-up based on the Annual Worksheets. See, e.g., 47 CFR  54.711 Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration, 16 FCC Rcd 5748, 5752-53, para. 12 2001. 11 See, e.g., 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 FCC Rcd at 14199, Attach. 2, Tbl. 2. 12 47 CFR  54.713c. 13 Id.  54.711a, 54.713. An officer of a company completing an Annual Worksheet must certify, in part, as follows I have examined the foregoing report and, to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, all statements of fact contained in this Worksheet are true and that said Worksheet is an accurate statement of the affairs of the above-named company for the previous calendar year. 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 Rcd at 14186, Attach. 1. While the Commission permits revisions to Worksheets in certain circumstances, see id. at 14199- 14200, that opportunity does not affect the separate requirement to submit accurate information in the first instance to the best of the filers knowledge, information and belief. See id. at 14186. 435 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-68 providers.14 A service provider must provide USAC the Worksheets by each filing deadline so that USAC can issue monthly invoices assessing correct USF contribution amounts pursuant to the Commissions rules and orders.15 A service provider shirking its Worksheet filing obligations therefore frustrates Congresss policy objective to ensure the equitable and non-discriminatory distribution of universal service costs among all service providers.16 5. USAC, administrators of other programs arising under the Act, and the Commission rely on the Worksheets service providers file to determine liability for, and subsequent billing and collection of, payments for important federal regulatory cost recovery requirements implemented under the Act.17 The failure of a service provider to file every Quarterly and Annual Worksheet by each filing deadline could result in USAC relying on a smaller base of USF contributions revenues than would otherwise have been reported. The Worksheet filing obligations are therefore necessary to ensure the integrity of the USF. Furthermore, a contributors failure to comply with these filing requirements can impede the very purpose for which Congress enacted section 254dto ensure that service providers contribute to USF on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis. The negative effects on other programs arising under the Act that rely on assessments of the Worksheets are similar. Indeed, a service provider that neglects to submit the most current, accurate revenue information in its Worksheets can evade its federal obligations to contribute fully towards the vital programs linked to the reporting obligations.18 As a consequence of this failure, other service providers might shoulder an unfair burden of the USF and other federal regulatory programs implemented under the Act.19 B. Factual Background 6. Pacific is a private corporation that is incorporated and headquartered in Guam.20 The Company has offered telecommunications services in Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas CNMI, and Hawaii since 2004.21 In 2003, the Commission approved the Companys application for authority to provide international telecommunications resale service under section 214 of 14 See 47 CFR  54.711. The Commission and USAC may review records and documentation underlying revenue reported on a contributors Worksheets to determine whether the contributor is properly reporting revenue, and thus contributing its fair share to the costs of the universal service program.

See LOI Response at 2, Response to Question 13. 436 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-68 the Act.22 On September 23, 2005, the Guam Public Utilities Commission granted a Certificate of Authority COA to Pacific Systems to be a service provider in Guam and provide local exchange services.23 7. Pacific filed its first Annual Worksheet in 2003.24 Between 2003 and 2018, Pacific consistently filed its Annual and Quarterly Worksheets on time.25 However, between August 1, 2019, and, February 1, 2022, Pacific failed to file any of the 13 Worksheets required by the Commissions rules.26 Although USAC repeatedly contacted Pacific concerning the Companys missing Worksheet filings, the Company nonetheless failed to comply with its filing requirements.27 8. On September 13, 2021, USAC referred this matter to the Enforcement Bureau Bureau for investigation of Pacifics repeated failures to file Worksheets.28 On March 7, 2022, the Bureau issued an LOI to Pacific concerning the Companys compliance with requirements arising under the Act and the Commissions rules.29 On April 5, 2022, the Company filed its 2020 and 2021 Annual Worksheets, which were respectively due on April 1 of 2020 and 2021.30 The Company responded to the Bureaus LOI on April 6, 2022.31 In its LOI Response, Pacific acknowledged the Companys failures to file required Worksheets, but claimed it was impeded by staff shortages and COVID-19 issues.32 III. DISCUSSION 9. Based on evidence developed through the Bureaus investigation, the Company apparently violated sections 52.17b, 52.32b, 54.711a, and 64.604c5iiiB of the Commissions rules and Commission orders by willfully and repeatedly failing to file the Companys Worksheets due 22 Id. at 1, Response to Question 8 International Authorizations Granted, Public Notice, 18 FCC Rcd 1857, Rep.

See LOI Response at 9, Response to Question 37. 437 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-68 between August 1, 2019, and February 1, 2022.33 We propose a forfeiture of 100,000 for Pacifics failure to file its Quarterly Worksheet due on February 1, 2022. 10. Service providers, including local exchange carriers like Pacific, must file Annual Worksheets by April 1 of each year, and Quarterly Worksheets by February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year.34 Pacific failed to file 13 Worksheets as follows the Quarterly Worksheets due on August 1 and November 1, 2019, all 10 Worksheets due in 2020 and 2021, and the Quarterly Worksheet due on February 1, 2022. The Company claimed in its LOI response it was unable to complete the filings due to staff shortages and COVID-19 issues that existed at the time.35 However, the Company did not describe in its LOI response the precise circumstances, severity, or duration of the staff shortages and COVID-19 issues it allegedly experienced, and why they consequently were unable to file the required Worksheets on time.36 Pacific has provided no basis to assess whether any alleged COVID- 19 issues were severe enough to impede the Companys Worksheet filing compliance for several years. But even if this was the case, the proper course of action was to seek a waiver of the filing deadlines to obtain a deadline extension, not to ignore major regulatory requirements repeatedly.37 When USAC repeatedly contacted Pacific to remind the Company of the Worksheet filing requirements, Pacific did not raise any need for extensions of the filing deadlines.38 Instead, Pacific simply did not file the required Worksheets for several years. 11. We consider each individual failure to file a Worksheet by each filing deadline a separate violation of sections 52.17b, 52.32b, 54.711a, and 64.604c5iiiB of the Commissions rules and Commission orders.39 We find that the Company apparently violated sections 52.17b, 52.32b, 54.711a, and 64.604c5iiiB of the Commissions rules and Commission orders 13 separate times by willfully failing to file each Worksheet due between August 1, 2019, and February 1, 2022.40 IV. PROPOSED FORFEITURE 12. Section 503b of the Act authorizes the Commission to impose a forfeiture against any entity that willfully or repeatedly fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Act or of any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commission.41 For the violations at issue here, section 503b2B of 33 See 47 CFR  52.17b, 52.32b, 54.711a, and 64.604c5iiiB 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 FCC Rcd 14176 Wireline Competition Bureau Releases the 2021 Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets and Accompanying Instructions, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 13671 WCB 2020 2021 Annual Worksheet Instructions Wireline Competition Bureau Releases the 2020 Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets and Accompanying Instructions, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 1350 WCB 2020 2020 Annual Worksheet Instructions Wireline Competition Bureau Releases the 2019 Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets and Accompanying Instructions, Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd 1801 WCB 2019 2019 Annual Worksheet Instructions. 34 E.g., 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 FCC Rcd at 14199, Attach. 2, Tbl. 2. 35 LOI Response at 11, Response to Question 41a. 36 See id. 37 See, e.g., Streamlined Resolution of Requests Related to Actions by the Universal Service Administrative Company, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 7497, 7525 WCB 2021 granting request for waiver of Annual Worksheet filing deadline due to Coronavirus Schools and Libraries Universal Support Mechanism, 32 FCC Rcd 7456, 7461- 63, paras. 17-21 WCB 2017 finding good cause to waive certain rules and deadlines for contributors whose operations were substantially impacted by hurricanes and thus prevented from meeting filing deadlines. 38 See USAC Letter. 39 See 47 CFR  52.17b, 52.32b, 54.711a, and 64.604c5iiiB 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 FCC Rcd 14176 2021 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 35 FCC Rcd 13671 2020 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 35 FCC Rcd 1350 2019 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 33 FCC Rcd 1801. 40 As explained further below, we propose a forfeiture for only one apparent violation because the other apparent violations occurred outside of the applicable statute of limitations. 41 47 U.S.C.  503b1B. 438 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-68 the Act authorizes us to assess a forfeiture against a service provider such as Pacific of up to 237,268 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, up to a statutory maximum of 2,372,677 for a single act or failure to act.42 In exercising our forfeiture authority, we must consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may require.43 In addition, the Commission has established forfeiture guidelines that establish base penalties for certain violations and identify criteria to consider when determining the appropriate penalty in any given case.44 13. The Commission may adopt upward or downward adjustments to forfeitures when appropriate.45 Under section 1.80 of the Commissions rules, we may adjust a forfeiture upward for egregious misconduct, ability to pay and relative disincentive, an intentional violation, substantial harm, prior violations of Commission requirements, substantial economic gain, or repeated or continuous violations.46 We may adjust a forfeiture downward for a minor violation, good faith or voluntary disclosure, a history of overall compliance, or an inability to pay.47 The forfeiture guidelines listed in section 1.80 of the Commissions rules specifically are intended as a guide for frequently recurring violations and not a complete or exhaustive list of violations.48 14. Section 312f1 of the Act defines willful as the conscious and deliberate commission or omission of any act, irrespective of any intent to violate the law.49 The legislative history to section 312f1 of the Act clarifies that this definition of willful applies to both sections 312 and 503b of the Act,50 and the Commission has so interpreted the term in the section 503b context.51 We therefore find that the Companys failures to file a total of 13 Worksheets required between August 1, 2019, and, February 1, 2022, were willful. Given that the Company failed to file 13 Worksheets between August 1, 2019, and, February 1, 2022, we also find that the Companys apparent filing violations were 42 See 47 U.S.C.  503b2B 47 CFR  1.80b2. These amounts reflect inflation adjustments to the forfeitures specified in section 503b2B of the Act 100,000 per violation or per day of a continuing violation and a statutory maximum of 1,000,000 for a single act or failure to act.

As defined, . . . willful means that the licensee knew that he was doing the act in question, regardless of whether there was an intent to violate the law. Repeated means more than once, or where the act is continuous, for more than one day. Whether an act is considered to be continuous would depend upon the circumstances in each case. The definitions are intended primarily to clarify the language in sections 312 and 503, and are consistent with the Commissions application of those terms . . . .. 51 See, e.g., S. Cal. Broad. Co., Memorandum Opinion and Order, 6 FCC Rcd 4387, 4388 1991. 439 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-68 repeated.52 Section 503b6B of the Act provides that no forfeiture penalty shall be imposed if the violation charged occurred more than one year prior to the date of issuance of the required notice or notice of apparent liability.53 We therefore propose a forfeiture for the Companys failure to file its Quarterly Worksheet due on February 1, 2022. 15. Section 1.80 of the Commissions rules specifies a base forfeiture of 3,000 for failure to file required forms or information.54 Given the importance of the Worksheet filing requirements, the Commission has consistently applied an upward adjustment and proposed a forfeiture of 50,000 for each failure of a service provider to file timely or accurate Worksheets.55 However, given the accumulating record of non-compliance with the requirements to file accurate Worksheets by each filing deadline, service providers failing to comply with these requirements have been provided notice that the Commission could impose substantially higher upward adjustments for prior violations and for repeated or continuous violations.56 Enforcement actions for the failure to file timely or accurate Worksheets can include upward adjustments up to the statutory maximum forfeiture authorized under section 503b2 of the Act.57 16. In assessing a forfeiture amount, we consider the nature, extent, and gravity of the failure to comply with the Worksheet filing requirements to be very serious.58 The Commission, USAC, and the administrators of the TRS Fund, LNP, and NANP rely on the data reported in Worksheets to determine respectively the accurate amounts that service providers owe for regulatory fees, the USF, and these other important funding mechanisms arising under the Act.59 When a service provider fails to report its revenues accurately in its Worksheets by each filing deadline, the service provider could prevent the USF, TRS, LNP and NANP administrators and the Commission from fully invoicing the service provider for federal payment obligations implemented under the Act.60 Pacifics failure to file its Worksheets between August 1, 2019, and, February 1, 2022, had serious implications for the administration of these funding mechanisms. The Commission and the administrators acting on its behalf to assess accurate regulatory fees, and contributions for the USF, TRS Fund, LNP, and NANP, depend on every service providers compliance with the periodic Worksheet filing requirements. A service providers failure to file its Worksheets impedes the Congressional mandate that each service provider contribute on an equitable and 52 Under the Act, 47 U.S.C.  503b1B, any service provider that willfully or repeatedly fails to comply with provisions of the Act or Commission rules or orders issued pursuant to the Act shall be liable for a forfeiture penalty. 53 47 U.S.C.  503b6B. 54 47 CFR  1.80b10, Tbl. 1 to para. b10. 55 E.g., PTT Phone Cards, Inc., Forfeiture Order, 30 FCC Rcd 14701, 14707, para. 19 2015 PTT Forfeiture Order ADMA Telecom, Inc., Forfeiture Order, 26 FCC Rcd 4152, 4155, 4162, paras. 9, 28 2011 ADMA Forfeiture Order Globcom, Inc., Order of Forfeiture, 21 FCC Rcd 4710, 4720-21, 4727, paras. 26-28, 31, 45 2006 Globcom Forfeiture Order. 56 E.g., Correct Solutions, LLC, Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, DA 22-303, 2022 WL 1000385, at 8, para. 26 EB Apr. 1, 2022 Correct Solutions NAL providing notice of future upward adjustments to 100,000 or more PayG, LLC bba Skyswitch, Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, FCC 22-69, at 13, para. 41 Sept. 14, 2022 PayG NAL providing notice of upward adjustments as high as the statutory maximum forfeiture for prior violations and for repeated or continuous violations. 57 See 47 U.S.C.  503b2 PayG NAL at para. 41. 58 See 47 U.S.C.  503b2E. 59 See 47 CFR  1.1154, 1.1157, 52.17a, 52.32, 54.711, 64.604c5iii. 60 See id.  52.17b, 52.32b, 54.711, 64.604c5iiiB Telseven NAL, 27 FCC Rcd at 6643-44, 6646-48, paras. 15, 23-25, Telseven Forfeiture Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 1636, para. 20 Telrite Corp., Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Order, 23 FCC Rcd 7231, 7241-42, para. 24 2008 Telrite NAL, consent decree adopted, Order, 27 FCC Rcd 4110 2012. 440 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-68 nondiscriminatory basis to the USF,61 and to these other important funding mechanisms arising under the Act. We have also considered the degree of the Companys culpability and repeated violations.62 The Company has an important obligation to file accurate Worksheets by the filing deadlines every year, and Pacific has apparently failed to comply for nearly three years. The Company is thus highly culpable for its repeated filing failures. 17. Section 1.80 of the Commissions rules provides for an upward adjustment to forfeiture amounts for prior violations of any FCC requirements and for repeated or continuous violations.63 Consistent with Commission precedent,64 we apply an upward adjustment for the repeated nature of the Companys violations, including the Companys failures to file a total of 13 Worksheets between August 1, 2019, and February 1, 2022.65 We thus apply an upward adjustment to the base forfeiture that not only reflects the extent and gravity of the violation, and the substantial harm to federal cost recovery requirements by not filing Worksheets,66 but also reflects the repeated violations in this case.67 We thus propose a total forfeiture of 100,000. 18. Consistent with the Act and the Commissions rules,68 we have exercised our discretion and considered the specific circumstances related to the Company and the violations it apparently committed, and we therefore find the Company apparently liable for a total proposed forfeiture of one hundred thousand dollars 100,000 for willfully and repeatedly failing to comply with the Commissions Worksheet filing requirements.69 V. CONCLUSION 19. We have determined that Pacific apparently violated sections 52.17b, 52.32b, 54.711a, and 64.604c5iiiB of the Commissions rules and Commission orders by willfully and repeatedly failing to file its Worksheets between August 1, 2019, and February 1, 2022.70 We therefore find that Pacific is apparently liable for a forfeiture of 100,000. 61 See 47 U.S.C.  254d. 62 See id.  503b2E 47 CFR  1.80, Note to para. b10. 63 47 CFR  1.80b10, Tbl. 3 to para. b10. 64 E.g., Correct Solutions NAL at para. 26 providing notice of future upward adjustments to 100,000 or higher forfeitures PayG NAL at para. 41 providing notice of future upward adjustments up to statutory maximum forfeitures. 65 See USAC Letter. 66 See 47 U.S.C.  503b2E 47 CFR  1.80b10, Tbl. 3 to para. b10 PTT Forfeiture Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 14707, para. 19 ADMA Forfeiture Order, 26 FCC Rcd at 4155, 4162, paras. 9, 28 Globcom Forfeiture Order, 21 FCC Rcd at 4720-21, 4727, paras. 26-28, 31, 45. 67 See 47 U.S.C.  503b2E 47 CFR  1.80b10, Tbl. 3 to para. b10 Correct Solutions NAL at para. 26 PayG NAL at para. 41. 68 See 47 U.S.C.  503b2E 47 CFR  1.80b10, Note 2 to para. b10. 69 Any entity that is a Small Business Concern as defined in the Small Business Act Pub.

The Task Force also provides notice that bulk Fabric challenges submitted as much in advance of March 15, 2023, as possible are most likely to be reviewed and adjudicated in time to be accounted for in the next iteration of the Fabric version three to be released in conjunction with the Broadband Data Collection BDC filing window for data as of June 30, 2023 that is due no later than September 1, 2023. Bulk Fabric challenges submitted after March 15, 2023, will still be accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis, however, they would likely be adjudicated as part of a future version of the Fabric.1 On December 27, 2022, the Task Force announced that an updated version of the Fabric version two would be made available in conjunction with the opening of the BDC filing window on January 3, 2023.2 Fabric data is associated with a relevant as-of date for fixed broadband availability data reporting, and we therefore release each updated iteration of Fabric data in conjunction with the opening of a BDC filing window for reporting broadband availability as-of June 30 or December 31 of each year. Version two of the Fabric data serves as the foundation upon which fixed broadband availability data as of December 31, 2022, must be reported no later than March 1, 2023.3 1 NTIA, under its authority under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, continues to target June 30 as the date by which it will allocate each state and territorys BEAD Program funding for high-speed Internet service. httpsntia.govblog2023advancing-internet-all.

The results of location challenges to Fabric version two are expected to be reflected in the Map by November 2023. 2 Broadband Data Task Force Announces Opening of the Second Broadband Data Collection Filing Window, WC Docket Nos. 19-195, 11-10, Public Notice, DA 22-1372 WTBWCBOEA Dec. 27, 2022. Version two of the Fabric contains data from additional data sources and other improvements by the FCC and CostQuest, as well as the results of bulk Fabric challenges submitted by state and local governments and broadband providers on or before November 10, 2022. 3 The FCC will publish the December 31, 2022 broadband availability data, reported and overlaid on to version two of the Fabric, in an update to the NBM in the spring. 445 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-69 As of January 3, 2023, the BDC system only accepts bulk Fabric challenges based upon the data in version two of the Fabric.4 Any bulk challenges to version one of the Fabric that were filed between November 11, 2022, and January 2, 2023, are being carried over and reviewed and adjudicated against version two, and therefore do not need to be refiled bulk challenges submitted on or after January 3, 2023 however, must be submitted against version two of the Fabric. Bulk Fabric challengers should submit their challenges to version two of the Fabric as soon as possible and, in any case, no later than March 15, 2023, to have the best opportunity to be considered in time for preparation of the next version of the Fabric version three. Bulk Fabric challenges submitted after March 15, 2023, are unlikely to be considered for version three of the Fabric and will instead be reviewed and adjudicated as part of a future iteration of the Fabric. Based on our review of the bulk challenges submitted to version one of the Fabric, we reiterate here some of our guidance to assist filers with reviewing Fabric data to assure that filers do not submit challenges seeking to add locations that are already reflected in the Fabric i.e., Type 1 Fabric challenges. As we have previously emphasized, the Fabric is a dataset created by analyzing numerous input data sources to derive geographic coordinates for building footprints i.e., structures that the FCC has determined are broadband serviceable locations BSLs. It is therefore important to reiterate that the Fabric is not a database of addresses, and that address data, while included in the Fabric where available, are an unreliable determinant of the precise geographic coordinates of structures where broadband service can be installed. Preparing a bulk Fabric challenge is fundamentally a geospatial process. Entities therefore should not attempt to upload as a bulk Fabric challenge a list of addresses they have compiled for another purpose e.g., a list of addresses from a billing system or from an E911 database, though these datasets can serve as a helpful starting point for producing a valid bulk Fabric challenge. As an initial step, challengers can attempt to join this type of address-based data to the address information included in the Fabric in order to associate unique Fabric location IDs with the locations in the prospective challengers data.5 But the challenger should not simply upload as a challenge all of the data it is unable to match to an existing location ID using an address matching join. In other words, the fact that an address is missing from the Fabric does not necessarily indicate that the location is missing from the Fabric.6 4 The Fabric data currently displayed on the NBM are version one data, which form the foundation upon which ISPs reported their service availability as of June 30, 2022. Individuals submitting location challenges from the NBM will continue to submit challenges to those Fabric data. See FCC, Which Version of the Fabric Should I Use? Jan. 3, 2023, httpshelp.bdc.fcc.govhcen-usarticles11749189297947-Which-Version-of-the-Fabric-Should-I-Use- individual challenges to both location and availability data, which are submitted directly using the National Broadband Map challenge interface, will also continue to be based on version one of the Fabric until the December 31, 2022, availability data are published.. Individual challenges from the NBM will be reviewed and aligned with updates CostQuest has made in version two of the Fabric and bulk challenges to version two data. 5 We have previously provided guidance on how to perform this joining process, including tools for attempted fuzzy matching of addresses.

Accordingly, challengers should not seek to add additional units as BSLs.

FCC, Bulk Fabric Challenge FAQs Dec. 6, 2022, httpshelp.bdc.fcc.govhcen-usarticles9200359586971-Bulk-Fabric-Challenge-FAQs you might have an 446 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-69 Rather than simply filing a Type 1 challenge consisting of a list of addresses, the challenger should next proceed to a geospatial analysis of both its address data and the data included in the Fabric. The challenger should start by loading the Fabric data into a geospatial analysis tool.7 Loading additional datasetsincluding not only datasets such as billing system data and E911 data, but also additional datasets, such as building footprint imagery data and road datawill allow filers to improve the quality of any challenges.8 After uploading their data sources, filers should undertake a geospatial process to eliminate locations from a challenge that are likely already designated as BSLs in version two of the Fabric and focus on the remaining locations. For example, filers should eliminate any points that fall within a set buffer distance of an existing location point in the version two Fabric data.9 Filers should also eliminate any location data that falls on a road or that that falls outside of a building footprint.10 They can then perform a more detailed review of the remaining points to determine whether a Fabric challenge is warranted and, if so, what category of challenge should be submitted. For any locations included in the challengers data that are not included in the version two Fabric data, filers should format challenges as a .csv file. Importantly, when including address information with a bulk Fabric challenge either as a Type 1 challenge to add a BSL or a Type 2 challenge to change the address data for an existing Fabric location, filers will also need to run their address information through USPS CASS validation to ensure the challenge is not rejected through the FCCs review process.11 As a reminder, entities that had previously entered into a license agreement with CostQuest received an email from CostQuest on or around December 30, 2022, providing them with a link to download version two Fabric data in their covered areas.12 Entities that have not yet entered into a license agreement with CostQuest for Fabric data including internet service providers, state, local or Tribal governmental entities, or other entities wishing to use the Fabric data for purposes of participating in the BDC may do so by following the instructions the Task Force has provided for obtaining access to the Fabric.13 address for an individual unit or substructure that is part of a larger building, such as a condo or apartment, that is already identified as a BSL in the Fabric. If you drop the unitapartment number from your address and the remaining part of the address the street number and street name matches to a location in the Fabric, there is no need to file a challenge.. 7 One such tool is QGIS, a free, open-source mapping tool.

But the category of the challenge may be to, e.g., change the address for the location, rather than to add a BSL to the Fabric. 10 Geographic coordinates for a Fabric challenge point must fall within a building footprint in order to be upheld as a successful Fabric challenge. As a result, if a set of geographic coordinates submitted by a challenger either falls in the middle of a road or otherwise falls outside of a building footprint, then the challenge is likely to be rejected. 11 USPS, CASS, httpspostalpro.usps.comcertificationscass last visited Jan. 17, 2023. 12 CostQuest sent an email from nbfsupportcostquest.com to the Certifying Official identified in the Entity Information page of your BDC system registration providing a link to the updated data file. 13 See Broadband Data Task Force Announces the Availability of the Production Version of the Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric, WC Docket Nos. 11-10, 19-195, Public Notice, DA 22-668 BDTFWCBOEA June 23, 2022.

In this Order, we consider a complaint alleging that Clear Rate Communications Clear Rate changed Complainants telecommunications service provider without obtaining authorization and verification from Complainant as required by the Commissions rules.1 We conclude that Clear Rates actions violated the Commissions slamming rules, and we therefore grant Complainants complaint. 2. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended the Act, prohibits the practice of slamming, the submission or execution of an unauthorized change in a subscribers selection of a provider of telephone exchange service or telephone toll service.2 The Commissions implementing rules require, among other things, that a carrier receive individual subscriber consent before a carrier change may occur.3 Specifically, a carrier must 1 obtain the subscribers written or electronically signed authorization in a format that satisfies our rules 2 obtain confirmation from the subscriber via a toll-free number provided exclusively for the purpose of confirming orders electronically or 3 utilize an appropriately qualified independent third party to verify the order.4 The Commission has also adopted rules to limit the liability of subscribers when an unauthorized carrier change occurs, and to require carriers involved in slamming practices to compensate subscribers whose carriers were changed without authorization.5 3. The Commissions slamming rules prohibit misrepresentations on sales calls to further reduce the incidence of slamming.6 Under the rules, upon a finding of material misrepresentation during 1 See Informal Complaint No. 5925469 filed Dec. 20, 2022 see also 47 CFR  64.1100  64.1190. 2 47 U.S.C.  258a. 3 See 47 CFR  64.1120. 4 See id.  64.1120c. Section 64.1130 details the requirements for letter of agency form and content for written or electronically signed authorizations. Id.  64.1130. 5 These rules require the unauthorized carrier to absolve the subscriber where the subscriber has not paid his or her bill. If the subscriber has not already paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the subscriber is absolved of liability for charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier for service provided during the first 30 days after the unauthorized change. See id.  64.1140, 64.1160. Any charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier on the subscriber for service provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the subscriber to the authorized carrier at the rates the subscriber was paying to the authorized carrier at the time of the unauthorized change. Id. Where the subscriber has paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the Commissions rules require that the unauthorized carrier pay 150 percent of those charges to the authorized carrier, and the authorized carrier shall refund or credit to the subscriber 50 percent of all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier. See id.  64.1140, 64.1170. 6 Id.  64.1120a1iA. 449 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-71 the sales call, the consumers authorization to change carriers will be deemed invalid even if the carrier has some evidence of consumer authorization of a carrier switch, e.g., a third-party verification TPV recording. Sales misrepresentations may not be cured by a facially valid TPV.7 The rule provides that a consumers credible allegation of misrepresentation shifts the burden of proof to the carrier to provide evidence to rebut the consumers claim regarding misrepresentation. The Commission made clear that an accurate and complete recording of the sales call may be the carriers best persuasive evidence to rebut the consumers claim that a misrepresentation was made on the sales call.8 4. We received Complainants complaint alleging that Complainants telecommunications service provider had been changed without Complainants authorization.9 In the complaint, Complainant also alleges that Clear Rates telemarketer convinced her aunt without her understanding to change her Verizon service that she has had for more than 30 years to their service.10 5. Pursuant to our rules, we notified Clear Rate of the complaint.11 Clear Rate responded, stating that the Complainant agreed to and authorized the carrier switch.12 It also provided two audio recordingsa third party verification recording TPV and a recording Clear Rate characterized as a quality assurance call.13 Clear Rate did not provide a recording of the sales call or any other evidence related to the sales call. 6. The Division thoroughly reviewed all the evidence provided by both the Complainant and Clear Rate. Based on the evidence in the record, we find Complainants allegation of a sales call misrepresentation to be credible. We further find that Clear Rate has failed to provide persuasive evidence to rebut Complainants misrepresentation claim and therefore that Complainants authorization to change carriers is invalid. As the Commission stated in the 2018 Slamming Order, when a consumers decision to switch carriers is predicated on false information provided in a sales call, that consumers authorization to switch carriers can no longer be considered binding.14 We therefore find that Clear Rates actions resulted in an unauthorized change in Complainants telecommunications service 7 See Protecting Consumers from Unauthorized Carrier Changes and Related Unauthorized Charges, 33 FCC Rcd 5773, 5778-80, paras. 17-19 2018 2018 Slamming Order 47 CFR  64.1120a1iA. 8 See 2018 Slamming Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 5781, para. 23. The Commission also stated that a carrier is uniquely positioned via its access to sales scripts, recordings, training, and other relevant materials relating to sales calls to proffer evidence to rebut a consumers claims. Id. 9 See Informal Complaint No. 5925469. 10 Id. Complainant also stated that Clear Rate had her aunts phone service turned off, so she went weeks with no landline, and she has a Pace Maker attached to the phone service. It took many hours and lots of trouble to get Verizon to get her service back. Id. 11 47 CFR  1.719 Commission procedure for informal complaints filed pursuant to section 258 of the Act id.  64.1150 procedures for resolution of unauthorized changes in preferred carrier. In the notification, we directed Clear Rate to respond to the specific misrepresentation allegation and to provide any evidence to rebut it. 12 See Clear Rate Response to Informal Complaint No. 5925469 filed Jan. 18, 2023 Clear Rate Response see also 47 CFR  64.1160. 13 We note that on the TPV recording provided by Clear Rate, the third-party verifier repeats the same question several times, even after the Complainant responds no, until the verifier receives a yes response. 14 2018 Slamming Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 5779, para. 18 citing Advantage Forfeiture Order, 32 FCC Rcd 3723, 3725-30, paras. 7-13 2017 finding that the carriers TPV recordings did not disprove that unlawful misrepresentations were made during the telemarketing calls and further, that questions posed during the separate TPV calls did not cure those misrepresentations. 450 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-71 provider, as defined by the rules, and we discuss Clear Rates liability below.15 7. Clear Rate must remove all charges incurred for service provided to Complainant for the first thirty days after the alleged unauthorized change in accordance with the Commissions liability rules.16 We have determined that Complainant is entitled to absolution for the charges incurred during the first thirty days after the unauthorized change occurred and that neither the Complainants authorized carrier nor Clear Rate may pursue any collection against Complainant for those charges.17 Any charges imposed by Clear Rate on the Complainant for service provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the Complainant to the authorized carrier at the rates the Complainant was paying the authorized carrier at the time of the unauthorized change of their telecommunications service provider.18 8. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  258, and sections 0.141, 0.361, and 1.719 of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  0.141, 0.361, 1.719, the complaint filed against Clear Rate Communications IS GRANTED. 9. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to section 64.1170d of the Commissions rules, 47 CFR  64.1170d, Complainant is entitled to absolution for the charges incurred during the first thirty days after the unauthorized change occurred and that Clear Rate Communications may not pursue any collection against Complainant for those charges. 10.

The U.S. Census releases census block, population and cartographic boundary data following each decennial census. Effective April 1, 2023, petitionersapplicants submitting filings to the Audio Division1 must employ the most recent 2020 U.S. Census data available when determining a particular communitys population in addition to the population served and overlap of service areas to communities and Urbanized Areas.2 In the 2010 U.S. Census, Urbanized Areas are defined as a subset of urban areas that contain 50,000 or more people whereas Urban Clusters are defined as urban areas that have a population of at least 2,500 people and less than 50,000 people. In the 2020 U.S. Census, the distinction between \"Urbanized Areas\" and \"Urban Clusters\" are eliminated. Each user must define thresholds within the urban areas for its own purposes.3 Accordingly, we will continue to define an Urbanized Area as an urban area that contains 50,000 or more people. In the 2020 U.S. Census, there are 511 such Urbanized Areas, which is a net increase of 12 from the 499 Urbanized Areas in the 2010 Census.

A county was deemed competitive in the initial price cap test if either 1 50 of locations with BDS demand within the county were within a half mile of a location served by a competitive provider based on data from the 2015 special access data collection or 2 75 of the census blocks within the county had access to broadband from a cable operator, based on Form 477 data as of December 2016. 47 CFR  69.803b1. A grandfathered market is a county that does not satisfy the competitive market test set forth in  69.803 for which a price cap carrier obtained Phase II relief pursuant to  69.711c prior to June 2017. 47 CFR  69.801e, 69.807a. 457 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-76 initial price-cap test results were based on data from the 2015 special access data collection and Form 477 data, as of December 31, 2016.4 On October 25, 2018, the Bureau released a list of study areas served by rate-of-return carriers rate-of-return study areas receiving fixed universal service support that were deemed competitive pursuant to the competitive market test adopted in the Rate-of-Return BDS Order.5 The initial rate-of- return test results were based on Form 477 data, as of June 30, 2017.6 Rate-of-return carriers electing incentive regulation for their business data service BDS offerings serving competitive study areas and price cap carriers serving competitive counties were granted relief from ex ante pricing regulation and tariffing obligations for time division multiplexing TDM-based end-user channel terminations with capacity at or below a DS3.7 The Commission directed the Bureau to update the results of both tests every three years, based on the most recent Form 477 broadband availability data submitted by cable operators.8 For the price-cap update, the Commission directed the Bureau to use a modified version of the initial price-cap test based on updated Form 477 data. Under the subsequent price-cap test, a county is deemed competitive if a cable operator reports that 75 of the census blocks within the county have broadband availability.9 The Commission also directed the Bureau to re-run the rate-of-return test using updated Form 477 data.10 Under the rate-of-return test, a study area is deemed competitive if 75 of the census blocks within the study area are served by a cable operator offering a minimum of 10 Mbps downstream1 Mbps upstream broadband service.11 The Commission directed the Bureau to update the price-cap and rate-of-return test results every three years, following the 2020 price cap test, using Form 477 data as of the date of the most recent 4 47 CFR  69.803b1. Pursuant to the initial price-cap market test, 1,879 counties were deemed competitive, 1,276 counties were deemed non-competitive, and 69 counties were in grandfathered markets.

Given the high sunk costs involved in network deployment, the Commission determined that once a price-cap county or rate-of- return study area is deemed competitive, it would retain its competitive status and not be retested. 47 CFR  61.50j3, 69.803c3 see Price Cap BDS Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 3528-29, para. 152 Rate-of-Return BDS Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 10439, para. 103. 458 Federal Communications Commission DA 23-76 collection.12 The Bureau now updates the results of both tests using Form 477 data reflecting the availability of broadband service from cable operators as of December 31, 2021.13 Based on these data, the Bureau, in coordination with the Office of Economics and Analytics, tested price-cap counties that were previously deemed to be non-competitive and retested rate-of-return study areas receiving fixed universal service support that were previously deemed not to be competitive.14 The Bureau found that 15 price-cap counties that were previously deemed non-competitive now meet the competitive threshold established by the Commissions rules. The price cap-served areas within those counties are therefore deemed competitive, effective immediately.15 The Bureau also found that five additional rate-of-return study areas receiving fixed universal service support meet the applicable threshold and are therefore deemed competitive, also effective immediately.16 The lists of price-cap counties and rate-of-return study areas newly deemed competitive pursuant to the updated test results are attached as Appendices A and B, respectively. Parties wishing to challenge these updated test results may file a petition for reconsideration with the Bureau or an application for review with the Commission.17 Pending any challenges to these results, the newly deemed-competitive price-cap counties and rate-of-return study areas will not be retested in subsequent three-year updates.18 These lists supplement the lists of price-cap counties and rate-of-return study areas deemed competitive pursuant to the initial and first supplemental competitive market tests which are also available on the Commissions website.19 For further information, please contact Erik Raven-Hansen, Pricing Policy Division, Wireline Competition Bureau, at 202 418-1532 or via email at Erik.Raven-Hansenfcc.gov.

Perry 210 Amendment Purpose.pdf filed Dec. 7, 2022. 470 Discussion. In the NCE MX Group 59B Order, the Bureau rescinded the tentative selection of Big Bend and conducted a third 307b analysis and identified Elijah as the tentative selectee of this group.12 However, upon release of the Order, counsel for GPTC informed the Bureau that the staff neglected to address the GPTC Petition.13 Although the GPTC Petition primarily argues that the tentative selection of Big Bend should be rescinded, the petition also noted that the November 2022 Fair Distribution Order relied on the incorrect fair distribution exhibit when analyzing the Elijah Application, specifically relying on the exhibit provided in the original application instead of the revised exhibit in the application as amended on January 28, 2022.14 The NCE MX Group 59B Order also mistakenly relied on Elijahs original fair distribution exhibit instead of its revised exhibit. Accordingly, we rescind the NCE Group MX 59B Order to the extent it identified the Elijah Application as the new tentative selectee of NCE MX Group 59B and conduct a new fair distribution analysis considering Elijahs revised fair distribution exhibit.15 Elijah and GPTC each claims that it is eligible for a fair distribution preference based on combined first and second NCE population totals.16 The other applicants do not. Accordingly, Big Bend, Faith, Church Planters, and Bemiss are each eliminated. Elijah would provide a combined first and second NCE service to 2,149 people and GPTC to 6,971 people. The proposals are comparable because neither exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people.17 Thus, we are unable to designate a tentative selectee under a 307b fair distribution analysis, and GPTC and Elijah will proceed to a point system analysis. The point system analysis, which is conducted when section 307b is not determinative, must be conducted by the Commission, as this analysis is considered a simplified hearing for purposes of section 155c1 of the Act.18 Accordingly we have referred the matter to the Commission to make a determination under a point system analysis.19 12 NCE MX Group 59B Order at 4, para. 10. 13 Email from Margaret L.

See 47 CFR  73.7003e and f3. However, an applicant that subsequently makes engineering changes that would diminish its fair distribution position must amend its application to reflect that diminished position. See 47 CFR  1.65 and 73.7003e. Elijahs revised fair distribution exhibit, which the staff inadvertently did not consider, reflects Elijahs diminished position. 16 See Elijah Application and GPTC Application, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits. Elijahs 60 dBu contour encompasses 16,634 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 2,149 people. GPTCs 60 dBu contour encompasses 19,136 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 6,971 people. Thus, each would provide combined first and second NCE service to at least 10 percent of the population within its respective 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people. 17 The applicant proposing to provide service to the greatest number of people will only be awarded a construction permit if it will provide such service to at least 10 of the people within the station's 60 dBu contour and to at least 5,000 more people than the next best applicant.

INTRODUCTION 1. Unmanned aircraft are being used to deliver consumer packages and life-saving medical supplies, facilitate the rapid restoration of power infrastructure after a storm, and aid in first responder missions such as search and rescue and wildfire management, among innumerable other beneficial public and private uses. These operations depend on wireless communications for purposes ranging from flight control communications between a ground-based control station and the unmanned aircraft UA hereinafter referenced collectively in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NPRM as an unmanned aircraft system or UAS to the delivery of mission-related payload information from the UA.1 In this NPRM, we take several steps to promote access by UA operators to licensed spectrum for these purposes. 2. First, we address the 5030-5091 MHz band, which the Commission previously allocated to support terrestrial control links for UAS without adopting service rules. Because technical work regarding UAS is still in a nascent stage, we anticipate that service rules sufficient to facilitate UAS operations will likely require development in phases. We now take the first step to develop such rules. We seek comment on service rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band that will provide UAS operators with access to licensed spectrum with the reliability necessary to support safety-critical UAS communications links. Second, due to the increasing interest in operating UAS using existing terrestrial flexible-use spectrum networks, we seek comment on whether the Commissions rules are adequate to ensure co- existence of terrestrial mobile operations and UAS use or whether changes to our rules are necessary.2 Third, to further promote the safe integration of unmanned aircraft operations in controlled airspace and facilitate flight coordination, we propose a process for UAS operators to obtain a license in the aeronautical VHF band to communicate with air traffic control and other aircraft. Together, these measures will help to promote the growth and safety of UAS operations.3 3. This proceeding implicates the jurisdiction and concerns of multiple federal agencies. The Federal Aviation Administration FAA has the jurisdictional responsibility to ensure the safety of aircraft, including UAS, and is tasked by statute with the safe integration of UAS into the National Airspace System.4 The National Telecommunications and Information Administration NTIA, which administers the federal use of spectrum, has jurisdictional interests in the 5030-5091 MHz band, including 1 More specifically, we use the term unmanned aircraft systems UAS in this NPRM to reference a UA together with all the associated elements including communication links and the components that control the UA that are required for the safe and efficient operation of the UA in the airspace of the United States. As discussed below, we seek comment on our proposal to adopt this definition of unmanned aircraft system for the 5030-5091 MHz band service rules. 2 To this end, we seek comment on the sufficiency of the current flexible-use rules to prevent interference to and from UAS operations, and on whether we can eliminate the current prohibitions on airborne operations applicable to certain of these flexible-use bands. 3 We note that AURA Network Systems OpCo, LLC and A2G Communications, LLC, have a pending petition for rulemaking requesting rule changes to allow the 450 MHz General Aviation Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service band to be used for a broader range of services, including data communications with UAS. See Petition for Rulemaking by AURA Network Systems OpCo, LLC and A2G Communications, LLC to Permit the Transmission of Data in Air-Ground Radio Telephone Automated Service Channels Between 454.675-454.975 MHz and 459.675- 459.975 MHz, RM-11912 filed Feb. 16, 2021 AURAA2G Petition. We expect to address the AURAA2G Petition in another proceeding. 4 See 49 U.S.C.  44802. The National Airspace System consists of 1 a network of both controlled and uncontrolled airspace, 2 air navigation facilities, equipment and services, 3 airports and landing areas, 4 aeronautical charts, information and services, 5 rules and regulations, 6 procedures and technical information, and 7 manpower and material. See FAA, National Airspace System, httpswww.faa.govair_trafficnas last visited Sept. 6, 2022. 475 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 potentially using the band for federal UAS operations and ensuring the adequate protection of certain other federal uses in and adjacent to the 5030-5091 MHz band. As a part of their respective jurisdictional responsibilities, both the FAA and NTIA have been examining the potential use of the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS operations, and the FAA has adopted a minimum performance standard for UAS radio equipment operating in the 5040-5050 MHz sub-band of the 5030-5091 MHz band.5 Accordingly, a whole-of-government approach is needed to ensure that this proceeding addresses the relevant concerns and issues within the responsibility of each stakeholder agency and that our efforts in this area work in complement with those of our federal partners to support and promote the safe and productive operation of UAS. To facilitate this approach, we have consulted with these agencies in the preparation of this NPRM, and will continue to do so as the proceeding advances. II. UAS COMMUNICATIONS IN THE 5030-5091 MHZ BAND A. Background 4. Because a UA, to the extent its route is not pre-programmed, must be operated remotely, the operator depends critically on wireless communications between a ground-based control station and the UA to control the flight of the UA, including communications to send commands to the aircraft and to receive telemetry and other data from it. UAS also increasingly employ wireless signals for other safety- related purposes, such as to detect and avoid other aircraft. Currently, no spectrum is licensed in the United States exclusively for UAS communications, and operators have generally relied on unlicensed operations or experimental licenses. Neither of these spectrum resources provide the user with any right to protection from harmful interference, and as a result, the reliability of communications using these resources can be uncertain. As UA flights increasingly involve operations with a higher risk profile, such as flights that use large aircraft, carry heavy cargo or human passengers, or travel into the controlled airspace used by commercial passenger aircraft,6 operators have a growing need for the greater reliability that interference-protected licensed spectrum provides for control-related and other safety-related communications. 5. In 2017, the Commission determined that the 5030-5091 MHz band should be allocated to help address that need.7 Prior to the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference WRC-12, the 5 The FAAs actions to integrate UAS into the National Airspace System have also involved many regulatory efforts not specific to the 5030-5091 MHz band. For example, in 2016, the FAA, together with the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, adopted rules authorizing the routine operation of small UAs those weighing less than 55 pounds, subject to certain restrictions and limitations. See Federal Aviation Administration and Office of the Secretary of Transportation, Department of Transportation, Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, 81 Fed. Reg. 42064 June 28, 2016 to be codified at 14 CFR pts. 21, 43, 61, 91, 101, 107, 119, 133, 183. Among other restrictions, the rules did not permit such operations over people or at night without an individual waiver. See id. at 42102, 42123. Subsequently, the FAA modified these regulations and authorized routine operations of small UAs over people and operation at night under certain circumstances. See Federal Aviation Administration and Office of the Secretary of Transportation, Department of Transportation, Operation of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Over People, 86 Fed. Reg. 4314, 4314-15 Jan. 15, 2021. At the same time, the FAA also adopted rules establishing requirements for the remote identification of UAs operating in the United States. See Federal Aviation Administration, Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft, 86 Fed. Reg. 4390 Jan. 15, 2021 Remote ID Rules. 6 The FAA defines controlled airspace as an airspace of defined dimensions within which air traffic control service is provided to instrument flight rules flights and to visual flight rule flights in accordance with the airspace classification. NOTE Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E airspace. 14 CFR  1.1 General Definitions. Controlled airspace is found around some airports and at certain altitudes where air traffic controllers are actively communicating with, directing, and separating all air traffic. See FAA, Airspace 101 Rules of the Sky, httpswww.faa.govuasrecreational_flierswhere_can_i_flyairspace_101 last visited Sept. 6, 2022. 7 See Amendment of Parts 2, 15, 80, 90, 97, and 101 of the Commissions Rules Regarding Implementation of the Final Acts of the World Radiocommunication Conference Geneva, 2012WRC-12, Other Allocation Issues, and continued. 476 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 5030-5091 MHz band was allocated both internationally and in the United States to the aeronautical mobile-satellite route service AMSRS and the aeronautical radionavigation service ARNS on a primary basis.8 Footnote 5.444 of the Table of Frequency Allocations further provides that the spectrum is to be used for the operation of the international standard system microwave landing system for precision approach and landing and gives microwave landing systems priority over other uses of the band.9 At the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference, the United States proposed that the 5030- 5091 MHz band also be allocated to the aeronautical mobile route service AMRS on a primary basis in order to support terrestrial control links for UAS, in light of 1 the anticipated growth of UAS operations, 2 the limited use of the band worldwide at that time, and 3 the lack of microwave landing system deployment in the United States at 5030-5091 MHz.10 Consistent with the United States proposal, the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference allocated the 5030-5091 MHz band internationally to the AMRS on a primary basis in all Regions.11 6. In 2017, the Commission adopted a Report and Order taking several steps in response to the decisions from the 2012 World Radio Conference.12 Among other measures, the Commission mirrored the international allocation at 5030-5091 MHz in its domestic allocations, specifically allocating the 5030-5091 MHz band to the AMRS on a primary basis for both federal and non-federal use.13 Under the Commission rules, AMRS is defined as an aeronautical mobile service reserved for communications relating to safety and regularity of flight, primarily along national or international civil air routes.14 The Commission found that adopting the new AMRS allocation would support the anticipated growth of UAS and promote their safe operation.15 The Commission did not adopt any rules Related Rule Updates, ET Docket No. 15-99, Report and Order, 32 FCC Rcd 2703, 2717, para. 42 2017 WRC-12 RO. 8 See Amendment of Parts 1, 2, 15, 25, 27, 74, 78, 80, 87, 90, 97, and 101 of the Commissions Rules Regarding Implementation of the Final Acts of the World Radiocommunication Conference Geneva, 2007 WRC-07, Other Allocation Issues, and Related Rule Updates et al., ET Docket No. 12-338, et al., Report and Order, Order, and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 30 FCC Rcd 4183, 4262, paras. 223-24 2015 WRC-12 NPRM 47 CFR  2.106. Under the Commissions Table of Frequency Allocations rules, Aeronautical Mobile-Satellite Route Service AMSRS is defined as an aeronautical mobile-satellite service reserved for communications relating to safety and regularity of flights, primarily along national or international civil air routes. 47 CFR  2.1c. Aeronautical Radionavigation Service ARS is defined as a radio-navigation service intended for the benefit and for the safe operation of aircraft. Id. 9 See 47 CFR  2.106, footnote 5.444. 10 See WRC-12 NPRM, 30 FCC Rcd at 4262, para. 225. 11 See WRC-12 NPRM, 30 FCC Rcd at 4263, para. 226. 12 See generally WRC-12 RO. 13 See WRC-12 RO, 32 FCC Rcd at 2717, para. 41. The status of primary gives AMRS priority over any services allocated on a secondary basis, see 47 CFR  2.105c2, but AMRS remains subject to the higher priority of MLS provided by Footnote 5.444. See 47 CFR  2.106, footnote 5.444. The Commission also added Footnote 5.443C to this allocation band limiting its use to internationally standardized aeronautical systems and setting limits for unwanted emissions from AMRS stations to adjacent band radionavigation-satellite service RNSS downlinks to an EIRP density of -75 dBWMHz. See WRC-12 RO, 32 FCC Rcd at 2717, para. 41 see also 47 CFR  2.106, footnote 5.443C. 14 47 CFR  2.1c. The Commission defines the term aeronautical mobile service, in relevant part, as a mobile service between aeronautical stations and aircraft stations, or between aircraft stations. Id. An aeronautical station is defined as a land station in the aeronautical mobile service. Id. An aircraft station is defined as a mobile station in the aeronautical mobile service, other than a survival craft station, located on board an aircraft. Id. 15 See WRC-12 RO, 32 FCC Rcd at 2717, para. 42 see also id. at 2704, para. 1 stating that AMRS use of the 5030-5091 MHz band will support unmanned aircraft systems. 477 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 to license or govern UAS services in the band, however instead, it stated that technical and operational rules relating to altitude, weight, or other requirements will be addressed in the service rules for this band, which will be promulgated in a separate proceeding.16 7. AIA Petition for Rulemaking. On February 8, 2018, the Aerospace Industries Association AIA filed a petition for rulemaking recommending licensing and service rules for control-and-non- payload communications CNPC links in the 5030-5091 MHz band to support UAS operations in the United States AIA Petition.17 AIA proposed that individual UAS operators that meet certain qualifications or organizations that employed such operators be able to obtain a non-exclusive, nationwide Commission spectrum license, which would authorize them to use the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS CNPC subject to a dynamic frequency assignment process.18 AIA further recommended the Minimum Operational Performance Standards MOPS for UAS CNPC links issued by RTCA in 2016 and designated as RTCA DO-362 as a good starting point for the Commissions consideration of licensing and operational rules.19 Noting that the AMRS allocation of the band is limited to communications 16 See WRC-12 RO, 32 FCC Rcd at 2717, para. 42. 17 See Petition of AIA for Rulemaking to Adopt Service Rules for Unmanned Aircraft Systems UAS Command and Control in the 5030-5091 MHz Band, RM-11798 filed Feb. 8, 2018 AIA Petition. 18 See AIA Petition at 6-7, 9-10. In its petition, AIA used the terms control-and-non-payload and command-and- control or C2 interchangeably. See, e.g., AIA Petition at 7 referring to CNPC links, 8 referring to C2 communications links. We similarly do so throughout this NPRM. 19 See AIA Petition at 7. RTCA is a standards development organization that works with the FAA to develop standards that can be used as means of compliance with FAA regulations. See RTCA, About Us, httpswww.rtca.orgabout last visited Sept. 6, 2022. RTCA Special Committees SCs develop Minimum Operational Performance Standards MOPS among other standards documents related to aviation. See RTCA, Standards  Guidance Materials Descriptions, httpswww.rtca.orgstandardsstandards-guidance-materials last visited Sept. 6, 2022. According to RTCAs website, MOPS provide standards for specific equipments useful to designers, manufacturers, installers and users of the equipment. . . . MOPS provide the information needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated, describe typical equipment applications and operational goals, and establish the basis for required performance under the standard. Definitions and assumptions essential to proper understanding are provided as well as installed equipment tests and operational performance characteristics for equipment installations. Id. RTCA MOPS are often referenced as a basis for equipment certification in FAA technical standard orders. See id. Technical standard orders establish minimum performance standards for specified materials, parts, and appliances used on civil aircraft. See FAA, Technical Standard Orders TSO, httpswww.faa.govaircraftair_certdesign_approvalstso last visited Sept. 6, 2022. RTCAs Special Committee 228 SC-228, established on May 20, 2013, is working to develop, among other things, Command-and-Control Data Link MOPS for the 5030-5091 MHz band. See RTCA, SC-228, Minimum Performance Standards for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, httpswww.rtca.orgcontentsc-228 last visited Sept. 6, 2022. The committee published the first version in September 2016 with the release of DO-362, Command and Control C2 Data Link Minimum Operational Performance Standards MOPS Terrestrial RTCA DO-362. In response, the FAA adopted Technical Standard Order C213, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Control and Non-Payload Communications Terrestrial Link System Radios, effective March 9, 2018. See Federal Aviation Administration, Aircraft Certification Service, Technical Standard Order C213, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Control and Non- Payload Communications Terrestrial Link System Radios 2018 TSO-C213. TSO-C213 adopted the RTCA DO- 362 standard as a minimum performance standard for new models of UAS CNPC Link System radios operating in the 5040-5050 MHz portion of the 5030-5091 MHz band. See TSO-C213 at 1. On December 20, 2022, the FAA issued a revision of TSO-C213, designated TSO-C213a. See Federal Aviation Administration, Aircraft Certification Service, Technical Standard Order C213a, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Control and Non-Payload Communications Terrestrial Link System 2022 TSO-C213a, available at FAA, Technical Standard Orders, httpsdrs.faa.govbrowseTSOdoctypeDetails. TSO-C213a replaces TSO-C213 going forward, adopting aspects of RTCA DO-362A, the second version of the RTCA MOPS for the 5030-5091 MHz band, as minimum performance standards for CNPC Link Systems designed for operations within any spectrum in the 5030-5091 MHz band. See TSO-C213a at 2 RTCA, Command and Control C2 Data Link Minimum Operational Performance Standards MOPS Terrestrial, RTCA-DO-362A 2020 RTCA DO-362A. 478 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 relating to safety and regularity of flight, AIA also advocated for prohibiting any non-UAS use of the 5030-5091 MHz band or any UAS use for payload communications or other non-safety or non-route services.20 8. The Commission sought public comment on AIAs petition on April 26, 2018.21 Eight parties filed comments, and four filed replies.22 The majority of commenters supported commencement of a rulemaking to license the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS communications, and several supported aspects of the AIA proposal.23 Some raised concerns, however, that the proposal was too restrictive in the operations it would support or permit and that the 5030-5091 MHz band would not in any case be able to support all UAS operations those commenters recommended that the Commission not preclude use of other bands for UAS operations.24 9. Section 374 Report. Section 374 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 directs the FAA, the FCC, and NTIA to submit a report to specified committees of the House and Senate on, among other things, whether UAS operations should be permitted, but not required, to operate on the 5030- 5091 MHz band on an unlicensed, shared, or exclusive basis, for operations within the UAS Traffic Management system or outside of such a system.25 On November 25, 2019, the Office of Engineering and Technology OET and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau WTB collectively, the Bureaus sought public comment on this issue and others identified in Section 374 of the FAA Reauthorization Act Section 374 Public Notice.26 Twenty-three parties filed comments, and eleven filed replies.27 On August 20, 2020, the Bureaus jointly submitted a report to Congress on behalf of the Commission addressing the matters specified in Section 374.28 In their report, the Bureaus found that the 5030-5091 MHz band appears to offer promise for intensive UAS use because it is unencumbered29 and recommended that the Commission initiate a rulemaking proceeding to develop service and licensing rules enabling UAS use of the 5030-5091 MHz band in collaboration with the FAA and NTIA.30 10.

Discussion 11. As reflected in the comments to the AIA Petition and the record in response to the Refresh Public Notice, UAS manufacturers and other stakeholders have continued to express strong interest in a proceeding to enable licensing of the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS CNPC links since the Commission added an AMRS allocation in the 5030-5091 MHz band to enable interference-protected UAS communications.33 The Section 374 Report released by WTB and OET in 2020 also supports the commencement of a rulemaking proceeding to adopt service rules enabling UAS operations in the 5030- 5091 MHz band.34 Accordingly, we propose to adopt a band plan and service rules in the 5030-5091 MHz band to enable UAS operators to use interference-protected CNPC links. We seek comment on our proposal and on options to make the band available for this purpose. We further seek comment on the costs and benefits of any such options, including the costs and benefits of the specific band plan and service rules options discussed below. UAS platforms offer potential benefits in particular to disadvantaged, remote and rural communities, including delivery of essential goods or medical and other critical supplies in hard-to-reach areas, as well as innovative agricultural uses. We seek comment on measures that will facilitate UAS use and promote equity for these underserved populations. We encourage stakeholders to develop and submit consensus recommendations on service rules for the 5030- 5091 MHz band, including recommendations on the issues and proposals discussed below. 12. We do not intend to mandate that all UAS CNPC occur exclusively in the 5030-5091 MHz band. Other licensed bands, including the flexible-use bands where mobile networks are already deployed nationwide and the 450 MHz General Aviation Air-Ground band, are being explored as platforms for UAS operations, including UAS CNPC. Commenters in this proceeding broadly support the availability of these bands as resources to help meet the rapidly growing spectrum access needs of the UAS community.35 In addressing the 5030-5091 MHz service rules, we do not propose to mandate that all CNPC occur within the band, nor do we intend that the future rules adopted in this proceeding for 5030-5091 MHz will necessarily govern any UAS operations in other bands. Rather, through this proceeding, we seek to provide UAS operators with access to an additional spectrum resource that may complement other spectrum resources that are currently available or in development. The 5030-5091 MHz band is a limited resource, and the demand for protected UAS CNPC may well exceed the capacity of the band as UAS operations increase over time.36 Further, while existing networks operating in other bands such as flexible-use bands may provide sufficient reliability for many UAS use cases, authorization of the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS use offers an opportunity to apply standards and rules designed to 31 See Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Seeks to Refresh the Record on Unmanned Aircraft Systems Use of the 5 GHz Band, RM-11798, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 12706 WTB 2021 Refresh Public Notice. 32 Parties that filed comments and reply comments in response to the Refresh Public Notice are listed in Appendix C. 33 See, e.g., AIA Refresh PN Comments at 1-3 ASRI Refresh PN Comments at 1, 4 AURA Refresh PN Comments at 1 AeroVironment Refresh PN Comments at 1 CDA Refresh PN Comments at 1 EEI Refresh PN Comments at 1 FPL Refresh PN Comments at 4 Qualcomm Refresh PN Comments at 1. 34 Section 374 Report at 1, 12. 35 See infra n.255. 36 See Letter from John W. Kuzin, Vice President, Spectrum Policy  Regulatory Counsel, Qualcomm, to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, RM-11798 filed Mar. 15, 2022 Qualcomm Mar. 15, 2022 Ex Parte. Qualcomm performed simulations that purport to show that, as the number of UAS per cell increases, both uplink data throughput and uplink latency increase to levels that may exceed acceptable target values. See id., Attach. at 12-17. To combat these capacity issues in the 5030-5091 MHz band, Qualcomm suggests that terrestrial mobile networks in other bands could be utilized for lower altitude operations and offloaded to the 5030-5091 MHz band above a certain height threshold. See id., Attach. at 22. 480 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 meet even the most safety-critical communications needs.37 In addition, as we discuss below, technical standards have already been developed for the 5030-5091 MHz band specifically to support reliable UAS CNPC, whereas work is still nascent to establish or demonstrate the reliability of CNPC standards or operations in other bands. As a result, the 5030-5091 MHz band has the potential to be available for safety-critical aviation needs more quickly than licensed spectrum in these other bands. We tentatively conclude that, while other spectrum bands are available for UAS communications, licensing the 5030- 5091 MHz band specifically for UAS CNPC will have important public interest benefits. We seek comment on this tentative conclusion and the extent to which the 5030-5091 MHz band may offer unique advantages over other bands in supporting UAS CNPC. 1. Band Plan 13. Below, we seek comment on an appropriate band plan for communications to support the growth and safety of UAS operations. For the purpose of this band and its service rules, and consistent with the FAA definitions of the terms, we propose to define UAS as an unmanned aircraft UA and its associated elements including communication links and the components that control the UA that are required for the safe and efficient operation of the UA in the airspace of the United States, and to define a UA as an aircraft operated without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the aircraft.38 We seek comment on these proposed definitions and on any alternatives. We further identify two broad UAS use cases for purposes of determining the appropriate band plan and service rules  non- networked operations, generally occurring within radio-line-of-sight39 of the UAS operator, and network- supported operations, which rely on network infrastructure to go beyond radio-line-of-sight of the operator. Non-networked operations involve flights within a sufficiently localized area that can rely on direct wireless links between the UAS operators controller and the UA and therefore do not require any supporting network infrastructure. Such operations may include, for example, tower or other site inspections, public safety operations, or localized surveillance. In contrast, network-supported operations rely on deployed network infrastructure, such as cell towers and sites, to relay information between the operator and the UA and may therefore extend far beyond the range of direct wireless links between operator and UA.40 While UAS operations have in the past been predominantly non-networked operations, there is growing interest in and exploration of network-supported operations, such as for package delivery, mapping, search-and-rescue, long-range infrastructure inspections e.g., involving 37 See, e.g., ASRI Refresh PN Comments at 1 asserting that the 5030-5091 MHz band is central to successful UAS development and advancement, particularly for larger UAS operating in FAA-controlled airspace. 38 See 14 CFR  1.1 accord 49 U.S.C.  4480111, 12 defining unmanned aircraft and unmanned aircraft system. While our rule proposal thus focuses use of the band on communications for the operation of a type of aircraft, which meets the definition of a part 87 aviation service, see 47 CFR  87.5, we note that a network-based communications service offered to operators of UAS would typically also be a commercial service providing access to wide-area networks, in contrast to the largely if not entirely non-commercial and non-network-based services regulated under part 87. See generally 47 CFR pt. 87. Below, we seek comment on the regulatory treatment of these services, including their placement in the organization of our rules. See, e.g., infra paras. 70-73. 39 References to line-of-sight herein correspond to radio-line-of-sight. This is in contrast to FAA rules, which consider whether UAS operations are within visual-line-of-sight rather than radio-line-of-sight. See 14 CFR  107.31. We focus on whether a UA is beyond-radio-line-of-sight in this context because the suitability of the different licensing approaches we consider below direct link connections as opposed to network-based connections appears to depend to a greater extent on whether an operation is within radio-line-of-sight of the operator than on whether or not an operation is in visual sight of the operator. A UA that is beyond-visual-line-of-sight but within radio-line-of-sight can still be controlled by a direct wireless link between the controllers radio and the UA. 40 See, e.g., CTIA Refresh PN Comments at 11 To the extent this band is to be used for beyond-line-of-sight, the spectrum will either need to be deployed on existing nationwide infrastructure, or brand-new infrastructure that can accommodate UAS flight over long distances.. Such operations have also relied on satellite-based connections or, in some cases, autonomous aircraft that do not require radio control. 481 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 railroad tracks, power distribution infrastructure, or pipelines and long-range surveillance flights.41 We find substantial support in the response to the Refresh Public Notice for both use cases.42 We seek comment on whether any other UAS use cases should be considered in determining the appropriate band plan and service rules. 14. Hereinafter, we use the term Non-Networked Access NNA to indicate spectrum or licenses e.g., NNA blocks that would be governed by service rules appropriate to support non- networked communications.43 Likewise, we use the term Network-Supported Service NSS in connection with spectrum or licenses to indicate that the relevant spectrum or licenses would be governed by service rules appropriate to support the provision of network-based services.44 Further, we propose to use NNA and NSS in the rules to designate the spectrum allocated for non-networked and network- supported use cases, respectively. 15. AIA suggests that RTCAs terminology for these two use cases should be used.45 RTCA uses the term point-to-point for non-networked communications links and the term Command-and- Control Communications Service Providers to describe network-supported services.46 We tentatively find that our proposed terminology is more descriptive of the use cases we seek to support, and that the use of the term point-to-point, which has been long used in Commission rules and orders to reference systems providing a data communication link between two fixed stations, may itself contribute to confusion in this context.47 We seek comment on the proposed terminology, and on alternatives. 16. To accommodate both NNA and NSS in the 5030-5091 MHz band, we propose to partition the band, to dedicate different segments of spectrum in the band for each use case, and to license each of these segments in a manner that is appropriate to support the relevant use cases. We seek comment broadly on the placement of NNA and NSS spectrum to ensure efficient, reliable, and safe use of the band. We seek comment on whether to make spectrum available for multi-purpose uses, e.g., expansion bands for temporary NNA or NSS use. For example, an NSS licensee operating a network in one of the NSS license blocks might request and receive a temporary assignment from a multi-purpose spectrum block to temporarily supplement the network providers spectrum capacity in a particular cell site in order to provide more capacity to an active UAS operation in that cell. We seek comment on our proposals and on alternatives. 17. We specifically propose to dedicate at least 10 megahertz of spectrum for NNA operations, and seek comment on this proposal. AIA and AURA support initially dedicating 10 megahertz for this purpose, and we find no support for dedicating less than 10 megahertz.48 AIA argues that 10 megahertz will be sufficient to promote deployment while preserving the opportunity for an 41 See, e.g., Small UAV Coalition Section 374 Report Comments at 2-4 discussing recent tests and studies involving beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations T-Mobile Section 374 Report Comments at 2 stating that T-Mobile has been selected to work with three state and local departments of transportation to explore how its LTE network can be used to support advanced drone operations, including beyond-visual-line-of-sight flying. 42 See, e.g., AIA Refresh PN Comments at 5 EEI Refresh PN Comments at 5 supporting licensing for beyond- radio-line-of-sight operations L3H Refresh PN Comments at 18 RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 3. 43 We seek comment elsewhere on whether the scope of permitted services should encompass types of communications other than CNPC. 44 Network-supported operations will require a different licensing approach than non-networked access due to the need in the former case to provide the regulatory framework and incentives to support the investment in and deployment of substantial network infrastructure. 45 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 5. 46 See id. at 5. 47 See, e.g., 47 CFR pt. 101, subpts. H, I. 48 See, e.g., AIA Refresh PN Comments at 17 AURA Refresh PN Comments at 6. 482 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 incremental approach to licensing the band that will better accommodate developing industry standards.49 We seek comment on AIAs argument. We seek comment on the placement of the NNA spectrum within the band and whether, consistent with AIAs proposal, we should place 5 megahertz blocks at the bottom 5030-5035 MHz and top 5086-5091 MHz of the band for NNA use. Alternatively, should we locate the dedicated NNA blocks somewhere internal in the band rather than at the band edges? If so, should we designate the spectrum at the edges of the band for NSS? 18. An analysis by RTCA based in part on the use of an online filter-design tool finds that filters that sufficiently protect services in the adjacent bands would necessitate guardbands unusable by terrestrial CNPC at both ends of the 5030-5091 MHz bands, reducing the 61 MHz of usable passband width to 42-52 MHz depending on the case.50 It further states, however, that custom filter designs could probably provide larger usable passbands than those obtained using the online tool, possibly at the cost of increased size and weight.51 We seek comment on this analysis, and whether fixed guard bands at one or both ends of the band are warranted to protect services in the spectrum adjacent to the 5030- 5091 MHz band, including 1 radionavigation-satellite service RNSS downlinks in the 5010-5030 MHz band, 2 aeronautical mobile telemetry AMT downlinks to support flight testing in the 5091-5150 MHz band, and 3 the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System AeroMACS in the 5000-5030 MHz and 5091-5150 MHz bands. Alternatively, does the need to protect adjacent band services argue for dedicating the edge spectrum to something other than NNA assignments, such as satellite?52 Below, we discuss more generally whether any measures beyond appropriate power and out-of-band-emissions limits are needed to protect these adjacent band services. 19. We further seek comment on whether, instead of designating separate upper and lower NNA blocks, we should place all dedicated NNA spectrum together in one contiguous block. Is placement of the NNA spectrum into two or more separate blocks useful for technical or other reasons? Conversely, would providing the spectrum in a single contiguous block reduce interference challenges e.g., by potentially reducing the adjacency of NNA and NSS blocks or better support certain channelizations of the band or important use cases that may require channel bandwidths of more than 5 megahertz? Further, with regard to any technical standards that commenters may recommend applying to services or equipment in the 5030-5091 MHz band, we seek comment on whether these standards require the use of contiguous spectrum.53 20. With regard to the remaining spectrum in the band, we seek comment on how to structure it consistent with the goal of dedicating a segment of spectrum for exclusive use NSS licenses. We seek comment on how much of the spectrum to dedicate for NSS operations, and how we should license any remaining spectrum. For the spectrum that we dedicate to NSS operations, we seek comment on the placement of the NSS blocks and on the appropriate block size for NSS licenses to promote investment and competition and support the current and evolving bandwidth needs of NSS services.54 In the current 49 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 7-8 see also AURA Refresh PN Comments at 8 asserting that 10 megahertz will accomplish the Commissions goal of effectively promoting deployment. 50 RTCA DO-362A, Appx. T at T.5, T.6. 51 Id. at T.6. 52 For example, in its analysis, RTCA asserts that although any guard bands at the edge of the 5030-5091 MHz band would be unusable by terrestrial CNPC links, they could still be used by satellite-based CNPC if a satellite system is built to take advantage of the AMSRS allocation. Id. at T.1. We further discuss the protection of adjacent- band services below. 53 For example, L3H asserts that RTCA DO-362 requires CNPC uplinks or downlinks to operate within a contiguous channel. See L3H Refresh PN Comments at 15. 54 See, e.g., AIA Refresh PN Comments at 17 arguing that frequency band partitioning and channelization schemes should not impede future use of the spectrum by advanced radio technologies. 483 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 record, AIA proposes 5 to 10 megahertz blocks, and Wisk supports 10 megahertz blocks.55 We seek comment on these options and on any other appropriate block sizes. Below, we seek comment on the appropriate scope of permissible services, including whether to restrict communications in the 5030-5091 MHz band to CNPC, or permit transmissions of other types of communications. What size spectrum blocks would be necessary to support CNPC services? What block size would be appropriate if we permit NSS licensees to support non-CNPC communications? Would the flexibility of larger block sizes such as 10 or 20 megahertz better facilitate mixed CNPC and non-CNPC use? 21. While we anticipate that a significant portion of this remaining spectrum would be designated for NSS, we seek comment on whether we should use a portion of the spectrum for opportunistic use by both NNA or NSS licensees multi-purpose use. Should we instead use a portion of the spectrum to increase the amount of spectrum dedicated to NNA operations? To the extent we dedicate spectrum for NSS licenses, we also seek comment on making that spectrum available for NNA operations on an interim, opportunistic basis. Under this approach, NNA users, in addition to having access to dedicated NNA spectrum, could use frequencies in a dedicated NSS block in geographic areas where the NSS licensee has not yet deployed an operating network. Once a network is deployed and operational in a particular area, NNA users would no longer have opportunistic access to the spectrum in that area. This approach would enable the NSS spectrum in an area to be used productively prior to the issuance of NSS licenses and deployment of networks, while providing NSS licensees with complete exclusivity once their systems are deployed. We seek comment on the costs and benefits of this approach, including its technical and economic feasibility, and on alternative approaches to NNA opportunistic access or alternative methods of ensuring productive usage of dedicated NSS spectrum prior to network deployment. 22. With these issues and questions in mind, we seek comment broadly on an appropriate band plan for the 5030-5091 MHz band. As one possible option for structuring the band overall, we invite comment on  Dedicating 10 megahertz of spectrum for NNA operations, with 5 megahertz blocks at the bottom 5030-5035 MHz and top 5086-5091 MHz of the band.  Dedicating 40 megahertz of spectrum for NSS operations, divided into 4 licensed blocks of 10 megahertz each, with NNA opportunistic access as described above.  Making the remaining 11 megahertz available for temporary, opportunistic use by either NNA users or NSS licensees multi-purpose use. This potential option is illustrated in Figure 1 however, we seek comment on alternative band plans including plans that designate the edge spectrum for some purpose other than NNA operations such as for NSS operations or that provide different amounts of spectrum for NNA, NSS, andor multi-purpose use than those presented in the depicted example. 55 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 17 asserting that a 5 megahertz block is sufficient to permit a provider to serve a decent-sized market and provide operational experience controlling out-of-band emissions and in-band interference AURA Refresh PN Comments at 8-9 recommending blocks of at least five megahertz to provide the industry with sufficient bandwidth to tailor internal network requirements and to safety serve a variety of UAS use cases Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 6 supporting 10 megahertz blocks see also Qualcomm Refresh PN Comments at 2 proposing that, for the network mode of UAS communications, the Commission license either four 10.25 megahertz blocks or two 20.5 megahertz blocks. 484 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 23. We further invite comment on alternative approaches to allocating the 5030-5091 MHz band for the support of UAS. For example, AIA proposes that we allocate and license the 51 megahertz between 5035 MHz and 5086 MHz on a geographic area basis in a phased, incremental manner over a period of yearse.g., allocating and licensing only 5 megahertz in the first year, and then licensing additional spectrum over the following years with blocks and geographic areas sized according to user demand and service provider applications.56 AIA suggests that such an incremental approach would help the Commission to accommodate different UAS markets defined by different UAS missions that are expected to emerge over time.57 We seek comment on this possible approach, and more generally on whether we should allocate only a portion of the band at this time and defer allocation of the remainder of the band. We further seek comment on whether we should preserve part of the band at this time for experimental use, or for potential future satellite-based CNPC that relies on the AMSRS allocation in the band. 24. As another alternative, Qualcomm recommends that the Commission allocate 20 megahertz for direct UA-to-UA communications, including communications between the aircraft to facilitate detect and avoid DAA operations, and communications to broadcast Remote ID information.58 56 See Letter from Karina Perez Molina, Director, Unmanned and Emerging Aviation Technologies, Aerospace Industries Association, to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, RM-11798 filed Feb. 1, 2022 AIA Feb. 1, 2022 Ex Parte filing notice of presentation to Ethan Lucarelli, Attach. at 6-7. 57 See Letter from Karina Perez, Director, Unmanned and Emerging Aviation Technologies, Aerospace Industries Association, to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, RM-11798 filed Sept. 14, 2021 AIA Sept. 14, 2021 Ex Parte, at 1 AIA Feb. 1, 2022 Ex Parte, Attach. at 6-7 arguing that a phased implementation preserves large sections of the band for future licensing or use, with the opportunity to open the band to new uses and updated technologies and standards. 58 See Qualcomm Refresh PN Comments at 1. DAA involves a range of still-developing technologies to enable UAS or their operators to detect other aircraft or property and avoid collisions. See, e.g., S. Ramasamy  R. Sabatini, A Novel Approach to Cooperative and Non-Cooperative RPAS Detect-and-Avoid, SAE Technical Paper 2015-01-2470, 1 Sept. 15, 2015, available at httpswww.sae.orgpublicationstechnical-paperscontent2015-01- 2470 last visited Sept. 6, 2022. DAA can rely on transmissions in a variety of ground-based or aircraft-based implementations, for example non-cooperative detection methods such as on-board sensors or cooperative methods that involve the communication between UAS to facilitate cooperative collision avoidance. See id. Remote ID, as required by FAA rules that became effective on April 21, 2021, is the ability of UAS in flight to broadcast identification and location information that can be received by other parties. See FAA, UAS Remote Identification, httpswww.faa.govuasgetting_startedremote_id last visited Sept. 6, 2022. We note that FAA rules currently require Remote ID to be broadcast using devices authorized under the Commissions part 15 rules. See 14 CFR  89.320g. 485 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 Qualcomm proposes that the remaining 41 megahertz of spectrum be licensed in two 20.5 megahertz blocks or four 10.25 megahertz blocks to network providers for the provision of NSS CNPC services and for payload transmissions to the extent that capacity is not needed for CNPC.59 We seek comment on this option and on Qualcomms assertion that supporting the functionalities of DAA and Remote ID broadcasts will require 20 megahertz of 5030-5091 MHz band spectrum.60 We also seek comment on the compatibility of UA-to-UA transmissions and UA broadcast with CNPC links between a ground control station and a UA. If they are not compatible, should a portion of the band be designated exclusively for UA-to-UA or UA broadcast transmissions, and if so, how much spectrum should be designated for this purpose?61 25. We seek comment on whether we should establish any internal guard bands, such as between the NNA and NSS blocks, or whether we can rely on appropriate technical rules to ensure that UAS operations in one block do not cause harmful interference to UAS operations in adjacent spectrum blocks. We request that parties proposing guard bands provide detailed technical justification and specify the width and placement of the proposed guard bands. We further seek comment on whether fixed guard bands at one or both ends of the band are warranted to protect services in the spectrum adjacent to the 5030-5091 MHz band, including 1 radionavigation-satellite service RNSS downlinks in the 5010-5030 MHz band, 2 aeronautical mobile telemetry AMT downlinks to support flight testing in the 5091-5150 MHz band, and 3 the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System AeroMACS in the 5000- 5030 MHz and 5091-5150 MHz bands. Below, we discuss more generally whether any measures beyond appropriate power and out-of-band-emissions limits are needed to protect these adjacent band services. 2. Dynamic Frequency Management System 26. To address the complexities involved in coordinating shared interference-protected access to the 5030-5091 MHz band, we propose that access to the band be managed by one or more dynamic frequency management systems DFMS. We use the term DFMS to describe a frequency coordination system that, in response to requests from UAS operators for frequency assignments in NNA spectrum, would determine and assign to the requesting operator, through an automated non-manual process, temporary use of certain frequencies for a particular geographic area and time period tailored to the operators submitted flight plan. For the duration of the assignment, the operator would have exclusive and protected use of the assigned frequencies within the assigned area and timeframe, after which the frequencies would be available in that area for assignment to another operator. We contemplate that each DFMS would be administered by a private third party, which we refer to as a DFMS administrator. We further contemplate that each system would be capable of coordination-related activities across the entire 5030-5091 MHz band. While we contemplate that NSS licensees would be responsible for the use and coordination of frequencies within the scope of their licenses, requiring a DFMS to be capable of coordination across the entire band would enable a DFMS to provide dynamic access to any portions of the 5030-5091 MHz band that are, in the initial order or subsequently, assigned for NNA use, as well as to implement opportunistic access to portions of the band that are assigned for NSS use as appropriate. We tentatively conclude that these systems could 1 facilitate the efficient and intensive use of a limited spectrum resource for interference-protected CNPC 2 give UAS operators access to reliable CNPC for operations where those communications links are safety-critical 3 enable UAS operators to gain spectrum access in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner 4 enforce compliance with frequency assignments through access controls, checking existing frequency 59 See Qualcomm Refresh PN Comments at 2. 60 See Qualcomm Refresh PN Comments at 8 asserting that 20 megahertz will be needed for broadcasting of detection information by UAVs for remain well clear messaging and collision avoidance, broadcast Remote ID, and potentially other important safety and security use cases. 61 See, e.g., AIA Feb. 1, 2022 Ex Parte, Attach. at 5, 7 suggesting that allocating some portion of the band for UAS vehicle-to-vehicle V2V communications would provide situational awareness for UAS that cannot use ADS-B due to the Remote ID RID rule but that 20 megahertz for V2V would be an oversupply. 486 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 assignments, providing updates in authorized databases, and other mechanisms 5 protect critical communications inside the band and in adjacent spectrum 6 support opportunistic use in unused portions of spectrum sub-bands designated for exclusive use licenses and 7 promote rapid evolution of the use of the band in response to technological, market, or regulatory changes, such as if the Commission deploys spectrum in the band incrementally or, in the future, finds that modifying the access rules in a particular sub-band is in the public interest to better meet market demand. We seek comment on our proposal and its costs and benefits. 27. The record and past Commission experience further lead us to tentatively conclude that the DFMS approach we propose is feasible and practical. The record reflects support from a number of parties for the use of such a system to manage shared access to the 5030-5091 MHz band.62 In addition, the Commission has successfully relied on automated dynamic frequency management systems in other bands, including the Spectrum Access System SAS that was adopted in the 3.55-3.7 GHz band 3.5 GHz band to coordinate spectrum access to the Citizens Broadband Radio Service CBRS, allowing incumbent radar systems, licensed services, and licensed-by-rule services to coexist in the band.63 Several parties in the record state that aspects of the SAS can be leveraged or incorporated in the development and deployment of a DFMS.64 The support in the current record for the use of a DFMS, along with the success of the 3.5 GHz band SAS and the potential to build on the SAS experience and technology, lead us to tentatively conclude that a DFMS solution can feasibly be implemented to enable near-term use of the band with the benefits discussed above. We seek comment on our tentative conclusion, and the extent of interest in providing such DFMS services in the 5030-5091 MHz band. In addition to the specific questions below, what other aspects of the 3.5 GHz band SAS approach would be appropriate here, and what aspects should be changed? How should the Commission supervise the operations of the DFMS? 28. We propose to permit more than one DFMS to operate in the band, each providing access to frequencies nationwide, and to require coordination and communication between them to ensure that the assignments of one DFMS are consistent with the assignments of the others. This approach would provide the benefits of competition to DFMS services, including promoting technological innovation in such services, encouraging responsiveness to market demands through tailored and differentiated services, helping to prevent discriminatory conduct based on potential conflicts of interest, and placing competitive pressure on fees and service quality.65 Further, the use of multiple competitive administrators was successfully implemented in the 3.5 GHz band, where the Commission has, to date, authorized six SASs for full commercial operations in the band.66 We seek comment on this proposal. 29. DFMS requirements and responsibilities. We seek comment on the appropriate regulatory framework to establish for a DFMS, including its requirements and responsibilities and the 62 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 4, 7 AURA Refresh PN Comments at 8 Boeing Refresh PN Comments at 5 DSA Refresh PN Comments at 3 Federated Wireless Refresh PN Comments at 2-3 FPL Refresh PN Comments at 4 L3H Refresh PN Comments at 3 WInnForum Refresh PN Comments at 3-4 Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 3 Xcel Refresh PN Reply at 5. 63 See 47 CFR pt. 96 see also, generally, Amendment of the Commissions Rules with Regard to Commercial Operations in the 3550-3650 MHz Band, GN Docket No. 12-354, Report and Order and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 30 FCC Rcd 3959 2015 3.5 GHz RO. 64 See DSA Refresh PN Comments at 2-3 Federated Wireless Refresh PN Comments at 3-7 WInnForum Refresh PN Comments at 5 see also AIA Refresh PN Comments at 8 stating that the SAS as used in the 3.5 GHz band does not meet all the requirements for aviation use, having been designed for use by fixed, ground-based networks, but finding that some aspects of the concept could be incorporated. 65 See, e.g., 3.5 GHz RO, 30 FCC Rcd at 4063-64, 4066, paras. 354, 357, 366. 66 Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology Approve Four Spectrum Access System Administrators for Full Scale Commercial Deployment in the 3.5 GHz Band and Emphasize Licensee Compliance Obligations in the 3650-3700 MHz Band Under Part 96, GN Docket No. 15-319, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 117, 117, para. 1 WTBOET 2020 certifying CommScope, Federated Wireless, Inc., Google, and Sony, continued. 487 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 requirements and responsibilities of a DFMS administrator. We seek comment on whether and to what extent we can draw on the requirements and responsibilities governing the SAS and SAS administrators in the 3.5 GHz band.67 For example, we seek comment on whether to follow our policy for the 3.5 GHz SASs and establish only the minimum high-level requirements necessary to ensure the effective development and operation of fully functional DFMSs, leaving other requirements to be addressed by the DFMS administrators and multi-stakeholder groups.68 If we follow this policy, what high-level requirements should we establish? Below, we explore in greater detail a potential regulatory framework for DFMSs, and the extent to which aspects of the DFMS requirements and operation should be specified in our rules. 30. One of the most important responsibilities of the DFMS would be to ensure that UAS operators receiving 5030-5091 MHz assignments and operating consistent with their assignments are protected from harmful interference and that they do not cause harmful interference to other protected operations in the band and adjacent bands, including protected federal operations.69 In light of the many challenges of ensuring appropriate protection and reliability for all authorized UAS operations in the band, which could involve highly diverse and evolving operations with different risk profiles, altitudes, flight speeds, and spectrum needs in a shared spectrum environment, and could potentially involve the need for mid-flight alterations to flight plans and other operational complications, we seek comment on whether the Commission should simply establish an appropriate high-level requirement on the DFMS, such as a requirement to provide protected access to spectrum appropriate to cover a submitted and valid request, to the extent such spectrum is available, and defer to the DFMS administrators, or potentially a multi-stakeholder group, to determine the appropriate means of doing so. To the extent the Commission should codify more detailed requirements, we seek comment on all measures the Commission should adopt to facilitate the ability of the DFMS to provide reliable, interference-protected assignments, including any necessary specifications, requirements, responsibilities, authority, processes, or remedies. We further seek comment on the interference mitigation techniques that can be employed by UAs, such as geo-fencing.70 31. At a minimum, we propose to require that a DFMS administrator adopt procedures to immediately respond to requests from Commission staff for information they store or maintain and to Inc. as SAS Administrators Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology Approve Spectrum Access System Administrator Amdocs for Full Scale Commercial Deployment in the 3.5 GHz Band, GN Docket No. 15-319, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 3687, 3687, para. 1 2020 WTBOET certifying Amdocs, Inc. as a SAS Administrator Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology Approve Spectrum Access System Administrator Key Bridge Wireless for Full Scale Commercial Deployment in the 3.5 GHz Band, GN Docket No. 15-319, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 4880, 4880, para. 1 WTBOET 2021 certifying Key Bridge Wireless LLC as a SAS Administrator.

See also, e.g., DSA Refresh PN Comments at 5 recommending that the Commission continue its policy of authorizing multiple commercial dynamic spectrum management system administrators, and asserting that competition among these providers will spur greater innovation and reduce costs. 67 See 47 CFR pt. 96 subpt. F Spectrum Access System see also 3.5 GHz RO, 30 FCC Rcd at  III.H. 68 We discuss a potential role for a multi-stakeholder group in greater detail below. 69 See infra Section II.B.9 seeking comment on measures necessary to protect federal Microwave Landing Systems in the 5030-5091 MHz band and various out-of-band services. 70 Geo-fencing is a technique of defining a virtual geographic boundary defined by coordinates around an area. Depending on the implementation, when a UA approaches the boundary, the UA or its controller could receive a transmission to change course to avoid the area. 488 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 comply with any Commission enforcement instructions they receive, as well as to securely transfer all the information in the DFMS to another approved entity in the event it does not continue as the DFMS Administrator at the end of its term. We seek comment on these proposals. In addition, what requirements should we impose on the DFMS or DFMS administrator with regard to retention of records and information, including registration and assignment records? Should we require retention of all such information for at least five years? What requirements should we adopt to ensure data security in DFMS operations, including the security of end-to-end communications between operators and a DFMS and the security of information stored by a DFMS? 32. What requirements, if any, should be imposed on NNA operators in the band to help ensure the DFMSs ability to provide interference-protected access or to promote more robust or efficient use of the spectrum? Should these requirements be high-level, with additional development through a DFMS administrator or multi-stakeholder group, or should they be more detailed? What information should we require operators to provide to the DFMS regarding ground stations and unmanned aircraft stations? Should that information be provided prior to any requests, with an assignment request, or on an ongoing or periodic basis during an operation? For example, should we require operators to provide ground station geographic location, effective isotropically radiated power EIRP, andor antenna patterns? Assuming a DFMS has the necessary information about the ground station, is information about the location or transmitter characteristics of the UA unnecessary to prevent harmful interference? Should we require an active UAS relying on an NNA assignment in the band to provide a DFMS with the UA information that must be broadcast under the Remote ID rule or some subset or variation of that information?71 Should an operator be required to provide the DFMS specific information about the UA, including its manufacturer, model, or other technical or identifying information? Should an operator be required to affirmatively communicate to the DFMS, in real time or within a certain period of time of the relevant event, the initiation and termination of the flight or, alternatively, the initiation and termination of the operators use of the assigned frequencies? Are there other circumstances or information aside from the request that the operator should be required by rule to communicate to the DFMS? Should any requirements be imposed on UAS operators relying on NSS networks to facilitate the DFMSs ability to provide interference-protected NNA assignments? 33. We further seek comment on whether to mandate that a UAS operator register with a DFMS as a precondition to requesting NNA frequency assignments, and if so, what requirements we should impose with respect to such registration. Should the Commission simply require registration and leave the details to be developed by, for example, the DFMS administrators or a multi-stakeholder group? To the extent the Commission should codify further details, what information should be included with registration? Should UAS operators be required to register ground and UA stations? Should we impose requirements with regard to if and when registration should be updated and, if so, what is the appropriate duration of the initial registration term and the renewal term? Under what circumstances should the Commission or the relevant DFMS administrator revoke a UA operators registration? While we envision that any registration requirements would apply only to operators seeking NNA assignments, we seek comment on whether to require operators relying on a network service in NSS spectrum to register with a DFMS. 34. We also seek comment on what requirements, if any, we should impose with respect to the submission of UAS operator requests for NNA assignments, and conversely what, if any, details of the request process should be left to be developed by a multi-stakeholder group. For example, should we impose specifications of what information should be included in a request, and if so, what data should we require? Should requests include the relevant ground and unmanned aircraft stations that will be used in the operation, and if so, how should these be identified? To the extent we permit mobile ground stations, 71 The FAAs rules for Remote ID require most UAS operating in United States airspace to have Remote ID capability. See Remote ID Rules at 4403-04 49 CFR  89.101. Remote ID capability includes the broadcast of information such as the identity, location, and altitude of a drone in flight, including its control station or take-off location. See 14 CFR  89.305. 489 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 should requests provide a specification of the route of the mobile ground station over time and the times at which the station will reach specific locations in order to enable frequency assignment to consider the range coverage of the station as a function of time? Should we require submission of a flight plan, and if so, what information should the flight plan include, and in what format? For example, should it specify time of use, and flight positions and flight altitude over the course of the flight plan, as suggested by AIA?72 Should an operator be required to submit requests no more than a certain specified time period in advance of a flight?73 35. As a general matter, should a DFMS grant a frequency assignment for the duration and other parameters requested, provided the unassigned spectrum is available to meet the request? Alternatively, should limits or restrictions be placed on what can be granted? For example, should a limit be placed on the maximum duration of an assignment to prevent monopolization of the spectrum by one or a few parties with flights of long or indefinite duration?74 Should a limit be placed on the number of simultaneous temporary frequency assignments allowed by the DFMS to reduce the potential for harmful interference? 36. As several parties have noted, operators may need to revise their assignments after a flight has commenced e.g., where the flight needs to deviate from its anticipated flight path and UAS CNPC transmissions for the revised flight would not be covered by the original assignment, or where a flight takes longer than provided under the assignment. We seek comment on any rules we should adopt to enable or facilitate the filing and timely processing of such requests for revised assignments or to otherwise address an operators mid-flight need for revised assignment. Do we need to adopt any rule to address cases where the revised request cannot be granted consistent with other previously granted assignments? 37. In the 3.5 GHz band, SASs may require fixed stations to implement reassignment to new frequencies, reduction of the permitted transmitting power level, or cessation of operations, as necessary to avoid or eliminate harmful interference and implement spectrum access priorities.75 We note, however, that the 5030-5091 MHz band presents challenges to such an approach that are not present in the 3.5 GHz band. First, whereas the 3.5 GHz stations under SAS control are all fixed stations i.e., stations operating from a fixed location, facilitating a SASs ability to communicate with such stations and determine their location, we seek comment below on permitting UAS ground stations in the NNA portion of the 5030- 5091 MHz band to be mobile stations e.g., hand-held controllers.76 Second, active management of spectrum access during an ongoing UAS operation could introduce significant safety hazards, such as if a DFMS were to require automatic cessation or powering-down of a UAS CNPC link while a flight was ongoing, resulting in a mid-operation loss of control.77 Given such challenges, is an active management 72 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 9. 73 See AIA Petition at 14 indicating that RTCA DO-362 anticipates that requests will be made no more than 20 minutes in advance of a flight. But see RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 4 stating that in some circumstances, requests for channel assignments for flights could be made days in advance. 74 See, e.g., dronelife, Heavy Lift Tethered Drone Flies for a Week Zenith AeroTech Celebrates 108 Hours of Uninterrupted Flight, httpsdronelife.com20210610heavy-lift-tethered-drone-flies-for-a-week-zenith-aerotech- celebrates-108-hours-of-uninterrupted-flight last visited Sept. 6, 2022. 75 See 47 CFR  96.39c2. 76 See infra para. 58  n.112. 77 For this reason, some parties in the record oppose mechanisms that would automatically revoke an assignment after the duration of assignment has expired. See EEI Refresh PN Comments at 8 Frequency assignments should not be revoked during flights because it would create potential safety concerns. L3H Refresh PN Comments at 5-6 suggesting that use of an assignment beyond its duration should be subject to post-flight investigation and enforcement, but that revocation of a frequency channel should never occur during a UAS flight. But see RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 5 stating that automatic revocation of an assignment without confirmation from continued. 490 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 approach feasible and appropriate, and if so, what regulatory requirements should be adopted to enable or implement such an approach? If not feasible, what approaches or mechanisms will be available to the DFMS to ensure the reliability of communications? In particular, given that the proposed assignments would be limited in both frequency, time, and geography, what requirements, procedures, penalties, or other measures should be in place to prevent or address 1 flights that use unauthorized frequencies 2 flights that occur outside an authorized time period, such as a flight that exceeds its authorized duration or 3 flights that occur outside an authorized area. If a DFMSs role is merely to reserve appropriate spectrum for UAS flights, and a DFMS takes no other active measures to ensure or enforce compliance with the assignments or the protection of operations, will spectrum access be sufficiently reliable for mission critical purposes? 38. Fees. Under the 3.5 GHz rules, an SAS administrator is authorized to charge users a reasonable fee for the provision of its services, and the Commission can require changes to those fees if they are found to be unreasonable.78 We propose to adopt a similar provision authorizing the administrator of a DFMS to charge reasonable fees for its provision of services, including registration and channel assignment services, and to permit parties to petition the Commission to review fees and require changes if they are found to be excessive. To encourage efficient use of the limited spectrum resource and discourage any attempt at warehousing, we seek comment on specifically authorizing reasonable usage-based fees, and on standards and approaches for establishing the amounts of such fees. 39. Selection process. We seek comment on the process for selecting the DFMS administrators, and whether the 3.5 GHz SAS approval process could serve as a model.79 Under the approach for SAS approval, the Commission delegated authority to WTB and OET to administer the process and provided that 1 the Bureaus would issue a Public Notice requesting proposals from entities desiring to administer a SAS 2 applicants would be required, at a minimum, to demonstrate how they plan to meet the Commissions rules governing SAS operations, demonstrate their technical qualifications to operate a SAS, and provide any additional information requested by WTB and OET 3 based on these applications, WTB and OET would determine whether to conditionally approve any of the applicants and 4 any applicants that received conditional approval would be required to demonstrate that their SASs meet all the requirements in the rules and any other conditions the Bureaus deemed necessary, and at a minimum, to allow their systems to be tested and analyzed by Commission staff.80 We seek comment on adopting this approach. In particular, we seek comment on facilitating the potential selection of multiple DFMSs through an application and certification process by which any entity found to meet the requirements can be the administrator of such a system, and we seek comment on what eligibility requirements should be set and whether or to what extent they should be codified or established through a separate process. We also seek comment on whether we should provide a testing or trial phase for DFMS technology prior to the submission of applications, to facilitate or inform the requirements of the application process. Following the SAS model, we propose to delegate jointly to WTB and OET the the UAS operator should happen only after the frequency assignment manager has followed documented, disclosed and agreed upon . . . safety procedures. 78 See 47 CFR  96.65a, b. 79 See 3.5 GHz RO, 30 FCC Rcd at 4067, paras. 369-73 see also, e.g., Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology Conditionally Approve Seven Spectrum Access System Administrators for the 3.5 GHz Band, GN Docket No. 15-319, Public Notice, 31 FCC Rcd 13355, 13356-59, paras. 7-10 WTBOET 2016. 80 See 3.5 GHz RO, 30 FCC Rcd at 4067, paras. 371-72 see also 47 CFR  0.241j, 0.331f jointly delegating to the Chiefs of OET and WTB authority to administer the SAS and SAS Administrator functions, and to develop specific methods that will be used to designate SAS Administrators to designate SAS Administrators to develop procedures that these SAS Administrators will use to ensure compliance with the requirements for SAS operation to make determinations regarding the continued acceptability of individual SAS Administrators and to perform other functions as needed for the administration of the SAS. 491 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 authority to administer the selection process and make the selection. We seek comment on what role the FAA and NTIA should have in setting up the process, reviewing applications, and making the selection. 40. Coordination with flight authorization. In addition to spectrum access, i.e., authorization to transmit, UAS operators also need approved or otherwise authorized access from the FAA to conduct flights in the airspace of the United States. For example, under part 107, UAS operators are authorized to fly in uncontrolled airspace below 400 feet above the ground AGL and in accordance with part 107 of the FAAs rules without specific airspace authorization, whereas part 107 flights in controlled airspace generally require a specific airspace authorization from air traffic control.81 Under the UAS Traffic Management UTM program, however, the FAA has been developing a separate ecosystem of requirements, services, and other features to enable the traffic management of low-altitude UAS operations, including systems for automating the flight approval process.82 One result of the program has been the deployment of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability LAANC system, through which UAS operators can apply to LAANC service providers to receive a near real-time airspace authorization for operations under 400 feet in controlled airspace around airports.83 41. We seek comment on whether and how frequency assignments should be coordinated with airspace authorization for low altitude, high altitude, and terminal departurearrival operations. For example, should a DFMS be required to determine that a requesting party has any necessary flight authority as a condition of granting a spectrum assignment request? If so, we seek comment as to whether and how a DFMS would interact with air traffic control or the relevant UTM systems such as LAANC, or otherwise obtain information regarding airspace approvals, authorizations, or availability. 42. Alternative approaches to dynamic spectrum access. We seek comment on other options to enable dynamic spectrum access to the 5030-5091 MHz band. Some parties suggest that we adopt some form of cognitive radio solution, in which UAS radios would directly detect and identify available spectrum channels.84 They argue that a centralized system like the DFMS will be complex and labor intensive to use, will be inefficient in spectrum assignments and vulnerable to spectrum warehousing, and will have difficulty ensuring link protection and responding quickly to developments such as changes in flight plans while a UA is already in flight.85 We seek comment on these concerns and whether they can be addressed by a DFMS, and we seek comment on the feasibility, costs, and benefits of alternative options as compared to the DFMS discussed above, and whether such alternatives would be sufficiently reliable to support even the most safety-critical uses such as flights in controlled airspace. We further seek comment on whether there are existing technologies that could be applied or adapted to implement these alternative approaches, and on any standards work or other studies regarding the safety and reliability of links under such systems. 43. We note that the Commission has, in two cases, adopted a variation of the DFMS approach in which, for a particular device to access the relevant spectrum band, automated and periodic 81 See FAA, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems UA Regulations Part 107, httpswww.faa.govnewsroomsmall- unmanned-aircraft-systems-uas-regulations-part-107 last visited Sept. 6, 2022 stating that part 107 operations in Class G airspace are allowed without air traffic control ATC permission while such operations in Class B, C, D and E airspace need ATC authorization.. 82 See FAA, Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management, httpswww.faa.govuasresearch_developmenttraffic_management last visited Sept. 6, 2022 see also NASA, Aeronautics Research, httpswww.nasa.govutm last visited Sept. 6, 2022. 83 See FAA, UAS Data Exchange LAANC, httpswww.faa.govuasprograms_partnershipsdata_exchange last visited Sept. 6, 2022. 84 See L3H Refresh PN Comments at 13 asserting that cognitive radios would have benefits and are worthy of further consideration SSC Refresh PN Comments at 4-5 proposing a system including multiple types of evidence to determine availability including database query and optional device-based sensing. 85 See, e.g., SSC Refresh PN Comments at 9-11. 492 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 queries of spectrum availability are made to a central database by the device itself. In the 6 GHz band, the Commission adopted a system that allows unlicensed access to temporarily unused portions of the band while protecting incumbent services through a database of incumbent operations that certain unlicensed devices must query to determine available channels for their coverage area.86 Similarly, in the TV bands, the Commission established a TV white space database that is queried by an unlicensed device seeking access to the bands and that authorizes operations only on unused spectrum throughout the unlicensed devices coverage area.87 We seek comment on whether a similar system could be adopted for NNA operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band, under which 5030-5091 MHz radios would be required to directly and periodically query a central database for available channels. Given that the 6 GHz and white space systems are implemented to enable unlicensed devices to access spectrum without interference protection, we seek comment on whether this type of system could be suitable to implement interference protection for UAS NNA operations. Could such a system be implemented in a manner that provides an assignment of protected spectrum that covers all applicable stations in a particular UAS NNA operation e.g., both the operators control station and the associated airborne radio and ensures protected access for the duration of an entire UAS flight plan? Alternatively, could such a device query function be added to the DFMS as a second and optional means of receiving authorization from the DFMS for use cases where such authorization is sufficient? If the Commission adopts rules providing for the establishment of such a system, should we require that the system database be updated in real time with relevant parameters of the NNA systems currently in operation? We further seek comment on whether any such system and any tool used to perform the interference analysis should be certified and approved for use by the Commission andor other appropriate authorities prior to operation. 44. In the event that we adopt rules providing for the establishment and operation of a DFMS or some other coordination system or process, there may be a significant period of time before such coordination system is operational in the band and some operators may want protected access to the band during this interim period. While such operators may currently apply for special temporary authority to use the band, these authorizations do not provide interference protection.88 Accordingly, we seek comment on whether to establish some method by which operators can get temporary protected access to frequencies in the 5030-5091 MHz band, or a portion of the band, during this interim period. Should we provide that parties may apply during this period for licenses comparable to grants of part 5 special temporary authority STA e.g., a duration of no more than 6 months but with rights of interference protection, and subject to pre-application coordination through a frequency coordinator group and to termination in the event a DFMS becomes operational? Should such uses have the same opportunity for renewal as part 5 STAs? Moreover, we seek comment on an interim frequency management process through which parties could obtain limited, short-term access to spectrum, such as access suitable for a single flight or event. 3. Multi-stakeholder Group 45. We seek comment on a possible role for a multi-stakeholder group to help develop the requirements and processes applicable to the DFMSs, as well as to study standards and interference issues associated with UAS operations in the band. There are aviation-specific considerations that may affect how spectrum access should be managed, and it may be beneficial for stakeholders versed in such 86 See Unlicensed Use of the 6 GHz Band et al., ET Docket No. 18-295, et al., Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 35 FCC Rcd 3852 2020 6 GHz RO. 87 See generally 47 CFR pt. 15, subpt. H. See also, generally, Amendment of Part 15 of the Commissions Rules for Unlicensed Operations in the Television Bands, Repurposed 600 MHz Band, 600 MHz Guard Bands and Duplex Gap and Duplex Gap, and Channel 37, et al., ET Docket No. 14-65, et al., Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd 9551 2015. 88 See 47 CFR  1.931b1 Promoting Expanded Opportunities for Radio Experimentation and Market Trials under Part 5 of the Commissions Rules and Streamlining Other Related Rules et al., ET Docket No. 10-236, et al., Report and Order, 28 FCC Rcd 758, 760, para. 3 2013. 493 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 considerations e.g., members of the aviation industry, the UAS standards-making community, frequency managers, and network operators to assist in the development of requirements and processes. In the context of the 3.5 GHz band, the Commission encouraged the informal creation of a multi-stakeholder group to develop various implementation details to facilitate development of CBRS, and this approach proved highly successful.89 This informal reliance on multi-stakeholder group activities has been adopted in other contexts as well, including the implementation of Automated Frequency Coordination AFC systems in the 6 GHz band.90 Further, several parties in the record support a role for a multi-stakeholder group to further develop requirements for the DFMS and the 5030-5091 MHz band, although some advocate the designation of a more formal, governing body to serve in this role.91 We seek comment on whether, consistent with the successful approach in the 3.5 GHz band, we should encourage a multi- stakeholder group to address implementation issues in the 5030-5091 MHz band, but without the Commission formally designating such a group or imposing a formal process for how the group reaches its determinations or recommendations. If such a multi-stakeholder group were to be formed by third parties, what selection procedures might be desirable to ensure that the group appropriately reflects the diversity of UAS stakeholders? What role might federal agency stakeholders have in this process? We seek comment on these and any additional procedures or approaches that a multi-stakeholder group might implement, particularly in light of the positive experience with the 3.5 GHz band stakeholder group. 46. Assuming there is a role for a multi-stakeholder group, we seek comment on the appropriate extent of that role and the responsibilities it might most usefully undertake. We seek comment on the matters a multi-stakeholder group should address with consensus standards or other determinations, or with the development of recommendations to one or more of the stakeholder agencies. We further seek comment on the matters that the Commission should address independently of any multi- stakeholder group and the rules it should adopt to establish a basic regulatory framework to govern the 5030-5091 MHz band and the DFMSs. 89 See 3.5 GHz RO, 30 FCC Rcd at 4081, paras. 416, 417 finding that a multi-stakeholder group could be instrumental in developing answers to some of the novel technical questions raised by the CBRS rules, declining to formally designate a group or adopt a specific process for reviewing and responding to their recommendations, but encouraging any such group to work to share their findings with the Commission and to incorporate their work, to the extent feasible, into the development of the 3.5 GHz band SAS and citizens band radio service devices. To serve as a multi-stakeholder group for this purpose, the Wireless Innovation Forum WInnForum created the Spectrum Sharing Committee, which, inter alia, collaborated with relevant government agencies to develop 10 standards for the 3.5 GHz band addressing a range of CBRS and SAS technical and operational issues. See, e.g., WInnForum Refresh PN Comments at 1-2. 90 See 6 GHz RO, 35 FCC Rcd at 3918-19, paras. 174-80 encouraging the formation of a multi-stakeholder group to provide a forum for the industry to study technical and operational issues raised by 6 GHz band unlicensed access and work cooperatively towards solutions see also Expanding Flexible Use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz Band, GN Docket No. 18-122, Report and Order and Order of Proposed Modification, 35 FCC Rcd 2343, 2467, para. 333 2020. 91 Compare Federated Wireless Refresh PN Comments at 7-8 recommending that the Commission follow the approach taken in the 3.5 GHz band and rely on cross-industry stakeholder groups to develop consensus standards for the performance of a shared access system for the 5030-5091 MHz band, with AIA Refresh PN Comments at 13, 18 recommending that the Commission and FAA jointly authorize an independent governing board to oversee the band, and ASRI Refresh PN Comments at 8 supporting the establishment of a governing body formed from the UAS user community with FAA and Commission participation to oversee the frequency management system. See also L3H Refresh PN Comments at 2, 5-6 proposing that the FCC and FAA collaborate with industry to establish a UAS Spectrum Committee responsible for establishing policies, procedures, and standards for assignment of frequencies and procedures for processing frequency requests, as well as policies and procedures for releasing channels following the end of flight. While AIA proposes establishment of a formal governing body, it also discusses a potential role for standards development organizations to determine standards for such matters as the returning of frequency assignments. See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 10, 13. 494 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 4. Scope of Permissible Services 47. In considering the appropriate scope of services to permit in the band, we begin with the services permitted by the underlying allocation. As discussed above, the Commission added an AMRS allocation in the 5030-5091 MHz band to support UAS communications. AMRS is reserved exclusively for communications relating to the safety and regularity of flight, primarily along national or international civil air routes.92 Consistent with the scope of the allocation and the expressed purpose for its incorporation, we propose to permit only CNPC and to define CNPC as any UAS transmission that is sent to or from the UA component of the UAS and that supports the safety or regularity of the UAs flight.93 We seek comment on these proposals and on alternatives that would be consistent with the allocation and its purpose. Should we alternatively define CNPC to cover any communications to or from a UA other than payload communications, and to define payload as information sent to achieve mission objectives?94 RTCA DO-362A, which provides MOPS for UAS CNPC in the 5030-5091 MHz band, states that payload communications, for purposes of the standard, specifically include communications associated with the UA mission payloads, which do not contain safety-of-flight information, and clarifies that safety-of-flight information is any informationdata sent to or received from the UA that is necessary to ensure the UAS is operatedoperating in a manner that protects people andor property from harm due to unintentional events.95 We seek comment on whether to adopt these or similar terms to define the scope of permissible CNPC. NTIA proposes that we limit the band to a subset of CNPC, specifically communications for the control of the UA and other safety-critical functions, in order to limit UAS use to essential services.96 RTCA DO-362A similarly provides that CNPC includes data and information sent tofrom the Pilot Station and the UA for the control of the UA and other safety-critical functions.97 We seek comment on this option, on the costs and benefits of limiting the band to only the safety- critical communications, on what types of communications would be considered safety-critical, and what, if any, types of non-payload but safety-related communications would not be considered safety- critical. More generally, should we restrict communications to a subset of CNPC? 48. Conceivably, the same data from a UA may be both for the purpose of achieving flight mission objectives and for flight safety-related purposes, for example, video transmissions relied upon both as surveillance data and to assist in flight guidance, or UA telemetry data with respect to local weather conditions such as turbulence and wind shear. We seek comment on whether such dual-purpose communications should be permissible if one of the purposes falls within the permissible scope.98 Would it better serve the public interest to only include communications that are exclusively for purposes of flight safety or regularity? 92 See 47 CFR  2.1, 2.106. 93 See ASRI Refresh PN Comments at 5-6 arguing that band access should be dedicated to UAS safety and regularity of flight communications AURA Refresh PN Comments at 6 Boeing Refresh PN Comments at 8 RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 7 recommending that payload and non-safety or non-route related information should not be sent over systems using this band.. 94 See NTIA Refresh PN Comments at 3 proposing that the scope of services does not include any messages sent to achieve mission payload objectives AIA Refresh PN Comments at 11. 95 See RTCA DO-362A,  1.1. 96 See NTIA Refresh PN Comments at 3 see also L3H Refresh PN Comments at 2 arguing that the Commission should prohibit non-safety-of-life communications in the 5030-5091 MHz band, with the exception of Health  status reports generated by the UAV and sent to the PIC for the sole purpose of ensuring flight reliability and integrity.. 97 RTCA DO-362A, Appx.

We seek comment on whether, instead of a general definition of scope or, potentially, as a clarifying and non-exclusive supplement to a general definition, we should specify certain categories of communications that are covered, such as 1 telecommands to the UA 2 telemetry from the UA that is relied upon for flight guidance or other flight safety-related purposes, such as geo-fencing to protect sensitive areas, i.e., Microwave Landing System sites, radio astronomy sites, adjacent licensees, etc. 3 DAA-related transmissions 4 video transmissions from the UA relied upon for flight guidance or other flight safety-related purposes 5 Air Traffic Control communications relayed via the UA and 6 remote identification transmissions. We seek comment on whether any of these categories should be narrowed, broadened, eliminated, replaced, or supplemented with other categories.99 We seek comment on whether permissible communications should be restricted to communications between the control station and the UA station, i.e., excluding broadcast from the UA or UA-to-UA communications. We further seek comment on whether we should establish priorities among different categories of CNPC, or leave the rules flexible on this matter, with such prioritization potentially to be considered and developed through appropriate standards development by multi-stakeholder groups.100 Commenters should also consider the impact of these potentially covered communications on the capacity of the band, i.e., whether the addition of these categories of communications allows for sufficient spectrum to support the core purpose of the band, CNPC links. 50. We note that the regulatory definition of AMRS limits the allocation to communications relating to safety and regularity of flight, primarily along national or international civil air routes.101 As the allocation does not require that communications be exclusively for flights along such air routes, we propose not to restrict the scope of permissible CNPC services to such communications. We seek comment on this proposal and the extent to which operations outside civil air routes will need access to the 5030-5091 MHz band for CNPC as opposed to being able to rely on other spectrum solutions that may or may not provide the same level of reliability or air safety assurance. Assuming some measure is necessary or appropriate to reflect the focus on flights primarily along national or international civil air routes, we seek comment on whether it would be sufficient to ensure that the applicable rules and technical standards provide the necessary reliability and safety to support the use of the band for such flights. 51. We also seek comment on whether we should restrict NNA to CNPC but permit NSS licensees a broader scope such as a scope permitting UAS payload communications or permitting both UAS and non-UAS communications, provided that licensees ensure the safety and reliability of CNPC and ensure that communications associated with the safety of flight always have both priority and 99 AURA, for example, asserts that categories that can be supported consistent with the AMRS allocation include 1 UAS flight control and configuration messages 2 high priority detect-and-avoid messages, 3 ATC communications 4 flight safety telemetry messages 5 other flight safety messages 7 routine telemetry messages and 7 air traffic services other than ATC communications. See AURA Refresh PN Comments at 6 cf.

E at E.3, Fig. E-2 describing the categories of non-payload internal and external information exchange between a control station and a UA as 1 Aircraft Control telecommands 2 Aircraft Control telemetry 3 Navaids Setting Changes 4 Navaids Display Data 5 ATC Voice Relay 6 Target Data DAA 7 Weather Radar Data 8 Non-Payload Video and 9 C2 Link Management. 100 AIA, for example, describes a prioritization of CNPC under the International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO Annex 10 Volume VI Part I Standards and Recommended Practices SARPs to be applied in both the Forward and Return directions of a C2 Link System. See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 11-12. This scheme prioritizes data as follows 1 UAS flight control and configuration messages 2 high priority DAA messages 3 ATC communications including distress calls and urgency messages 4 flight safety telemetry messages including low priority DAA messages 5 other flight safety messages 6 routine telemetry messages 7 air traffic services other than ATC communications and 8 other communications related to safety and regularity of flight. See id. 101 47 CFR  2.1c emphasis added. 496 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 preemption over other communications.102 We see at least two potential distinctions between NNA and NSS operations that may argue for a broader NSS scope of service. First, NSS operations will require deployment of networks that will necessitate a very substantial investment, in contrast to NNA operations that can occur without any network deployment. We seek comment on whether permitting a broader scope of services is necessary to provide adequate financial incentives to support network buildout in NSS spectrum. Second, network technologies may be better positioned than direct-link systems to implement a successful prioritization of CNPC. We seek comment on this possibility, and to what extent current or developing network technologies or architectures are capable of ensuring the safety and priority of CNPC information over that associated with other traffic and whether these technologies or architectures will be compatible with other authorized operations in the band andor with the TDD requirements of RTCA DO-362A. We seek comment on whether such an expansion of scope would be permissible under section 303y of the Communications Act, which places certain limits on the Commissions authority to allocate electromagnetic spectrum so as to provide flexibility of use.103 52. If we conclude that NSS licensees should be permitted a broader scope of permissible communications on an ancillary basis, we seek comment on adding an appropriate allocation if necessary, on what type of allocation should be adopted to support the broader scope, on whether to subject the allocation to secondary status under the AMRS allocation and to the limitations applicable to the AMRS allocation, and on any measures we should adopt to ensure that the primary use of the spectrum is for CNPC. Should we rely on appropriate multi-stakeholder groups to develop the details of requirements to implement prioritization and preemption? Should any mechanisms for implementing preemption and prioritization be subject to specific review and approval by the Commission, the FAA, andor an appropriate third-party group? 5. Eligibility Restrictions 53. We propose that any entity be eligible to obtain a 5030-5091 MHz NSS license other than those precluded by section 310 of the Communications Act and those that are barred under 47 U.S.C.  1404 from participating in auctions.104 We seek comment on this proposal and whether eligibility should be more restricted. We further seek comment on how, in this context, we interpret section 310b, which imposes restrictions on who can hold or be granted a broadcast or common carrier or aeronautical en route or aeronautical fixed radio station license.105 Under the various authorization proposals discussed herein, would a licensee be considered as holding a common carrier, aeronautical en route or 102 The standard document RTCA DO-377A appears to endorse further consideration, to the extent permitted under the relevant spectrum allocation, of permitting networks as opposed to direct links to provide both CNPC and payload if the relevant spectrum allocations support both, stating that if a UAS designer selects . . . a a C2 Link System architecture that relies on external entities to provide the communication link, e.g., networked terrestrial radios or SATCOM and b there is sufficient bandwidth in the link, it may be beneficial to use a single link to transmit both C2 and payload information provided that the link is able to ensure the safety and priority of C2 information over that associated with the payloads. See RTCA, Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards for C2 Link Systems Supporting Operations of Unmanned Aircraft Systems in U.S. Airspace, RTCA DO- 377A 2021 RTCA DO-377A, Appx.

Specifically, the provision provides that the Commission has authority to allocate electromagnetic spectrum so as to provide flexibility of use if 1 such use is consistent with international agreements to which the United States is a party 2 such use would not deter investment in communications services and systems, or technology development and 3 such use would not result in harmful interference among users. Id. 104 See 47 U.S.C.  310 id.  1404 see also 47 CFR  96.5 applying similar restrictions to Priority Access Licensees in the 3.5 GHz band. 105 See 47 U.S.C.  310b. Section 310b provides that these types of licenses may not be granted to or held by aliens, representatives of aliens, foreign corporations or corporations with specified levels of foreign ownership. Id. 497 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 aeronautical fixed radio station license?106 If so, how should we evaluate any foreign-ownership holdings? 54. We also seek comment on whether to provide that any entity is eligible to operate NNA stations using assignments from a DFMS other than those precluded by section 310 from holding station licenses. Given our proposal elsewhere to license NNA stations by rule, we seek comment on whether section 310 ownership restrictions, which apply to station licenses, apply to operators of stations licensed by rule. We further seek comment, if section 310 does not apply to operators of licensed-by-rule stations, on whether NNA station operators, or the parties receiving assignments from a DFMS for such operation, should be subject to eligibility restrictions comparable to those imposed by section 310 on station licensees. 55. NTIA recommends that, to be eligible for a license for 5030-5091 MHz UAS operations, an applicant be required to certify that it has the requisite FAA remote pilot certification or, in the case of an organization, to certify that it will only utilize individuals with this qualification for its UAS operations in the band.107 Compliance by 5030-5091 MHz operators with applicable FAA remote pilot regulations will be critical to the safe operation of UAS in the 5030-5091 MHz band, and we seek comment on the best approach to achieve this goal, and on NTIAs proposal as one option. To the extent that we adopt a licensed-by-rule model for NNA as proposed, however, UAS operators will not be required to submit individual license applications, and accordingly, there will be no individual license applications in which UAS operators could make the proposed certifications.108 Further, provision of network-based NSS would likely involve a network providers provision of CNPC services to other entities, and thus, it is likely the relevant UAS operator will be neither a licensee nor an employee of a licensee. Accordingly, we seek comment on whether requiring license applicants to certify that they have the requisite FAA remote pilot certification or will utilize operators with such qualifications is a practical option in either the NNA or NSS context. 56. We further seek comment on the costs and benefits of conditioning either NNA or NSS eligibility on a certification that the party has the necessary FAA remote pilot certification or compliance with other FAA requirements. We seek comment on whether it provides a significant regulatory benefit to specifically limit eligibility in this manner, given that UAS operators using 5030-5091 MHz spectrum will in any case be subject directly to FAA rules and enforcement and would not be able to lawfully operate unless they comply with all applicable FAA requirements. We also seek comment on any administrative concerns from having the Commission potentially be required to interpret and enforce the regulatory regime of another agency. Although Boeing supports such incorporation, it notes that the FAA is still working to develop a remote pilot certification program for operators of large UAS.109 CTIA similarly notes that FAA rules and regulations are evolving and it is unclear at this juncture what kind of certification, if any, the FAA will require for different types of UAS users.110 Does the varied and evolving nature of these requirements further argue against importing them into the Commissions licensing regime? 106 47 U.S.C.  310b. 107 See NTIA Refresh PN Comments at 3 see also, e.g., EEI Refresh PN Comments at 5-6 arguing that, to address public safety and security issues, the licensing framework should ensure that individual operators of CNPC links are properly qualified Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 3 arguing that license eligibility should be conditioned on operators ability to meet FAA safety and performance requirements. 108 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 6 arguing against license eligibility requirements if stations will be licensed by rule see also Boeing Refresh PN Comments at 5 arguing that a license applicant certification that they have the requisite FAA remote pilot certification would be a helpful precaution only to the extent the Commission proposes a licensing model that includes individual licensing of UAS operators. 109 Boeing Refresh PN Comments at 5. 110 CTIA Refresh PN Comments at 8. 498 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 57. To the extent that there should be some mechanism in addition to the FAAs enforcement authority to adequately ensure that use of the 5030-5091 MHz band will be consistent with FAA requirements, we seek comment on whether we can instead rely on the DFMS and NSS licensees to ensure that UAS operators have the necessary FAA approvals. For example, to address NNA users, users registering with a DFMS could be required to make the requisite certification as a condition of registration. Alternatively, we might impose a more general requirement on a DFMS to adopt measures that reasonably ensure that operators have the requisite FAA remote pilot authority, and defer to the DFMS administrator or a multi-stakeholder group on specific mechanisms to implement this requirement. We seek comment on these and other alternatives. 6. Non-Networked Access NNA Service Rules 58. Licensing rules. We seek comment on the licensing regime or mechanism we should adopt to enable authorization of NNA operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band and the costs and benefits of any proposed approach. Because we anticipate a large number of operators seeking temporary use of the band, with an even greater number of ground and aircraft stations, we propose to reduce the administrative burdens on such operators and the Commission by adopting a licensing approach that would not require individual licensing of these numerous operators andor stations. Specifically, we propose to implement a licensed-by-rule authorization for aircraft and ground stations in the band, as recommended by AIA and others.111 Under this framework, operators would not be required to apply for individual spectrum licenses for themselves or their mobile or ground stations in order to conduct NNA operations in the band. Instead, parties using rule-compliant stations and operating in compliance with the rules would only need to obtain the requisite temporary frequency assignment from the DFMS in order to transmit in the band in the requested location, frequency, and timeframe. We further propose to permit the stations used by the operator on the ground to send and receive signals to the UA to be either fixed stations or mobile stations such as hand-held controllers.112 We seek comment, however, on whether to require all NNA ground stations in the band to be fixed stations, and on the costs and benefits of permitting the use of mobile ground stations. To what extent would prohibiting such stations facilitate coordination in the NNA portion of the band, or reduce the likelihood of harmful interference, failures to comply with assignments, or challenges with administering or policing the system? If we do not permit mobile ground stations, should we differentiate portable stations, i.e., stations that can be moved but are not intended to be used while in motion? 59. Section 307e of the Act authorizes the Commission to adopt a licensed-by-rule approach for certain specific categories of services, including the citizens band radio service, and also expressly delegates to the Commission the discretion to define the scope of the term citizens band radio service.113 In the Commissions rules, the citizens band radio service is defined as any radio service or other specific classification of radio stations used primarily for wireless telecommunications for which the FCC has determined that it serves the public interest, convenience and necessity to authorize by rule the operation of radio stations in that service or class, without individual licenses, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 111 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 5-6 proposing a framework under which the pilotoperator would not be the spectrum license holder and stations would be licensed by rule to use channels assigned on a flight-by-flight basis id. at 13 Qualcomm Refresh PN Comments at 8 Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 3. 112 As used in this NPRM, the term mobile station refers to a station intended to be used while in motion or during halts at unspecified points. 47 CFR  87.5 mobile service accord 47 CFR  2.1 defining mobile station as a station in the mobile service intended to be used while in motion or during halts at unspecified points see 47 U.S.C.  15334 The term mobile station means a radio-communication station capable of being moved and which ordinarily does move.. 113 47 U.S.C.  307e1, e3. The authority provides an exception to the statutory requirement under section 308 of the Act that, aside from cases of emergencies, the Commission may grant station licenses only upon written application . . . . Id.  308a. 499 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 307e1.114 Pursuant to this authority, the Commission has provided for licensing by rule of an array of services through inclusion in the citizens band radio service, including the Family Radio Service, the Low Power Radio Service, the Medical Device Radiocommunication Service, the Wireless Medical Telemetry Service, the Dedicated Short-Range Communications Service On-Board Units, and the Part 96 General Authorized Access tier of the 3.5 GHz band.115 We tentatively find that licensing by rule of NNA stations would serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity, and accordingly, we propose to implement licensing by rule by including NNA within the scope of the citizens band radio service.116 We seek comment on our tentative conclusion and proposal, on the scope of our authority under Section 307e to adopt a licensed-by-rule approach to UAS operations, and on alternative licensing approaches we might adopt that would not require individual licensing of operators or stations in the band. 60. Section 307e1 also expressly authorizes licensing by rule in the aviation radio service for aircraft stations but does not provide an equivalent grant of authority to adopt licensing by rule for aviation service ground stations.117 We seek comment on whether we nevertheless have authority in this case to adopt licensing by rule for both aircraft and ground stations in the aviation service. Section 307e3 provides the Commission authority to define aircraft station for purposes of section 307e. We seek comment on whether this provision provides us the authority to define aircraft station to include UAS ground stations and whether such an action would serve the public interest. 61. Technical requirements. We seek comment on appropriate technical requirements to govern 5030-5091 MHz NNA equipment and operations. In the current record, NTIA, AIA, and many other parties support adoption of the technical requirements in the RTCA DO-362A standard for this purpose.118 RTCA DO-362A contains Minimum Operational Performance Standards MOPS for terrestrial-based i.e., non-satellite CNPC point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links in the 5030-5091 MHz band, including power limits, emission limits, and frequency accuracy requirements.119 The FAA recently issued a Technical Standard Order TSO establishing minimum performance standards in the 5030-5091 MHz band based on requirements in RTCA DO-362A.120 Accordingly, and in consideration of the current record, we propose to adopt the RTCA DO-362A standard or technical requirements based on that standard to govern NNA equipment and operations and seek comment on this proposal.121 We 114 47 CFR  95.303. 115 See 3.5 GHz RO, 30 FCC Rcd at 4011, paras. 159-61. 116 We note that, while most services that fall under the citizens band radio service category are included in part 95 of the Commissions rules, the rules for 3.5 GHz General Authorized Access GAA stations, which are licensed by rule, are located in part 96. See 47 CFR  96.1b. 117 47 U.S.C.  307e1. 118 See NTIA Refresh PN Comments at 2 see also AIA Refresh PN Comments at 10-11 ASRI Refresh PN Comments at 5-6 Boeing Refresh PN Comments at 2, 6 NUAIR Refresh PN Comments at 1 Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 2. 119 See RTCA DO-362A  1.1, 1.1.2, 1.4 see also id. at Executive Summary. Formally, RTCA DO-362A provides the standards for CNPC Link Systems, which are defined as the combination of airborne and ground UAS radios, antennas, and cabling between them that support the data and information exchanges between the UA and the control station for the purposes of managing and controlling the flight and operation of a UA. Id.  1.4, 1.9. 120 See TSO-C213a see also supra n.19 Boeing Refresh PN Comments at 6 stating that radios that comply with FAA Technical Standard Order . . . requirements, likely based on RTCA DO-362, will be necessary to ensure aviation safety under the AMRS service.. 121 See RTCA DO-362A. We note that RTCA SC-228 has been working on a revision of the standard, to be designated DO-362B. See RTCA Special Committee 228, Terms of Reference, Minimum Performance Standards for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, 5 June 23, 2022, httpswww.rtca.orgwp-contentuploads202206SC-228-TOR- Rev-15-Approved-2022-06-23.pdf SC-228 June 2022 Terms of Reference. Below, we seek comment on streamlining the process by which the Commissions rules can be updated to reflect such a revision. See infra para. 74. 500 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 seek comment on the adequacy of the RTCA DO-362A specified equipment and operational performance requirements, including both transmitter power and receiver input power, and required minimum coupling loss separation distance between ground and airborne CNPC radios and emissions from other licensed radio services.122 62. We seek comment on an appropriate measure of CNPC link reliability to assess RTCA DO-362A and other standards, on the specific anticipated level of CNPC link reliability through radios compliant with the RTCA DO-362A standard, and on any available data that confirms that reliability. We note that some parties have already constructed 5030-5091 MHz UAS radios compliant with RTCA DO- 362 and some have also obtained experimental license authorization from the Commission for their operation in the 5030-5091 MHz band.123 We seek comment on any current or past operation of equipment compliant with RTCA DO-362 or RTCA DO-362A, on the results of any such operations, and on the extent to which they support or raise issues or concerns about incorporation of the standard as the governing technical framework for the 5030-5091 MHz band. We also seek comment on whether parties have deployed experimental UAS equipment in the 5030-5091 MHz band in reliance on any other technical standard. Is there any benefit to requiring formal experimental trials or testing for 5030-5091 MHz band equipment? 63. We also seek comment on any costs or disadvantages in imposing the RTCA DO-362A standard. For example, we seek comment on whether and to what extent imposition of this standard may limit the scope of UAS operations that can make use of links in the band. We also seek comment on whether any such limitations are a result of hard constraints codified in the standard on the scope of UAS operations that may occur consistent with the standard specifications, or instead are a consequence of practical constraints, such as if the standard requires the development and installation of radio equipment that may be too heavy for some UA to carry. For example, the standard provides the standards for CNPC Link Systems, which are limited to communications between a UA and a control station.124 We seek comment on whether application of the standard to the band would preclude use of the band for UA-to- UA or broadcast transmissions for purposes such as DAA or Remote ID. Or would transmissions such as Remote ID broadcasts be compatible with communications between ground stations and aircraft so long as the broadcast transmissions complied with the requirements of section 2.2.1 of RTCA DO-362A that are applicable to aircraft stations?125 Some have also asserted that application of the standard may restrict permissible operations to flights transitioning in and out of Class A airspace.126 We seek comment on the extent to which requiring compliance with RTCA DO-362A would strictly or effectively limit operations in this manner. 64. Canada states that some technical incompatibilities have been identified between RTCA DO-362A and a proposed standard by the European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment 122 We note that the Commission has recently issued a Notice of Inquiry regarding potential measures that may promote improvements in receiver performance. See Promoting Efficient Use of Spectrum through Improved Receiver Interference Immunity Performance, ET Docket No. 22-137, Notice of Inquiry, FCC 22-29 Apr. 21, 2022. Comments regarding UAS-related receiver performance may also be submitted in that docket. 123 See, e.g., L3H Refresh PN Comments at 7 stating that certain requirements of the standard were successfully demonstrated in prototype CNPC C Band radios uAvionix Refresh PN Comments at 1 stating that uAvionix has obtained experimental licenses for 5030-5091 MHz band radio development in two locations, Bigfork, Montana, and Grand Forks, North Dakota, and that as of October 12, 2021 flight tests had already begun at Bigfork using radios designed to comply with RTCA DO-362A. 124 See RTCA DO-362A,  1.2 This CNPC Link System MOPS document addresses only the CNPC Link System, which is part of a larger system that seeks to exchange information between a UA and its Control Station. 125 See RTCA DO-362A,  2.2.1. 126 See CTIA AIA Petition Comments at 9. Class A airspace is the airspace from 18,000 feet mean sea level MSL up to and including flight level FL 600.

If revisions to RTCA DO-362A are necessary or appropriate to address these issues, we seek comment on whether the next version of the standard is anticipated to be backwardly compatible with RTCA DO-362A, and if not, whether adoption of final rules should be deferred until these issues are resolved in a new version of the standard. We seek comment on whether any coordination or other requirements are necessary to ensure adequate protection of foreign satellite-based CNPC services in the band, particularly insofar as they may operate near United States jurisdictional boundaries. We also note that footnote 5.443C of the Table of Frequency Allocations limits the use of the 5030-5091 MHz band to internationally standardized aeronautical systems.130 We seek comment on whether this provision requires the Commission to adopt a standard that is compatible with the EUROCAE standard, and whether RTCA DO-362A would meet our obligations under footnote 5.443C. 65. If we incorporate the RTCA DO-362A standard into our rules, we seek comment on whether to do so through adoption of a general requirement that, to be certified for use under or operated under the NNA rules, all radio equipment must comply with the requirements of RTCA DO-362A, rather than to separately incorporate the various technical requirements of RTCA DO-362A e.g., power, frequency stability, and emission limitations into the service rules.131 If we adopt a general requirement to comply with RTCA DO-362A, we propose to also separately codify requirements for power and emission bandwidth based on the RTCA DO-362A standard, to provide clarity and ease of reference in the rules.132 If, alternatively, we do not have a requirement of general compliance with RTCA DO-362A, but require compliance with only selected provisions of the standard, which provisions or requirements from RTCA DO-362A should we impose? Which specific provisions of RTCA DO-362A are necessary for compatible use of the 5030-5091 MHz band? Should the Commissions technical framework require compliance more broadly with section 2, the Equipment Performance Requirements and Test Procedures 127 See Canada Refresh PN Comments at 1 see also EUROCAE Open Consultation, ED-265, httpswww.eurocae.netnewsposts2019mayeurocae-open-consultation-ed-265 last visited Sept. 6, 2022. 128 While Canada does not describe the nature of the incompatibility to which it refers, and no other commenter discusses incompatibilities between the RTCA DO-362A standard and the EUROCAE standard, discussions before ICAO have focused on the difference in TDD time frames between the two standards RTCA DO-362A terrestrial links relies on a 50 ms time frame to minimize latency, while the satellite-based links under ED-265 would use a 300 ms time frame.

RTCA states that emission limit requirements should also require equipment compliance with the 50 ms Time Division Duplex TDD requirements specified under section 2.2.1.3 of the standard.135 It asserts that use of non-TDD systems or TDD systems with different time length frames operating in the 5030-5091 MHz band within the same radio horizon as RTCA DO-362A compliant equipment will cause unacceptable levels of interference.136 We seek comment on RTCAs assertion and recommendation, and whether adoption of the standard for NNA will necessarily require all equipment in the band, including equipment in neighboring NSS blocks, to use RTCA DO-362A compliant TDD equipment to avoid harmful interference to NNA operations. 67. We seek comment on whether any of the general technical requirements in subpart D of part 87 should apply to NNA equipment. NTIA proposes, for example, that in addition to meeting the out-of-band emissions limits in RTCA DO-362A, we should also require equipment to meet the out-of- band emissions limit specified in section 87.139c.137 RTCA argues, however, that the current requirements of section 87.139c are less stringent than those in RTCA DO-362A, and that the Commission should just require compliance with the latter.138 L3H asserts that it is not clear whether section 87.139 is applicable, as it applies only to communications using certain specific Emissions Designators and the RTCA DO-362A mandatory modulation makes no reference to these designators.139 We seek comment on NTIAs proposal, on whether section 87.139c may, under its existing terms, apply to UAS communications anticipated in the 5030-5091 MHz band, and whether such application is in the public interest. We further seek comment on whether we need to specify authorized emission classes and 133 See RTCA DO-362A,  2, 3. Section 3 requirements are imposed out of recognition that some CNPC Link System attributes and performance may be affected by factors resulting from integration into the UAS.

RTCA flags the section 2.2.1.6 power and emission limits stating that these requirements have been made more stringent than in the original RTCA DO-362 standard but recommends we require compliance with transmitter EIRP and EIRP spectral density emissions requirements under section 3.2.1.42.

Section 87.139c of the Commissions rules provides that for aircraft station transmitters first installed after February 1, 1983, and for aeronautical station transmitters in use after February 1, 1983, and using H2B, H3E, J3E, J7B or J9W, the peak envelope power of any emissions must be attenuated below the peak envelope power of the transmitter pX as follows 1 When the frequency is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 150 percent of the authorized bandwidth of 3.0 kHz, the attenuation must be at least 30 dB. 2 When the frequency is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 150 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth of 3.0 kHz, the attenuation must be at least 38 dB. 3 When the frequency is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth of 3.0 kHz for aircraft transmitters the attenuation must be at least 43 dB.

We seek comment on any other requirements we should impose on NNA equipment. For example, what requirements should we adopt to facilitate a DFMSs ability to communicate with or otherwise control such equipment in the execution of the DFMSs responsibilities? Should equipment be required to enable the DFMS to make direct machine-to-machine frequency assignments to the UAS equipment, in order to ensure that assignments are accurately programmed? Should this capability be available at all times, or only pre-flight? To the extent DFMS communications or control signals are intended to affect operating parameters of the UA, should such communications or control signals be required to occur exclusively through communications between the DFMS and the relevant ground control station or stations, rather than through direct communications with a UA station? In the 3.5 GHz band, fixed stations must respond automatically to SAS directions to modify certain operational parameters such as frequency or power limit.143 Should requirements be adopted for NNA equipment to provide the DFMS with similar control? We further seek comment on whether to impose requirements to ensure interoperability between NNA and NSS network services. Potentially, UA flights that initially rely on a network service may extend into areas where no network has been deployed. What requirements, if any, should we adopt to facilitate operations that can seamlessly switch between network service for CNPC and NNA assignments for that purpose? 69. We note that RTCA has also adopted another standard applicable to CNPC in the 5030- 5091 MHz band, designated RTCA DO-377A, Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards for C2 Link Systems Supporting Operations of Unmanned Aircraft Systems in U.S. Airspace RTCA DO-377A.144 Whereas RTCA DO-362A describes minimum performance standards for the ground and airborne radios used for a direct link, focusing on certain design characteristics of these radios such as power and emissions limits, RTCA DO-377A describes the minimum performance of an overall C2 Link System, defined as a system used to send information exchanges between a control station and an unmanned aircraft and to manage the connection between them, and which can be comprised of one or many AirGround links and GroundGround links.145 RTCA DO-377A can be applied to systems relying on a direct connection or systems relying on network functionality for the connection, and focuses on system requirements, including system performance, safety, and security requirements.146 To the extent that RTCA DO-377A applies to NNA operations, we seek comment on whether we should adopt rules 140 See 47 CFR  87.131. 141 See 47 CFR  87.137 providing the assignable emissions for part 87 services and corresponding emission designators and authorized bandwidths. 142 See 47 CFR  2.201 see also Appx. A,  88.105. 143 See 47 CFR  96.39c2. 144 See RTCA DO-377A. Like RTCA DO-362A, RTCA DO-377A is a revision of the original version of the standard, RTCA DO-377. 145 See RTCA DO-377A,  1.2, 3.2.1. 146 See, e.g., RTCA DO-377A at 1.1.2. Although it appears that RTCA DO-377As performance standards can be applied to any C2 Link System, we note that commenters in this proceeding have generally described the requirements of RTCA DO-377A in the context of network-based CNPC. See, e.g., AIA Refresh PN Comments at 6 asserting that network providers of CNPC must meet aviation performance levels and the safety requirements in DO-377A that govern a proposed network of ground stations and services id. at 8 stating that RTCA DO-377A guides the implementation of ground networks uAvionix Refresh PN Comments at 1 Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 2 n.5 DO-377A provides a basis for the safety, performance, and security standards that a CNPC network should meet . . . .. 504 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 requiring compliance with the standard.147 Alternatively, should we limit our requirements, as AIA recommends, to technical requirements based on RTCA DO-362A and leave system performance, safety, and security requirements, such as those in RTCA DO-377A, to be considered by a multi-stakeholder group or addressed by the FAA?148 70. Application of Part 87 Aviation Service Rules and Part 1 Wireless Radio Service Rules. We seek comment on where to locate the new NNA services rules within the organization of the Commissions rules. Some parties argue that the new service should be located in part 87,149 which states the conditions under which radio stations may be licensed and used in the aviation services.150 We seek comment on this option. We note, however, that the new services may not entirely fit within the scope of aviation services, which are defined as radio-communication services for the operation of aircraft.151 For example, we seek comment above on whether to permit non-CNPC traffic, such as payload communications, which would be communications to achieve mission objectives and not for the operation of aircraft. In addition, it may be appropriate to locate the new NNA and NSS service rules together, and we anticipate that NSS licenses will differ from traditional aviation services in a number of other ways. For example, unlike licenses in traditional aviation services, we anticipate that NSS licenses will provide exclusive rights to spectrum.152 Further, we expect that NSS licenses will be used for the provision of commercial wireless network services and will therefore raise a number of issues more comparable to those involved in the regulation of commercial network services than the regulation of traditional aviation services, such as considerations of promoting service competition and network build- out, as well as possible license auction issues. In addition, the current part 87 rules were not adopted with UAS in mind, and many of the rules in part 87, even in sections otherwise generally applicable to part 87 services, may be unnecessary or inappropriate to apply to UAS communications or to the 5030-5091 MHz services specifically.153 Locating the rules in a new rule part may therefore provide greater clarity and ease of reference in determining the rules applicable to the band. Finally, locating the rules for the 5030- 5091 MHz band in a new rule part would not be inconsistent with its allocation for AMRS. Whether or not the rules are in part 87, the band will remain protected aviation spectrum allocated for AMRS and rules under this allocation can be adopted to achieve the safety and reliability appropriate for 147 While we do not anticipate that wide-area networks will be deployed in reliance on NNA assignments because of the highly transient nature of the relevant spectrum rights, we do not propose to prohibit operators from using their temporary assignments with fixed network infrastructure. Potentially, parties might use these transient spectrum rights in connection with limited infrastructure deployment, such as a string of ground stations deployed over a particular and frequently used flight path. We invite commenters to discuss whether and to what extent the minimum performance standards of RTCA DO-377A would apply in such cases. 148 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 8, 13-14 advocating that the basis of initial service rules should be found in RTCA DO-362A and aviation-specific requirements based on DO-377A should be developed by members of the UAS standards-making community WInnForum Refresh PN Comments at 3 advocating that the Commission establish rules with the minimum necessary technical restrictions to provide adequate protection against harmful interference. Above, we address in further detail the potential reliance on a multi-stakeholder group to further develop recommendations or standards for DFMS and CNPC operation in the 5030-5091 MHz band. 149 See, e.g., AIA Petition at ii. 150 47 CFR  87.1b. 151 47 CFR  87.5. 152 See 47 CFR  87.41b providing that frequencies are available for part 87 aviation services on a shared basis only and will not be assigned for the exclusive use of any licensee. 153 See, e.g., CTIA AIA Petition Comments at 15 arguing that part 87 rules were designed for manned aircraft, that there are critical differences among manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft, including different risk considerations, that regulations for each should be appropriate, and that a new rule part for UAS would be more workable than attempting to retrofit rules intended for manned aviation to accommodate UAS. emphasis in original. We seek comment below on the extent to which the substance of specific part 87 requirements should be applied to NNA operations. 505 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 communications relating to the safety and regularity of flight, regardless of where the rules are located.154 Accordingly, we seek comment on whether we should locate the new UAS rules in a new rule part rather than in part 87, as reflected in Appendix A.155 We further seek comment on alternative options for the appropriate home for the new rules. 71. Whether we locate the rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band in part 87, a new rule part, or elsewhere, we seek comment on whether and to what extent the generally applicable rules in subparts B through F of part 87 should apply to or be incorporated into the new NNA service, either in their current form or with modifications.156 We ask commenters that argue for application of these general part 87 rules to be specific as to which provisions they recommend should be applied, and what, if any, modifications they propose. We anticipate that many of these provisions will be unnecessary, superseded, or otherwise inappropriate as a result of the specific requirements we adopt for the new service. For example, section 87.41 Frequencies in subpart B provides rules for the request and coordination of specific frequencies. Given the proposal for frequency management by a DFMS, is this provision entirely superseded, or is there an aspect of this provision that should apply to NNA assignments? 72. As another example, section 87.89 requires that, with certain exceptions, operators of licensed aviation service stations must hold a commercial radio operator license or permit.157 The operator license requirement is distinct from and wholly independent of the requirement that each station be licensed and requires individuals seeking an operator license to demonstrate, by passing a formal examination, sufficient knowledge of the relevant radio technologies.158 The operator license requirement stems from section 318 of the Act, which requires operators of transmitting equipment of licensed stations to hold an operators license, except where the Commission finds that the public interest, convenience, or necessity will be served by waiving such requirement.159 Some parties in the record have suggested that the Commission adopt operator license requirements for all UAS operators that use 5030-5091 MHz radio equipment, or at least impose the equivalent knowledge requirements on such operators.160 Others have argued against such a requirement. For example, some assert that the Commission should defer to the FAA as the expert agency over aircraft pilot qualifications and rely on the FAAs regulations establishing the testing and certification of UAS operators instead of establishing its own UAS operator licensing or 154 See 47 CFR  2.1 definition of AMRS. 155 See supra Appx. A. 156 See 47 CFR pt. 87, subpts. B Applications and Licenses, C Operating Requirements and Procedures, D Technical Requirements, E Frequencies, F Aircraft Stations. Above, we discuss in greater detail possible technical requirements, including possible application of the general part 87 technical provisions in subpart D. 157 47 CFR  87.89a see also FCC, Commercial Radio Operator License Program, httpswww.fcc.govcommercial-radio-operator-license-program last visited Sept. 6, 2022 FCC rules require that licensees of aviation service stations permit only persons holding the appropriate FCC-issued commercial operator license to perform specified transmitter operation, maintenance and repair duties.. We note that this part 87 requirement is subject to the general waiver of the operator license requirement for subscribers of a Wireless Radio Service. See 47 CFR  1.903c see also id.  1.907 providing that part 1 Wireless Radio Services include, inter alia, part 87 services. Given that NNA assignments are intended to provide operators with direct access to spectrum, however, it appears unlikely that many UAS operators that rely on NNA assignments will be doing so as subscribers of a Wireless Radio Service. 158 See FCC, Examinations, httpswww.fcc.govwirelessbureau-divisionsmobility-divisioncommercial-radio- operator-license-programexaminations last visited Sept. 6, 2022. 159 47 U.S.C.  318. 160 See, e.g., AIA Petition at 9.

Conversely, would it be in the public interest to forgo any such operator licensing or permitting requirements as unnecessary or inappropriate in light of FAA regulation of and authority over UAS remote pilot qualifications, or for other reasons? 73. We also seek comment on whether the new service should be subject to rules under part 1, subpart F governing Wireless Radio Service applications and proceedings.163 The Wireless Radio Services are already defined to include licensed-by-rule services such as those under parts 95 and 96, as well as public and private part 87 aviation services, although not all of these subpart F provisions apply to licensed-by-rule services, such as those requirements governing license applications.164 Accordingly, we seek comment on whether NNA services, even if licensed by rule, should be included in and subject to the subpart F rules for Wireless Radio Services to the same extent as other licensed-by-rule services. 74. Streamlined procedures to update incorporated standards. We anticipate that any technical standard developed by a standards organization that we incorporate by reference into our rules will be subject to ongoing revisions as parties gain more experience and the UAS industry continues to rapidly evolve. For example, RTCA DO-362A, which we consider above, is a 2020 revision of the RTCA DO-362 standard issued by RTCA in 2016, and RTCA Special Committee 228 SC-228 is already working on a second revision.165 Accordingly, we anticipate that the rules will need to be revisited in the future to reflect important and beneficial standard updates. In the past, the Commission has found it in the public interest to streamline the process for incorporating updates to a previously adopted standard, by delegating rulemaking authority to one or more Bureaus for this purpose.166 To help ensure that the rules for 5030-5091 MHz UAS operations continue to reflect the most current version of any incorporated standard for 5030-5091 MHz UAS operations, we invite comment on whether we should adopt a comparable delegation of rulemaking authority in this case. Specifically, we seek comment on whether to delegate joint rulemaking authority to WTB and OET to incorporate into the Commissions rules, after consultation with the FAA and NTIA, and notice and an opportunity for public comment, any updated version of a previously incorporated technical standard applicable to UAS 161 See CTIA AIA Petition Comments at 19-20 Small UAV Coalition AIA Petition Comments at 7. 162 See Small UAV Coalition AIA Petition Comments at 6. 163 See 47 CFR pt. 1, subpt. F Wireless Radio Services Applications and Proceedings. The term Wireless Radio Services or WRS is defined as all radio services authorized in parts 13, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 74, 80, 87, 90, 95, 96, 97 and 101 of this chapter, whether commercial or private in nature. 47 CFR  1.907. Thus, WRS is an umbrella designation covering a wide range of terrestrially-based licensed wireless services. 164 See 47 CFR  1.907 definition of Wireless Radio Services. 165 See, e.g., SC-228 June 2022 Terms of Reference at 5 indicating that DO-362B has a due date of October 2023. 166 See, e.g., Section 68.4a of the Commissions Rules Governing Hearing Aid-Compatible Telephones, WT Docket 01-309, Report and Order, 18 FCC Rcd 16753, 16779, para. 63 2003 Amendment of the Commissions Rules Governing Hearing Aid-Compatible Mobile Handsets, WT Docket No. 07-250, First Report and Order, 23 FCC Rcd 3406, 3441, para. 87 2008 Access to Telecommunication Equipment and Services by Persons with Disabilities Amendment of the Commissions Rules Governing Hearing Aid-Compatible Handsets, CG Docket No. 13-46, WT Docket Nos. 07-250, 10-254, Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration, 32 FCC Rcd 9063, 9092, Appx.

Network Supported Service NSS Service Rules 75. We seek comment on the license terms and service rules we should adopt for NSS licenses. We seek comment in particular on issuing exclusive use, geographic area defined licenses for a specific term of years, with rights of renewal, subject to specific performance network coverage obligations. We seek comment on appropriate technical and operational requirements and on the assignment process rules. 76. Geographic area licenses. Consistent with our approach in several other bands that has promoted the deployment of wide area networks for a variety of fixed and mobile services,169 we propose to license NSS spectrum blocks in the 5030-5091 MHz band for exclusive use on a geographic area basis. Geographic area licensing provides certainty to licensees and promotes efficient spectrum use, among other things, and will give licensees siting flexibility that will promote the deployment of wide area networks in the 5030-5091 MHz band. Geographic area licensing will also help to facilitate rapid assignment of licenses, utilizing competitive bidding when mutually exclusive applications are received.170 We seek comment on this approach, on its costs and benefits, and on alternative licensing approaches. If a party opposes using geographic licensing, it should explain its position, describe the licensing scheme it supports, and identify the costs and benefits associated with its alternative licensing proposal. 77. We further seek comment on the appropriate geographic license area or areas for NSS licenses to support NSS UAS operations and facilitate investment, including investment by small entities, and robust spectrum use. We seek comment on whether we should adopt larger license areas such as Regional Economic Area Groupings REAG or nationwide markets to facilitate NSS uses that may often involve flight over long distances, adopt a more granular scheme such as Partial Economic Areas PEA, which would provide more flexibility to serve a smaller area but still permit parties to achieve a larger area through aggregation, or adopt a mix of large and small license areas for different spectrum blocks.171 While NTIA supports licensing by REAG, AIA argues in its Refresh PN comments that license areas corresponding to the Air Route Traffic Control Center ARTCC areas or other areas that make sense in an aviation system context would be appropriate, and Wisk similarly recommends use of the ARTCC areas to provide alignment with a general air traffic density basis.172 We seek comment on whether to 167 While we invite comment on this issue, we note that it involves potential rules regarding agency organization, procedure, or practice, which are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements under section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act. See 5 U.S.C.  553bA. 168 Cf. 47 CFR  0.241a1ii, 20.19k2. 169 See, e.g., 47 CFR  27.6h, i, and m AWS-1, AWS-4, and 3.7 GHz Service bands, respectively. 170 See, e.g., Facilitating Shared Use in the 3100-3550 MHz Band, WT Docket No. 19-348, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 35 FCC Rcd 11078, 11098, para. 56 2020. 171 REAGs divide the nation, including its territories, into 12 areas, while PEAs divide it into 416 areas.

But see AIA Feb. 1, 2022 Ex Parte, Attach. at 7 suggesting that geographic area licenses could also be issued for some blocks on a state-wide or nationwide basis. Each Air Route Traffic Control Center ARTCC provides, within a defined region of the country, air traffic services to aircraft continued. 508 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 adopt license areas based on a geographic area division of the country that has been developed specifically for aviation purposes, such as the ARTCC areas. 78. License term. We propose to issue NSS licenses for an initial 15-year term. AIA and Wisk both support a license term longer than 10 years,173 and we believe that circumstances in the band, including the need to set up a DFMS in the band and integrate its functions with operations in NSS spectrum, as well as the nascent stage of standards development and other technical work regarding NSS networks generally, favor the use of a longer initial license term. We propose to limit subsequent terms to 10 years. We seek comment on these proposals. 79. Performance network build-out or coverage requirements. The Commission also generally establishes build-out or coverage requirements for licenses, referred to as performance requirements, to ensure that spectrum is intensely and efficiently used and as mandated by the Act for auctioned spectrum.174 We seek comment on performance requirements that are appropriate for NSS licensees and UAS operation. We seek comment in particular on whether to adopt a population-based performance metric, such as a requirement to cover at least 80 percent of the population in the license area within 12 years of the grant of the license, as the Commission recently adopted for geographic licenses in other bands.175 We also seek comment on whether to adopt an appropriate interim performance requirement, such as a requirement to cover at least 45 percent of the population in the license area within six years of license grant.176 80. While some parties support population-based coverage requirements for NSS licensees,177 AIA argues that population is not an appropriate benchmark in this context, because the spectrum will be used by aircraft rather than people on the ground, including for crop examination, border surveillance, and travel over sparsely populated areas.178 AIA argues that such uses require reliable control links for all geographic areas of flight regardless of proximity to population centers, and suggests that a build-out requirement based on user demand, special diversity and signal strength would better meet the needs of beyond-radio-line-of-sight UAS operations.179 We seek comment on AIAs arguments, and on whether operating on an Instrument Flight Rule IFR Flight Plan in controlled airspace, principally during the en route phase of the flight.

We note that some parties within the aviation community use the term performance requirements to refer to a particular minimum technical or operational standard of performance. See, e.g., AIA Refresh PN Comments at 14. We do not seek comment on such requirements here rather, we use performance requirements as the Commission has customarily used it, to refer to deadlines on licensees for meeting certain deployment or coverage milestones. 176 See 3.7 GHz RO, 35 FCC Rcd at 2385, para. 93 900 MHz Service Rules RO, 35 FCC Rcd at 5235, para. 129. 177 See L3H Refresh PN Comments at 16 see also id. at 18 asserting that similar to cellular phone service, commercial UAS rollout of terrestrial services is likely to follow population density. 178 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 15. 179 See id. 509 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 we should either require licensees to meet some criteria other than population, such as geographic area coverage of 25 of the license area at year six and 50 of the license area at year 12.180 Alternatively, should we provide licensees with the option of meeting either a population-based requirement or some alternative? To the extent commenters recommend alternative build-out requirements, we ask them to propose either specific numerical benchmarks or other specific and objectively verifiable buildout criteria. 81. We seek comment on appropriate rules for compliance demonstration and enforcement. As for compliance demonstration, we propose to adopt a process similar to compliance rules applicable to part 27 licensees, requiring a demonstration of compliance with the performance requirements by filing a construction notification with the Commission within 15 days of the expiration of the applicable benchmark, including electronic coverage maps accurately depicting the boundaries of the licensed area and the boundaries of the actual areas to which the licensee provides service.181 If a coverage map is used to demonstrate compliance, we seek comment on the appropriate standardized parameters for the propagation model. For example, should there be standardized values for inputs such as cell edge probability, cell loading, and clutter? As for enforcement, we propose that if a licensee fails to meet the final performance requirement, the license authorization will terminate automatically without specific Commission action.182 If we adopt an interim requirement, we propose that failure to meet the requirement would result in the reduction by two years of both the due date for the final performance requirement and the license term resulting in a final performance requirement at year 10 and a license term of 13 years.183 82. License Renewal. We seek comment on the appropriate standard for license renewal. In the WRS Second RO, the Commission adopted a unified regulatory framework for the Wireless Radio Services WRS that replaced the existing patchwork of service-specific rules regarding renewal with a single unified standard, and safe harbors for meeting that standard for different service categories, including a safe harbor for geographic licensees providing commercial service.184 We seek comment on whether the regulatory renewal framework for WRS commercial geographic licensees is appropriate for NSS licensees. If we apply this framework, are there any special factors we need to account for or incorporate in the context of networks for support of UAS operations? 83. Competitive bidding or other assignment procedures. In the event that mutually exclusive license applications are received, we propose to assign these exclusive-use licenses through a system of competitive bidding.185 Consistent with the competitive bidding procedures the Commission has used in previous auctions, we propose to conduct any auction for geographic area licenses for spectrum in the band in conformity with the part 1, subpart Q general competitive bidding rules, subject 180 See, e.g., 900 MHz Service Rules RO, 35 FCC Rcd at 5235, para. 130. 181 See 47 CFR  1.946d, 27.14k. 182 See 47 CFR  1.946c. 183 See, e.g., 47 CFR  27.14g1, h1, r3. 184 See Amendment of Parts 1, 22, 24, 27, 74, 80, 90, 95, and 101 to Establish Uniform License Renewal, Discontinuance of Operation, and Geographic Partitioning and Spectrum Disaggregation Rules and Policies for Certain Wireless Radio Services, Second Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 32 FCC Rcd 8874, 8883-85, paras. 20-23 2017 WRS Second RO see also 47 CFR  1.949. The renewal standard requires that an applicant for renewal . . . demonstrate that over the course of the license term, the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public, or operated and continues to operate the licensee to meet its private, internal communications needs. See 47 CFR  1.949d. The safe harbor for geographic licensees providing commercial service requires an applicant for renewal to demonstrate, in part, that it met its performance requirements and continues to provide service at least at the level required by its performance requirements. See 47 CFR  1.949e2, 3. 185 See 47 U.S.C.  309j1. 510 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 to any modification of the part 1 rules that the Commission may adopt in the future.186 We seek comment on whether any of these rules would be inappropriate or should be modified for an auction of licenses in this band.187 Our proposal to assign these licenses through competitive bidding assumes that Congress amends section 309j1 of the Communications Act to extend the Commissions authority to award licenses by competitive bidding.188 We seek comment on alternate assignment procedures in the event that the Commissions statutory authority to auction licenses is not extended. 84. If we provide for the assignment of these licenses through a system of competitive bidding, we also propose to make bidding credits for designated entities available for this band and seek comment on this proposal. If we decide to offer small business bidding credits, we seek comment on how to define a small business. In recent years, for other flexible-use licenses, we have adopted bidding credits for the two larger designated entity business sizes provided in the Commissions part 1 standardized schedule of bidding credits.189 We propose to use the same definitions here.190 Accordingly, we propose to define a small business as an entity with average gross revenues for the preceding five years not exceeding 55 million, and a very small business as an entity with average gross revenues for the preceding five years not exceeding 20 million.191 A qualifying small business would be eligible for a bidding credit of 15 percent and a qualifying very small business would be eligible for a bidding credit of 25 percent.192 We also seek comment on whether the aviation-safety purpose of the band, the characteristics of these frequencies, or any other factor suggest that we should not make available one or either of these designated entity bidding credits, or that we should adopt different small business size standards and associated bidding credits than we have in the past. Finally, we seek comment on whether we should offer rural service providers a designated entity bidding credit for licenses in this band. Commenters addressing these proposals or advocating for any alternatives should consider what specific details of the licenses or operations in the band may affect whether designated entities will apply for them and whether designated entities should be supported by bidding credits. 186 See 47 CFR  1.2101-1.2114. 187 Consistent with the statutory requirement and our longstanding approach, we propose to use a public notice process to solicit public input on certain details of auction design and the auction procedures. See 47 U.S.C.  309j3Ei 3.5 GHz RO, 30 FCC Rcd at 4009, para. 153 Auction of Priority Access Licenses for the 3550- 3650 MHz Band Comment Sought on Competitive Bidding Procedures for Auction 105 Bidding in Auction 105 Scheduled to Begin June 25, 2020, AU Docket No. 19-244, Public Notice, 34 FCC Rcd 9215 2019. 188 See 47 U.S.C.  309j1. 189 See, e.g., 3.7 GHz RO, 35 FCC Rcd at 2374-76, paras. 65-68. While the Commission is not required to adopt bidding credits for a particular service, the part 1 rules provide that the Commission may do so by adopting small business or rural service provider bidding credits in the service-specific rules for a band. See 47 CFR  1.2110f1. Any caps with respect to available bidding credits are adopted on an auction-by-auction basis. Id.  1.2110f2ii cap on designated entity bidding discount, 1.2110f4ii cap on rural service provider discount. 190 The standardized schedule of bidding credits provided in section 1.2110f2i of the rules defines small businesses based on average gross revenues for the preceding three years. In December 2018, Congress revised the standard set out in the Small Business Act for categorizing a business concern as a small business concern, by changing the annual average gross receipts benchmark from a three-year period to a five-year period. Thus, as a general matter, a federal agency cannot propose to categorize a business concern as a small business concern for Small Business Act purposes unless the size of the concern is based on its annual average gross receipts over a period of not less than 5 years. 15 U.S.C.  632a2CiiII, as amended by Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-324 Dec. 17, 2018 see 13 CFR  121.903a1ii. For consistency with the statutory requirements, we therefore propose to adopt the Small Business Acts revised five-year average gross receipts benchmark for purposes of determining which entities qualify for small business bidding credits. 191 See 47 CFR  1.2110f2iB, C. 192 See id. 511 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 85. AIA proposes that the Commission directly select NSS licensees from the submitted license applications based on criteria to be established by the FAA or by a multi-stakeholder group to ensure that applicants meet aviation performance levels and minimum performance standards established in RTCA DO-377A.193 We seek comment on AIAs proposal or alternative approaches for selecting the NSS licensees and whether such approaches would be consistent with our statutory obligation under section 309j of the Act to use competitive bidding to resolve mutually exclusive applications, and with our general responsibility for licensing of spectrum uses under Title III of the Communications Act.194 86. Regardless of the assignment mechanism, we seek comment on whether NSS licensees should be subject to a particular limit on the amount of NSS spectrum they can aggregate in the 5030- 5091 MHz band, such as a limit of 20 megahertz. To the extent that NSS spectrum is assigned on geographic market basis, are limits on 5030-5091 MHz spectrum aggregation necessary to ensure competition for network-based CNPC services? 87. Technical requirements. We seek comment on appropriate technical requirements and parameters for NSS licenses. As an initial matter, the appropriate technical requirements may depend in part on the types of operations likely to be carried out in the band and the network architectures necessary to support such operations. Accordingly, we seek comment on what operations commenters anticipate the NSS licensees will be used to support. Will they include Advanced Air Mobility, package delivery services, or infrastructure inspection? Are they likely to be predominantly operations above, or below, a certain altitude, or to involve predominantly large or predominantly small UA? Will they involve autonomous operations, and if so, to what extent and for what purposes will such autonomous operations likely require network-based CNPC? For those anticipated operations, we seek comment on what type of network architectures will likely be needed in the band to support such uses. Will they necessarily be like the terrestrial cellular networks, or will there be other architectures, and if so, of what nature? To the extent that parties have already developed or plan to deploy network infrastructure to support UAS NSS operations, we seek comment on what type of network architectures they have developed or plan to deploy for this purpose. 88. We seek to adopt technical rules that will promote efficient use of spectrum and provide licensees as much flexibility as possible in terms of the services they wish to provide, while also providing adequate protection of licensees in the band or adjacent bands. We seek comment on requirements that will achieve these goals in the context of spectrum intended to support network-based UAS CNPC with the level of reliability needed for safety-critical aviation purposes. In particular, we seek comment on whether the RTCA DO-362A standard or equivalent technical parameters, which we propose above for NNA operations, should also apply to NSS licenses. Would adopting similar requirements for NSS help to ensure compatibility between NNA and NSS operations? We ask that commenters discuss the adequacy of the RTCA DO-362A specified equipment and operational performance requirements for NSS operations, including both transmitter power and receiver input power, and required minimum coupling loss separation distance between ground and airborne CNPC radios and emissions from other licensed radio services. We also seek comment on whether to require NSS licensees to comply with RTCA DO-377A, which addresses the minimum performance, safety, and security standards for a CNPC link system overall, whether that system relies on a network or a direct link.195 As noted above, AIA recommends that we require UAS equipment to comply with RTCA DO-362A, but leave the requirements in RTCA DO-377A to be considered by the FAA or an appropriate group of 193 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 6 AIA Feb. 1, 2022 Ex Parte, Attach. at 6. 194 See 47 U.S.C.  309j1. 195 See supra para. 69 see also, e.g., Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 2 n.5 DO-377A provides a basis for the safety, performance, and security standards that a CNPC network should meet . . . .. 512 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 stakeholders.196 We seek comment on whether to take this approach for NSS licensees. To the extent that NSS licensees are permitted to support communications other than CNPC, we seek comment on whether those services should be subject to the same technical requirements as apply to CNPC. 89. Because the RTCA DO-362A standard is focused on point-to-point or point-to-multipoint i.e., non-networked link performance rather than network services, and RTCA DO-377A on establishing the minimum performance, security, and safety standards of a system rather than mitigating interference impacts on other systems, we seek comment on whether application of either of these standards sufficiently address the impact of wide area network operations, including cellular networks, on other services in-band or in adjacent bands. We further seek comment on whether applying these standards, or specific parameters drawn from these standards, to network-based services in the band may unnecessarily restrict the range of services or operations in the band. We seek comment on whether there are any additional or alternative technical requirements that we should consider for NSS licenses and on the extent to which communications under these technical requirements would have sufficient reliability for safety-critical aviation purposes. To the extent that parties argue for alternative technical requirements, we ask that they be specific as to what requirements they propose be adopted in the rules. 90. We note that work is ongoing to develop technical standards for reliable UAS communications over mobile networks. For example, RTCA SC-228 is currently working on a joint standard with EUROCAE Working Group 105 for use of Cellular commercial networks for command- and-control Links used for type certificated UAS.197 CTIA states that the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP is addressing how commercial wireless Long Term Evolution LTE technologies can satisfy key performance indicators . . . for UAS, and support various UAS use cases.198 We seek comment on these efforts, on the scope, status, and anticipated completion date of any other current or planned studies or standards development work regarding the reliability of UAS communications over LTE or other mobile network technologies, and on whether these studies or standards will address or apply to UAS network-based communications in the 5030-5091 MHz band. If not, we seek comment on whether the development of these studies or standards may nevertheless be helpful in determining the appropriate requirements for networks in the 5030-5091 MHz band. We further seek comment on the extent to which any of these studies or standards are being or will be coordinated with the aviation community or the FAA to ensure that they provide sufficient reliability for all UAS use cases, including aviation flights where communications is safety-critical. We also seek comment on the extent to which mobile networks using LTE or other mobile network technologies can be implemented in the 5030-5091 MHz band consistent with the RTCA DO-362A standard. 196 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 8, 13-14 see also RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 7 recommending that the Commission impose no altitude limits on usage in the 5030-5091 MHz band, but indicating that the FAA may wish to impose limitations based on the types of UA flight operations citing DO-362A, Appx. H and DO-377A, Appx. A WInnForum Refresh PN Comments at 3 advocating that the Commission establish rules with the minimum necessary technical restrictions to provide adequate protection against harmful interference. Above, we address in greater detail the potential reliance on a multi-stakeholder group to further develop recommendations or standards for UAS or DFMS operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band. 197 SC-228 June 2022 Terms of Reference at 5 indicating a targeted completion date of January 2023 see also id. at 2 indicating that Phase Three of standards development will consider new licensed bands that are made available for use for command-and-control Links, including but not limited to Cellular Networks, 8 indicating that the new document will enable a common standard for avionics using standardized cellular services offered worldwide. 198 CTIA Refresh PN Comments at 11 see also id. at 13 Allowing the commercial mobile industry to continue working with standards-setting bodies such as 3GPP to develop standards to support UAS will be an effective and efficient approach to the expeditious development of UAS wireless standards that can be deployed, nationwide and worldwide.. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP is an umbrella organization consisting of standards organizations that develop protocols for cellular telecommunications, including the Long-Term Evolution standard LTE. See 3GPP, About 3GPP, httpswww.3gpp.orgabout-3gpp last visited Sept. 6, 2022. 513 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 91. As an alternative to requiring NSS compliance with the RTCA DO-362A standard generally, are there certain specific requirements of RTCA DO-362A that we should minimally impose, to ensure compatibility with NNA operations or for other purposes? For example, as we noted earlier, RTCA asserts that all equipment in the band must comply with the 50 ms Time Division Duplex TDD requirements specified under section 2.2.1.3 of the RTCA DO-362A standard to ensure that UAS operations in the band are compatible with each other.199 We seek comment on whether, even if we do not require general compliance with RTCA DO-362A, we should mandate compliance with the TDD requirements under section 2.2.1.3. Further, we seek comment on whether we should, at a minimum, require NSS equipment to comply with the power limits and out-of-band emission limits established in the standard to ensure that such equipment is compatible with AeroMACS.200 92. We seek comment on any other technical issues that need to be addressed to enable the deployment of NSS networks. For example, in order to prevent harmful interference between geographic area licensees, such licensees are typically subject to market boundary power strength limitations.201 Because the networks deployed by geographic area licensees are terrestrial in nature, these limitations were developed using certain technical assumptionsi.e., that natural and manmade terrestrial obstacles attenuate signals, reducing the potential of harmful interference between users in adjacent license service areas.202 Obstacles such as hills, trees, buildings, and other natural and manmade structures attenuate emissions, lessening the interference impact between licensees. UAS operations typically fly above many of these obstacles and, depending on the UA altitude and its distance to the service area boundary border, a UA may be in direct line-of-sight with adjacent license areas and users, greatly increasing the potential for harmful interference. As we anticipate adopting geographic area-based licenses for NSS spectrum, we request comment on an appropriate field strength limit to protect NSS licensees given this increased potential for harmful interference. We seek comment on other necessary technical specifications, such as out-of-band emission limits, and ask that any proposals include technical justifications and analysis, such as UA altitude assumptions, power levels, antenna assumptions, the increasing interference effects resulting from the increasing number of transmitting UA aggregate effects, and the victim receiver characteristics such as receiver sensitivity, and adjacent and non-adjacent channel rejection. 93. Application of requirements from aviation service and wireless radio service rules. As with NNA service rules above, we seek comment on whether and to what extent the NSS service rules should incorporate or be subject to the rules generally applicable to aviation services under subparts B through F of part 87 of the Commissions rules, either in their current form or with modifications.203 We also seek comment on whether the NSS service should be subject to rules under part 1, subpart F governing Wireless Radio Service applications and proceedings.204 In particular, we seek comment on 199 See RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 6 see also AIA Refresh PN Comments at 11 supporting a requirement that transmitters comply with the 50 ms TDD requirements of RTCA DO-362A  2.2.1.3. 200 See, e.g., L3H Refresh PN Comments at 10 The Output Power restrictions identified RTCA DO-362A  2.2.1.6.1.1  2.2.1.6.1.2 in addition to the C Band Airborne Radio Transmitter PSD Limits specified in RTCA DO- 362A  2.2.1.6.2 should protect AeroMACS from potentially harmful interference from UAS. see also RTCA DO-377A at  3.3.1.2 Based on the analysis in DO-362A . . . , the use of C-Band CNPC LOS radios of the C2 Link for surface operations will be compatible with AeroMACS in airports where AeroMACS is available.. 201 See 47 CFR  27.55. 202 For example, geographic area licensees service area power limits in sections 22.913b and 27.55d and e of the Commissions rules are measured at a height 1.6 meters above ground level to estimate the height of a mobile UE taking into account terrain obstacles. See 47 CFR  22.913b, 27.55d, e. 203 See 47 CFR pt. 87, subpts. B Applications and Licenses, C Operating Requirements and Procedures, D Technical Requirements, E Frequencies, F Aircraft Stations. 204 See 47 CFR pt. 1, subpt. F Wireless Radio Services Applications and Proceedings. The term Wireless Radio Services is currently defined as all radio services authorized in parts 13, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 74, 80, 87, 90, 95, 96, 97 and 101 of this chapter, whether commercial or private in nature. 47 CFR  1.907. 514 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 whether to allow partitioning and disaggregation of NSS licenses in secondary market transactions as well as spectrum leasing, including whether we should consider any competitive impacts associated with such transactions.205 Allowing these secondary market transactions would be consistent with the licensing paradigm governing most geographic area licenses and are potentially an effective way to improve spectral efficiency and facilitate targeted network deployments, particularly if the Commission adopts a long license term or large license area. We seek comment on whether these factors support application of the full range of secondary market options to 5030-5091 MHz NSS licensees, or if secondary market rules should either be more restrictive or completely inapplicable due to special considerations of the 5030- 5091 MHz band. 94. We anticipate that NSS licenses will be used to provide mobile network services to UAS operators on a commercial basis. Accordingly, we also seek comment on whether and to what extent we should incorporate regulations that regulate commercial mobile networks in other bands, such as the requirements generally applicable to part 27 flexible-use licensees. For example, should we incorporate or apply the requirements of sections 27.52 RF safety, 27.56 antenna structure height for the protection of air safety, or 27.64 protection from interference?206 95. Other requirements. We seek comment on any other service rules we should adopt for NSS licensees. For example, to ensure that UA flights are supported in the event they need to cross license area boundaries, should we adopt a roaming requirement? If anything more than market forces is necessary to address this issue, should the current roaming requirements under section 20.12e of the Commissions rules, requiring commercial mobile data service providers to offer roaming arrangements to other such providers on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, be extended to NSS licensees for this purpose?207 If these requirements are sufficient, how and where should we integrate them in the context of NSS service rules? If they are insufficient, what additional rules are needed to ensure that UAS operate continually and safely across licensing areas? We also seek comment on whether to adopt an interoperability requirement, for example, requiring NSS equipment to be capable of operating over any part of the 5030-5091 MHz band dedicated to NSS operations, or requiring support for the entire band. We further seek comment on whether to impose requirements to enable seamless switching between NNA and NSS services to support flights that may need to rely on both modes of spectrum access. Should we require NSS licensees to provide any other information, including the manufacturer, model, or other details regarding the UAs that will be flown? We seek comment on any requirements or other measures that would promote intensive use of the band. For example, we seek comment on how we might facilitate use of NSS for both low and high altitude uses, and whether we should require NSS licensees to support both low and high altitude uses or should take other steps to ensure that both low and high uses are supported. 96. Satellite-based networks. As discussed above, the 5030-5091 MHz band is allocated internationally and domestically for AMSRS, which would support the provision of CNPC services over satellite. AIAs petition for rulemaking, however, did not request or propose that any provision be made for satellite services in the band, and no party in the current record has proposed such an option.208 It also appears that RTCAs work on CNPC MOPS in the 5030-5091 MHz band has, up to now, largely focused 205 See 47 CFR pt. 1, subpt. X spectrum leasing,  1.950 partitioning and disaggregation. 206 See 47 CFR  27.52, 27.56, 27.64. 207 See 47 CFR  20.12e. 208 See, e.g., AIA Refresh PN Comments at 13 stating the licensees in spectrum for network service will be terrestrial station owners see also id. at 5 distinguishing between beyond-line-of-sight operations in the past, which were based on satellite-support, and the future of terrestrial CNPC links that would involve multiple, remote Ground Radio Stations on a network providing long-range, continuous C2 link coverage and remote operation, without reliance on or the disadvantages of satellite communications links. RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 8 asserting that the Ku and Ka fixed satellite services bands are already being considered for CNPC links and have significant capacity. 515 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 on terrestrial rather than satellite services in the band.209 We nevertheless seek comment on whether to authorize NSS licensees, at their discretion, to provide network-supported service for UAS CNPC through either a satellite or terrestrial network, or alternatively, whether the Commission should provide that certain NSS licenses are dedicated exclusively to satellite-based service.210 We seek comment on whether and to what extent there is interest in the United States in providing a satellite service for CNPC in the 5030-5091 MHz band, on the costs and benefits of permitting NSS licensees to deploy satellite services for network-supported CNPC, and on the advantages and disadvantages of a satellite option over terrestrial networks in this context. For example, would satellite be a feasible and desirable means of deploying a CNPC-focused network with the ubiquitous coverage needed to support long-range operations, particularly those operations that may occur in remote areas and over oceanic regions or other large bodies of water? 97. Assuming we permit NSS licensees to deploy satellite-based service, we seek comment on how to permit and integrate the provision of such services and on the appropriate service rules. We seek comment on the application of the Commissions part 25 rules, which govern satellite communications, to such services, and the extent to which the rules applicable to terrestrial NSS networks should also apply to satellite-based NSS networks. We further seek comment on how the DFMS and other proposals discussed above would work for satellite communications. For example, how would a DFMS implement opportunistic access to spectrum in which satellite operations might be deployed? We also seek comment on how to ensure that any such satellite services are compatible with both terrestrial NSS and NNA operations in the band and other in-band and adjacent-band services, and on the circumstances, requirements, coordination processes, andor restrictions necessary to ensure compatibility and to provide the reliability intended for CNPC in this band. For example, should we permit an NSS licensee to deploy a satellite service only if the NSS license is nationwide or the licensee in question has aggregated all geographic area licenses in a particular block throughout the nation? Are guard bands necessary between blocks with satellite deployments and blocks used for terrestrial networks or operations? Footnote 5.443D of the Table of Frequency Allocations provides that services under the satellite allocation in the 5030-5091 MHz band are subject to coordination under ITU Radio Regulations R.R. No. 9.11A, and that the use of this frequency band by the AMSRS is limited to internationally standardized aeronautical systems.211 We seek comment on what rules, if any, we should adopt to implement the requirements under footnote 5.443D. 98. High-Altitude Platform Stations. We seek comment on whether to permit NSS licensees to deploy High-altitude Platform Stations HAPS. The Commissions rules define a High Altitude Platform Station as a station located on an object at an altitude of 20 to 50 km and at a specified, nominal, fixed point relative to the Earth.212 Potentially, these stations could be used by NSS licensees as a long-range relay of CNPC between two or more stations, and RTCA DO-362A includes extensive 209 While the RTCA DO-362A MOPS focuses on a terrestrial based i.e., not satellite-based CNPC Link System in the 5030-5091 MHz band, see RTCA DO-362A,  1.1, it also includes discussion of a satellite system design compatible with the terrestrial system in an Appendix. See RTCA DO-362A, Appx. G C Band Satellite Link Compatibility. In addition, the Terms of Reference for SC-228 Rev 15 dated June 23, 2022, indicates that a planned update of RTCA DO-362A, to be designated DO-362B, will incorporate changes required to harmonize SATCOM compatibility with EUROCAE Standard. See SC-228 June 2022 Terms of Reference at 5. 210 See also supra section B.1 Band Plan seeking comment on preserving a portion of the band for satellite CNPC. 211 See 47 CFR  2.106, footnote 5.443D. ITU R.R. No. 9.11A provides that for a station for which the requirements to coordinate is included in a footnote to the Table of Frequency Allocations referring to this provision, the provisions of Nos. 9.12 to 9.16 are applicable. ITU R.R. No. 9.11A. ITU R.R. No. 9.6 in turn provides that before an administration notifies to the Bureau or brings into use a frequency assignment in any of the cases listed below including the cases covered by 9.11A, it shall effect coordination, as required, with other administrations identified under No. 9.27. ITU R.R. No. 9.6. 212 47 CFR  2.1c see also ITU R.R. No. 1.66A. 516 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 analysis of such an option, which it refers to as a High-altitude Relay System.213 We seek comment on whether and to what extent there is current interest in deploying HAPS as all or part of a network solution for CNPC, on the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the use of HAPS to provide all or part of a network service in the 5030-5091 MHz band, and on the costs and benefits of permitting HAPS for this purpose.214 To the extent it is feasible and economic, are there limitations on the circumstances or uses to which it can be applied? For example, would it be available only to provide relay between two or more UA, or could it also provide relay between UA and stations on the ground? We also seek comment on what technical or other requirements or restrictions are needed either to ensure that NSS use of HAPS to provide network service would be compatible with other operations and services or for other reasons. For example, we seek comment on whether, consistent with the definition of HAPS in the Commissions rules, we should specify an altitude floor andor ceiling on the use of such stations.215 Given the potential footprint of a HAPS-based service, should we permit an NSS licensee to deploy HAPS only if the NSS licensee holds a nationwide market or holds all geographic area licenses on a particular block nationwide? We further seek comment on whether permitting such systems warrants any revisions to the proposals or options for the NSS rules. In addition, because the HAPS acting as network relays for UA communications would also themselves be UA, we seek comment on whether an NSS licensees operation of such stations may require CNPC during ascent, descent, or otherwise, whether and to what extent such stations should be permitted to use NNA assignments for CNPC, and if so, what changes to our NNA proposals or other rules are needed.216 We note that No. 4.23 of the ITU Radio Regulations provides that transmissions to or from high altitude platform stations shall be limited to bands specifically identified in Article 5 WRC-12.217 At present, Article 5 does not specifically identify the 5030-5091 MHz band for this purpose.218 We seek comment on whether, if we restricted such stations to deployments below the 20 km floor for HAPS as defined in the ITU Radio Regulations, permitting HAPS in the band could nonetheless be consistent with No. 4.23 or if, to permit such use, we would need to seek 213 See, e.g., RTCA DO-362A, Appx. U C Band High Altitude Relay System. In its comment, RTCA refers to this option as a High-Altitude PlatformRelay System. RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 5. 214 The record does not reflect any current interest in using HAPS for the provision of network-based CNPC in the band. In comments submitted in 2018 in response to the AIA Petition, the Elefante Group did indicate that it planned to deploy what it described as persistent, unmanned stratospheric airborne platforms STRAPS . . . to provide stratospheric-based communications service, and that it was interested in using direct links in the 5030- 5091 MHz band for command-and-control during ascent and descent of the stations. Elefante Group AIA Petition Comments at 1-2. Once in place, however, the stations were intended to provide 5G solutions in urban and rural markets rather than CNPC services in the 5030-5091 MHz band. Id. In a subsequent filing in another proceeding, the Elefante Group further indicated, in regard to its plans to deploy STRAPS, that due to unforeseen developments, it was unable to state with certainty its ability at this time to deploy these platforms. See Elefante Group Comments, WT Docket No. 20-133, at 2 filed Aug. 5, 2020. 215 47 CFR  2.1c. 216 RTCA asserts that the necessary duration of an assignment to support such HAPS relays may be significantly longer than assignments for other types of UA flights. See RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 5 asserting that because the HAPS relay scenario will involve a UA that loiters for months at altitude  60Kft., the end of flight would be much longer after the beginning of the flight than for non-HAPS flights and that continuous usage of the spectrum would be needed throughout the flight to support internal control messages being sent tofrom the HAPS UA. 217 ITU R.R. No. 4.23. 218 Article V of the ITU Radio Regulations reflects the frequency allocation decisions made by the World Radio Councils WRC to date. See ITU R.R., Article V see also 47 CFR  2.106. At three WRCs collectively WRC-97, WRC-200, and WRC-12, spectrum for HAPS was designated in the 4748 GHz, 2 GHz, 2731 GHz and 6 GHz bands, and after study for WRC-19, additional spectrum was identified 31-31.3 GHz and 38-39.5 GHz globally, and in Region 2 including US, 21.4-22 GHz and 24.25-27.5 GHz. See Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Seeks to Supplement the Record on 708090 GHz Bands Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, WT Docket No. 20-133, Public Notice, DA 21-1263, n.15 WTB Oct. 8, 2021. 517 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 a revision to the bands in which HAPS is permitted under ITU R.R., Article V. We seek comment on whether there is any other legal constraint or consideration to address in permitting such use. 8. Equipment Authorization 99. To ensure that equipment in the new band has the level of reliability and safety required of aviation equipment, we propose to impose equipment authorization requirements similar to those under sections 87.145 and 87.147 of the Commissions rules to all equipment intended for use in the 5030-5091 MHz band. Section 87.145 requires that each transmitter must be certificated for use in the relevant service, and section 87.147 establishes a specific equipment authorization process for part 87 equipment, which, for the frequencies in the 5030-5091 MHz band among others, requires coordination with the FAA.219 We note that 5030-5091 MHz UAS radio equipment must independently satisfy any applicable FAA requirements,220 and we anticipate that this coordination process will ensure that the 5030-5091 MHz equipment authorizations by the Commission and the FAA are consistent and that all equipment approved for use in the band will meet both agencies requirements. We seek comment on our proposals. 9. Protection of Other Services a. Microwave Landing Systems 100. The Microwave Landing System MLS is a radio guidance system that was intended to be installed at airports to aid aircraft in landing when, e.g., the airports are visually obscured by bad weather, and that provided certain technical improvements over the original Instrument Landing System.221 Footnote 5.444 of the Table of Frequency Allocations provides that in the band 5030-5150 MHz, the requirements of MLS have priority over other uses of this frequency band.222 101. These systems were rendered obsolete by more recent instrument-landing solutions, including GPS-based solutions like the Wide Area Augmentation System, and a search of ULS reveals no active MLS in use by non-federal licensees.223 Further, according to NTIAs most recent summary of federal use of the 5030-5250 MHz band, the FAA does not anticipate utilizing MLS installations at airports.224 NTIA also notes, however, that the Air Force has a number of assignments in the 5030- 5091 MHz band for a transportable version of the MLS, an all-weather precision landing system for tactical purposes and has installed these systems at several Air Force bases.225 It states that the Air Force will continue to use MLS into the foreseeable future in order to provide landing guidance to military aircraft.226 102. We seek comment on what measures we should adopt to protect federal MLS services from harmful interference by UAS communications in the 5030-5091 MHz band. Should we establish exclusion zones around the Air Force bases with MLS deployments, with a process to add or eliminate 219 See 47 CFR  87.145a, 87.147d. 220 See, e.g., TSO-C213a. 221 See Section 374 Report at 5. 222 See 47 CFR  2.106, footnote 5.444 see also 47 CFR  87.173b authorizing MLS over the frequencies 5030- 5150 MHz. The rules also permit deployment of radionavigation land test stations at 5031 MHz but only for the testing of MLS airborne receiving equipment. See 47 CFR  87.475c2. 223 See Section 374 Report at 5 stating the systems are obsolete and no longer in use FCC, Advanced License Search, httpswireless2.fcc.govUlsAppUlsSearchsearchAdvanced.jsp search restricted to frequency range of 5030 and 5091 MHz see also NTIA Spectrum Compendium, 5030-5250 MHz, Feb. 2021, at 11, httpswww.ntia.doc.govfilesntiapublicationscompendium5030.00-5250.00-02092021.pdf NTIA Spectrum Compendium 5030-5025 MHz. 224 NTIA Spectrum Compendium 5030-5025 at 11. 225 Id. at 9. 226 Id. at 11. 518 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 exclusion zones to the extent federal MLS stations are deployed or deactivated? AIA proposes that the Commission codify the locations at which MLS operations are conducted and establish a coordination mechanism to enable UAS CNPC operations near those MLS stations.227 We seek comment on this option, the specifics of any such coordination mechanism, and how this or any option would address the deployment of new federal MLS stations, particularly in the case of NSS licensees that may have already deployed networks in the area of the new deployment. 103. Because we find no current licensed non-federal MLS systems in operation, and given that the FAA does not anticipate the future use of these systems at airports, we seek comment on whether any measures are necessary to protect non-federal MLS. We also seek comment on whether to provide that no future non-federal MLS licenses including MLS radionavigation land test licenses at 5031 MHz will be granted in the 5030-5091 MHz band by amending sections 87.173b and 87.475 of our part 87 rules to remove the 5030-5091 MHz band as a band that can be used for non-federal MLS.228 We seek comment on the costs and benefits of this option. Would eliminating the potential for future non-federal MLS in the 5030-5091 MHz band help to ensure a stable spectral environment that may facilitate the use of the band for UAS CNPC? Would it facilitate the use of the band for other communications, to the extent such communications may be permitted? Given the development and widespread adoption of alternative solutions for instrument-based landing and the apparent abandonment of MLS, is there any need to preserve the option in our rules for licensing of non-federal MLS in this band? b. Out-of-band Services 104. Radioastronomy. Footnote US211 of the Table of Frequency Allocations currently provides that in a number of frequency bands that includes the 5000-5250 MHz band, applicants for airborne or space station assignments are urged to take all practicable steps to protect radio astronomy observations in the adjacent bands from harmful interference.229 To address the potential impact on radio astronomy observations from UAS transmissions in the 5030-5091 MHz band, NTIA requests that Footnote US211 continue to apply to any services authorized in the 5030-5091 MHz band.230 NTIA also recommends that the Commission require coordination of UAS operations within the National Radio Quiet Zone NRQZ.231 NTIA further recommends that additional criteria be developed to minimize UAS impact to particular radio astronomy sites, particularly from low-altitude operations, but does not elaborate or propose particular criteria.232 As a further measure, NTIA recommends that the requirements 227 See AIA Petition at 18 see also AURA AIA Petition Comments at 6 Boeing AIA Petition Comments at 11 Lockheed Martin AIA Petition Comments at 4-5. 228 We note that removing the frequencies for non-federal MLS operations from our service rules would not affect federal authority to utilize the band for MLS, or the need to protect such services. 229 See 47 CFR  2.106, footnote US211. For certain of these bands, the obligation is limited by Footnote US74, which provides that in the specified bands, the radio astronomy service shall be protected from unwanted emissions only to the extent that such radiation exceeds the level which would be present if the offending station were operating in compliance with the technical standards or criteria applicable to the service in which it operates. See 47 CFR  2.106, footnote US74. The 5030-5091 MHz band, however, is not one of the bands to which Footnote US74 applies. Id. 230 See NTIA Refresh PN Reply at 1. 231 See NTIA Refresh PN Comments at 2. The National Radio Quiet Zone NRQZ is a fixed 13,000 square mile rectangular area that covers portions of Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland and that provides interference protection to radio astronomy operations of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank, West Virginia, and the Naval Radio Research Observatory at Sugar Grove, West Virginia. See, e.g., 47 CFR  1.924a, 97.3a33 Service Rules for Advanced Wireless Services in the 1.7 GHz and 2.1 GHz Bands, WT Docket 02-353, Report and Order, 18 FCC Rcd 25162, 25175, para. 34 2003. 232 See NTIA Refresh PN Reply at 2. 519 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 for licensees in the band include passing a test or similar effort to promote awareness of radio astronomy sites.233 105. We seek comment on whether additional measures are necessary to protect radio astronomy and on NTIAs recommendations in this regard. We propose, consistent with NTIAs recommendations, to continue to apply the requirements of Footnote US211 in the 5030-5091 MHz band, to prohibit UAS operations within the NRQZ without prior coordination with the NRQZ administrator and, in the case of NNA operations relying on DFMS assignments, to require the submission of a concurrence from the NRQZ administrator with any request to a DFMS for frequency assignment within the NRQZ. We seek comment on these proposals. We note that section 1.924a of the Commissions rules establishes required procedures for licensees and applicants that seek to construct or operate new or modified fixed stations to coordinate their deployments in the NRQZ.234 Should we apply these licenseeapplicant procedures for the NRQZ to all UAS operations relying on the 5030-5091 MHz band in the NRQZ? To the extent we require NRQZ administrator concurrence for licensed-by-rule operations, we seek comment on the appropriate procedures to apply. To the extent measures beyond coordination and concurrence requirements for UAS operations are warranted, we seek comment on what other measures are practicable. 106. AeroMACS. AeroMACS is a broadband aeronautical mobile route service system that will enable communications for surface operations at airports between aircraft and other vehicles and between other critical fixed assets.235 The Commission has allocated both the 5000-5030 MHz and 5091- 5150 MHz bands for such use but has not yet established service rules in either band.236 107. We seek comment on whether any special measures are necessary to ensure compatibility between UAS operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band and AeroMACS. AIA indicates that RTCA is currently working on a revision to the AeroMACS technical standard, RTCA DO-346, that will ensure that future AeroMACS deployments will be compatible with CNPC links that are in compliance with RTCA DO-362A, and that no other special limitations on 5030-5091 MHz operations beyond compliance with RTCA DO-362A are necessary.237 More recently, RTCAs Program Management Committee PMC held its June 2022 meeting approving RTCA DO-346A with these revisions.238 We seek comment 233 See id. 234 See 47 CFR  1.924a establishing procedures for the NRQZ. 235 See Amendment of the Commissions Rules to Promote Aviation Safety et al., WT Docket No. 19-140 et al., Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 34 FCC Rcd 4984, 4997, para. 34 2019 Aviation NPRM. 236 See id. at 4997, para. 35. 237 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 11 stating that RTCA is acting on adjacent channel protections and recommends that no special limitation on 5030-5091 MHz operations are necessary to protect future AeroMACS deployments see also L3H Refresh PN Comments at 10 asserting that 5030-5091 MHz service compliance with the power restrictions and power spectral density limits in RTCA DO-362A should protect AeroMACS from harmful interference from UAS RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 7 stating that agreements are in the final implementation stages among RTCA special committees to modify the AeroMACS MOPS so that AeroMACS systems are compatible with DO-362A compliant CNPC radios that operate in the 5030-5091 MHz band Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 5 asserting that AeroMACS standard revision will address the adjacent band compatibility requirements and FCC service rules can be based on or refer to this standard for adjacent band interference limits RTCA DO-377A,  3.3.1.2 Based on the analysis in DO-362A . . . , the use of C-Band CNPC LOS radios for the C2 Link for surface operations will be compatible with AeroMACS in airports where AeroMACS service is available. It is understood that there will be an update to the AeroMACS radios, which will ensure that all AeroMACS airborne and ground radios emissions will not degrade the C Band C2 Link. see also RTCA DO-362A, Appx. T at T.3 specifying spatial separation, antenna orientations, and filtering criteria to protect AeroMACS operations. 238 See httpswww.rtca.orgnewsstandards-oversight-committee-acts-on-emerging-technologies-and-safety- oversight-2. 520 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 on whether the revised AeroMACS standard and compliance with the power and out-of-band emission limits of RTCA DO-362A are adequate measures to protect AeroMACS operations from harmful interference from 5030-5091 MHz UAS operations, and whether the revisions to the AeroMACS standard require specific service rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band. Should we adopt exclusion zones around airports with AeroMACS deployments, or prohibit use of a certain amount of spectrum at the edge of the 5030-5091 MHz band in the vicinity of such airports? 108. Radionavigation-satellite service. The 5010-5030 MHz band also includes an allocation for the radionavigation-satellite service RNSS space-to-Earth for potential future use.239 Footnote 5.443C of the Table of Frequency Allocations addresses requirements in the 5030-5091 MHz band for the protection of RNSS downlinks.240 Specifically, it provides that unwanted emissions from the aeronautical mobile R service in the frequency band 5030-5091 MHz shall be limited to protect RNSS system downlinks in the adjacent 5010-5030 MHz band and that until such time that an appropriate value is established in a relevant ITU-R Recommendation, the e.i.r.p. density limit of -75 dBWMHz in the frequency band 5010-5030 MHz for any AMRS station unwanted emission should be used.241 As CNPC services would be part of the AMRS allocation, this requirement applies to such services in the 5030-5091 MHz band. We propose to require 5030-5091 MHz operations to comply with the specific EIRP spectral density limit specified in Footnote 5.443C and seek comment on that proposal. Footnote 5.443C further limits AMRS use of the 5030-5091 MHz band to internationally standardized aeronautical systems.242 We seek comment on codifying this requirement as a service rule and on whether any other measure is necessary to implement the restriction. We further seek comment on whether any other special measures applicable to the 5030-5091 MHz band, such as a guard band at the bottom edge of the 5030-5091 MHz band, should be adopted to protect RNSS system downlinks.243 109. Flight testing. The 5091-5150 MHz band is also allocated for aeronautical mobile telemetry communications from aircraft stations, subject to the technical parameters in ITU Resolution 418 WRC-12 intended to ensure compatibility with other services.244 According to NTIA, federal agencies currently use this allocation in the 5091-5150 MHz band to support flight testing.245 We seek comment on whether measures beyond generally applicable out-of-band emissions limits are necessary to ensure that 5030-5091 MHz operations are compatible with such services. c. Canadian and Mexican Coordination 110. International agreements with Mexico and Canada do not address the use of the 5030- 5091 MHz band for UAS communications.246 In the event of any adjustments made to the agreements with Mexico or Canada regarding use of the 5030-5091 MHz band, we note that our proposed rules, and 239 See 47 CFR  2.106. 240 See 47 CFR  2.106, footnote 5.443C. 241 See id. Section 3 of the RTCA DO-362A standard requires the use of the EIRP density limit of -75 dBWMHz as specified in Footnote 5.443C. See RTCA DO-362A  3.2.1.4.6 see also id., Appx.

We seek comment on whether we should adopt an interim measure to address UAS communications in the 5030-5091 MHz band that may cause harmful interference to operations in Mexico or Canada during the period prior to any adjustments made to the agreements between the United States, Mexico, andor Canada regarding use of the band. If so, what should this interim measure provide? III. AIRBORNE USE OF FLEXIBLE-USE SPECTRUM 111. Beyond the development of the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS operations, the use of flexible-use spectrum247 and existing networks as platforms for UAS offers promise because these existing networks provide significant coverage with low latency, high throughput, and dedicated and secure communications. The use of such existing infrastructure may provide the added benefit of a near- term, low-cost option in comparison to building a dedicated network for UAS operations. 112. There is considerable interest in using existing terrestrial mobile networks for UAS communications, including command and control, telemetry, and payload communications. Because these networks were not designed for UAS use, however, the integration of UAS into terrestrial mobile networks may not be a seamless transition. The Commissions terrestrial mobile service rules generally do not consider airborne use, and whether within a network or across adjacent networks, the potential for increased interference is probable when UAS are introduced. 113. While the Commission remains committed to allowing flexibility in the use of existing spectrum and networks, we are uncertain about the potential interference impacts of UAS use. Therefore, we seek comment on the adequacy of current rules to ensure co-existence of existing terrestrial wireless networks and UAS and on the regulatory solutions that may be necessary to facilitate and encourage such use. Our action is consistent with WTB and OETs recommendation in the Section 374 Report to conduct further review of the flexible-use bands for UAS.248 A. Background 114. Federal agencies, industry stakeholders, and standards bodies have undertaken significant work to facilitate use of UAS, including development of flexible-use spectrum as a platform. As interest in and demand for UAS services grows, this initial work will form the foundation for the additional research and testing that is necessary to evaluate the need for further regulatory action by the Commission, where appropriate. 115. FAA Programs. As noted, the FAA has engaged in a variety of initiatives to safely integrate UAS into the National Airspace System, some of which considered the use of various spectrum bands as platforms for UAS. Among these initiatives, in 2017, the FAA established the UAS Integration Pilot Program IPP to permit state, local, and Tribal governments to partner with private sector entities, such as UAS operators or manufacturers, to accelerate safe UAS integration.249 IPP participants evaluated several operational concepts, including night-time operations, flights over people and beyond-visual-line- of-sight operations, package delivery, detect-and-avoid technologies, and link reliability.250 The IPP program concluded in October 2020 after which the FAA launched a new program called BEYOND, 247 The term flexible-use spectrum or flexible-use bands, refers to services or spectrum bands for which the Commissions rules do not prescribe specific uses or applications. 248 Section 374 Report, at 1. 249 See FAA, UAS Integration Pilot Program, httpswww.faa.govuasprograms_partnershipscompletedintegration_pilot_program last visited Sept. 6, 2022. 250 Id. 522 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 which is intended to continue the work of UAS integration.251 The FAA also chartered the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight Operations Aviation Rulemaking Committee BVLOS ARC in June 2021 to review insights gained from these and other activities and to provide recommendations regarding performance-based regulatory requirements that will enable the integration of beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations in the National Airspace System.252 In March 2022, the BVLOS ARC issued a Final Report, making over 70 recommendations regarding regulatory changes to facilitate such operations.253 The BVLOS ARC Final Report noted that reliable and continuous access to spectrum is essential to the continued growth of the UAS industry and that it is critical for all available communications technology to be enabled.254 116. Stakeholder Interest in UAS on Flexible-Use Spectrum. Manufacturers, service providers, and public and private UAS operators support using a wide range of bands for UAS operations in addition to spectrum bands dedicated to aeronautical use,255 and research is underway to study the potential of flexible-use spectrum for UAS uses. For example, in accordance with its Part 5 Program Experimental Radio License rules, the Commission in August 2021 approved the North Carolina State University Innovation Zone256 for use by the Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless AERPAW.257 The AERPAW testbed is the first research platform to study the use of 5G wireless technology as a platform for UAS.258 Several mobile service providers and other stakeholders currently are developing network-based UAS applications that would operate over commercial networks 251 See FAA, BEYOND, httpswww.faa.govuasprograms_partnershipsbeyond last visited Sept. 6, 2022. As part of the BEYOND program, the FAA is continuing its partnerships with eight of the nine IPP participants, which continue to test and refine varying UAS operational concepts.

UAS Standards. Standards bodies, such as 3GPP,263 are conducting ongoing studies to determine the extent of interference that may be caused by UAS operations within a terrestrial network, and to develop, as necessary, techniques to manage and mitigate the increased risk of harmful interference posed by UAS.264 As noted, 3GPP is developing updates to its standards to enable LTE wireless networks in flexible-use bands to support UAS applications.265 To this end, as part of Release 15 of the technical standard for Long Term Evolution LTE, 3GPP concluded a study item on the use of LTE for UAS, in which it proposed various interference mitigation strategies.266 118. The Commissions Technological Advisory Councils TAC267 Communication Strategies for Unmanned Aircraft working group was tasked with studying spectrum issues for UAS.268 Areas of review included the availability and sufficiency of spectrum for uses such as command-and- 259 See, e.g., CTA Section 374 Report Comments at 7-8 T-Mobile Section 374 Report Comments at 2 Verizon Section 374 Report Comments at 3-4, 7 CTIA Section 374 Report Reply at 5-6 UPS Section 374 Report Reply at 3- 4. 260 See Verizon Section 374 Report Comments at 7. 261 Id. 262 Verizon, Skyward and Federal Aviation Administration to test cellular-connected drones June 24, 2021, httpswww.verizon.comaboutnewsskyward-federal-aviation-administration-test-drones. 263 The 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP is an umbrella organization consisting of standards organizations that develop protocols for mobile telecommunications, including the Long-Term Evolution standard LTE.

Most recently, in June 2022, ANSI released an update to its Gaps Progress Report, which tracks efforts by standards developing organizations and others to address identified gaps where additional standardization work is needed.

The TAC is organized under the authority of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The current TAC, which is the FCCs 5th Technological Advisory Council, was formed on October 21, 2010. The TAC is comprised of a diverse array of leading experts that helps the FCC identify important areas of innovation and develop informed technology policies supporting Americas competitiveness and job creation in the global economy. httpswww.fcc.govgeneraltechnological-advisory-council. 268 See Technological Advisory Council  2019, Documents and White Paper Releases, 2019 TAC Working Groups and Charter, httpswww.fcc.govtechnological-advisory-council-2019. 524 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 control, payload, identification, and collision avoidance.269 The working group issued a series of reports in 2019, which concluded that flexible-use mobile networks using 3GPP technologies can satisfy communications requirements for low-altitude UA, but noted that interference remains a concern and an area for further study.270 The ITU has also studied spectrum issues for UAS,271 and IEEE has formed a technical committee related to aerial robotics and UAS.272 119. As discussed above, the RTCA is working with the FAA to develop industry-endorsed standards to enable UAS. In addition to developing MOPS for line-of-sight C2 transmissions for the 5030-5091 MHz band, RTCA Special Committee 228 is currently conducting work regarding cellular network standards for UAS.273 B. Applicable Spectrum Bands 120. The flexible-use spectrum landscape for potential UAS use is varied, consisting of bands that prohibit airborne use in the Table of Frequency Allocations or by rule and bands that are silent on airborne operation. For example, Parts 22 and 96 explicitly prohibit the airborne use of Cellular Radiotelephone Service and CBRS spectrum.274 Likewise, the Table of Frequency Allocations precludes aeronautical mobile use for several other spectrum bands, including all or portions of the 1670-1675 MHz, 1.4 GHz, 2.3 GHz Wireless Communications Service, and 3.7 GHz bands.275 Other flexible-use bands, however, are silent regarding airborne operations.276 We seek comment on the spectrum bands that might be utilized for UAS, as well as the spectrum bands that would not be suitable for such operation e.g., frequency bands with co-channel or adjacent channel services that require protection. 121. To inform our review, commenters should indicate the flexible-use bands in which they are currently operating or testing UAS. In addition, we ask commenters to detail the flexible-use bands that they may be interested in using for UAS in the future, including bands with and without explicit rules or allocations prohibiting airborne use. We also ask commenters to identify the type of communication 269 See Technological Advisory Council  2019, June 21, 2019 - Meeting of the Technological Advisory Council TAC, June 21, 2019, httpswww.fcc.govtechnological-advisory-council-2019. 270 See Technology Advisory Council, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Working Group presentations, Mar. 26, 2019, httpstransition.fcc.govoettactacdocsmeeting32619TAC-Presentations-3-26-19.pdf June 21, 2019, httpswww.fcc.govoettactacdocsmeeting62119TACPresentations6-21-19.pdf Dec. 4, 2019, httpswww.fcc.govoettactacdocsmeeting12419TAC-Presentations-12-4-19.pdf. 271 The ITU developed Report ITU-R M.2171 122009, titled, Characteristics of unmanned aircraft systems and spectrum requirements to support their safe operation in non-segregated airspace. The report addresses the anticipated needs of both terrestrial and satellite spectrum requirements for UAS. 272 According to the IEEE Aerial Robotics and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Committees website, The technical committee will promote exchanges among researchers from academia, industry and government. The purpose is to identify the technologies and technical approaches to advance and mature the field of aerial robotics. Exchanges include conferences, workshops, special sessions in conferences and publications to promote discussion on technical and applicative problems. Envisioned will be on-line and printed resources to disseminate knowledge including cross-disciplinary information like aerodynamics, propulsion, communications, controls and sensors.

C. Sufficiency of Existing Rules 122. Certain entities maintain that our existing service and technical rules for the various flexible-use bands are sufficient to address the potential for harmful interference from UAS operations.277 While our existing rules promote optimal flexibility for licensees, these rules are largely focused on terrestrial operations and were not designed with airborne operations in mind. Although studies are underway to develop techniques to manage and mitigate the increased risk of harmful interference posed by UAS, at this time it is unclear whether these mitigation techniques and standards enhancements would be sufficient to protect existing wireless users and adjacent service areaband licensees from harmful interference caused by UAS use. Further, the functionality exhibited by UAs may necessitate revising our rules to enable UAS operation on existing flexible-use networks. In light of these interference concerns, we seek comment on whether modifications to our rules to protect existing terrestrial and other airborne operations are warranted. 123. Interference mitigation. Use of flexible-use spectrum by UAS can raise interference problems for co-channel and potentially adjacent-channel operationsparticularly the high-density use that is expected to occur in the future. The impact of UAs on mobile networks is different than conventional mobile devices due to the high altitude and high mobility of UAs. The higher altitude of UAs means that they 1 can see and be seen by more base stations than a conventional mobile device and 2 have more favorable propagation conditions than propagation experienced by terrestrial operations. In addition, this high mobility, coupled with moving velocities up to 100 miles per hour under current FAA restrictions, can result in base station handoff issues and other network issues as described in detail below.278 These factors underlie two scenarios in which harmful interference can occur in the presence of UAS operating on flexible-use spectrumdownlink interference and uplink interference. 124. In the downlinkcommunications from the base station to UAsthe UAs may operate at an altitude that is within line of sight of multiple base stations and, as a result, the UAs can receive downlink interference from those base stations. Accordingly, UAs may experience more downlink interference than terrestrial user equipment because the enhanced propagation conditions and greater line- of-sight cause downlink interference resulting from the multiple base stations visible to, and attempting to connect to, the UA. The increased downlink interference leads to increased resource utilization levels in the network and eventually degrades the downlink performance of both airborne and terrestrial equipment.279 125. At the same time, in the uplinkcommunications from the UA to the base stationthe same UA can also cause interference to these multiple line-of-sight base stations. Uplink interference could increase as more UAs are introduced into the network. This interference may also increase depending on the UAs intended uses. For example, UAs may generate more uplink traffic than is typical of conventional mobile devices due to the use of data rate-intensive applications, such as video streaming and data streaming such applications increase spectrum demand and present an increased risk of uplink 277 See, e.g., CTIA Section 374 Report Comments at 14-17 Verizon Section 374 Report Reply Comments at 3-4 Letter from Jackie McCarthy, Assistant Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, CTIA to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC at 2-3 Dec. 20, 2019. 278 See 14 CFR  107.51a noting that the groundspeed of the small unmanned aircraft may not exceed 87 knots 100 miles per hour. 279 See, e.g., Xingqin Lin et al., The Sky is Not the Limit LTE for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, IEEE Communications Magazine, Vol. 56, No. 4, 205 April 2018 The Sky is Not the Limit LTE for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Siva D. Muruganathan et al., An Overview of 3GPP Release-15 Study on Enhanced LTE Support for Connected Drones, IEEE Communications Standards Magazine, Vol. 5, No. 4, 140 December 2021. 526 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 interference. The increased uplink interference from UAs affects the throughput performance of terrestrial user equipment as the number of UAs operating in a network increases, uplink resource utilization in the network also increases and at a greater rate than terrestrial-only operation. Eventually, the uplink performance of both UA and terrestrial equipment in the network is degraded. 126. To support use of UAS in terrestrial mobile networks, in 2017, 3GPP published a technical report TR36.777 investigating the ability for UAs to be served using terrestrial LTE networks.280 The reports findingswhich were based on the analysis of field trials performed by various companies analyzing LTE commercial network performance with the introduction of UAsvalidated that downlink and uplink interference may result from UAS operation.281 The report proposed various network and UA enhancements to minimize LTE throughput degradation and interference to the network and to UAs and terrestrial devices.282 127. TR36.777 confirmed the effect that UAS operations may have on downlink operations. The report observed that UAs uniformly distributed between 1.5 meters and 300 meters above ground level experienced downlink interference as a direct result of the UAs operating in the direct line-of-sight of more cells than terrestrial user equipment.283 This causes the UAs to receive downlink intercell interference from multiple cells.284 The resulting increase in resource utilization to provide for the introduction of UAs further decreases the spectral efficiency in the network and degrades downlink throughput performance of both UAs and terrestrial user equipment.285 128. The report similarly validated impacts on uplink interference. To this end, it also was observed that since the UAs experience line-of-sight propagation conditions to more cells than terrestrial devices, the UAs would cause interference to more cells in the uplink than a typical terrestrial device.286 The uplink interference caused by UAs degrades the throughput performance of terrestrial devices.287 The increase in resource utilization level further increases interference in the network, which in turn degrades the uplink throughput performance of both UAs and terrestrial user equipment.288 129. The report suggested several potential solutions to mitigate both uplink and downlink interference. Many of the solutions can be implemented by network providers independently and do not require an update to the 3GPP standard. To mitigate downlink interference, the report proposed the following solutions  Full-Dimensional MIMO FD-MIMO  This solution would use multiple antennas at the eNodeB base station transmitter to mitigate the interference in the downlink to UAs.289 FD- MIMO can also limit the mean terrestrial user equipment UE packet throughput loss.290 280 3rd Generation Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network Study on Enhanced LTE Support for Aerial Vehicles Release 15 3GPP TR 36.777 V15.0.0 2017-12 TR36.777 Report. While the TR36.777 Report uses the term aerial user equipment or aerial vehicles, for purposes of uniformity, we refer to aerial user equipment or vehicles as unmanned aircraft or UA. 281 See generally TR36.777 Report. 282 See generally TR36.777 Report. 283 TR36.777 Report at 12. 284 Id. 285 Id. at 13. 286 Id. 287 Id. 288 Id. 289 See TR36.777 Report at 15. 290 Id. 527 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101  Directional Antenna at UAs  Interference in the downlink can be mitigated by equipping UAs with a directional antenna instead of an omnidirectional antenna.291 A directional antenna can be used to mitigate the interference in the downlink to UAs by decreasing the interference power coming from a broad range of angles.292  Receive Beamforming at UAs  The UAs are assumed to be equipped with more than two receive antennas to mitigate the interference in the downlink to UAs.293 Downlink interference mitigation can be achieved in this case by using receive beamforming at UAs.294 In this solution, multiple cells belonging to the same site are coordinated and data is jointly transmitted to the UAs.295  Intra-site Joint Transmission Coordinated Multi-point Operation JT CoMP  In this solution, multiple cells are coordinated and data is jointly transmitted to the UAs.296  Coverage Extension  In this solution, coverage extension techniques via downlink shared channels, physical broadcast channels, and physical downlink shared channels are used to enhance synchronization and initial access for UAs.297 Because the UA is synchronized with the network, downlink interference is mitigated.298  Coordinated Data and Control Transmission  In this solution, multiple cells belonging to the same or different sites are coordinated.299 Data, common signalchannels e.g., synchronization signal and Physical Broadcast Channel PBCH, and control channels can be jointly transmitted to the UAs.300 The coordinated cells could construct a larger cell for UAs, and terrestrial user equipment is served by physical cells without coordination, 291 Id. 292 Id. 293 Id. 294 Id. 295 Id. 296 The TR36.777 Report details how this solution helps to mitigate downlink interference. From the results of the UAS testing done to support the study, it was observed that when the UA UE ratio is increased from 0 to 50 and when intra-site JT CoMP is employed in the case with 50 UA UE ratio, the mean packet throughput of all user equipment can be improved by 33.4 at low offered traffic load in a UMa-AV Urban Macro base stations mounted above buildings with UAs scenario. TR36.777 Report at 15. When the UA UE ratio remained fixed at 50 in UMa-AV scenario, employing intra-site JT CoMP can improve the mean packet throughput for all user equipment by 58.5 at low offered traffic load compared to the case where intra-site JT CoMP is not employed. TR36.777 Report at 15. 297 The TR36.777 Report explains how this solution helps to mitigate downlink interference. From the results of the UAS testing done to support the study, it was observed that a noticeable fraction of the UA UE in RMa-AV Rural Macro base stations located on top of towers with UAs and UMa-AV Urban Macro base stations mounted above buildings with UAs are not in coverage for synchronization and initial access. TR36.777 Report at 16. With LTE Rel-13 coverage extension techniques, the UAs in RMa-AV and UMa-AV can achieve synchronization and initial access with 100 coverage probability. TR36.777 Report at 16. 298 Id. 299 According to the TR36.777 Report, this solution helps to mitigate downlink interference as it was observed that the coordinated cells could construct a larger cell for UAs, and at the same time, terrestrial user equipment are served by physical cells without coordination.

The report proposed the following techniques to mitigate uplink interference  User Equipment Specific Fractional Pathloss Compensation Factor  In this solution, an enhancement to the existing open loop power control mechanism is considered where a device-specific fractional pathloss compensation factor is introduced.303  User Equipment Specific Power Output Parameter  Configuring a lower power output for UAs compared to terrestrial devices improves terrestrial uplink user equipment throughput performance.304 Such a configuration, however, reduces UA uplink throughput.305  Closed Loop Power Control  In this solution, the target received powers for the UAs are adjusted.306 By applying closed loop power control, mean terrestrial user equipment uplink throughput improvement can be improved.307  Full-Dimensional MIMO FD-MIMO  By using FD-MIMO with multiple antennas at the eNB receiver interference in the uplink can be mitigated.308 In addition, FD-MIMO can limit the mean terrestrial user equipment packet throughput loss.309 131. In addition to TR 36.777, 3GPP made changes to Technical Standard TS36.331 to help address UA interference to the base station. In LTE networks, measurement reports are messages sent from a UA to a base station that help the base station make network decisions.310 The changes to TS36.331 included measurement report triggers for two reporting events H1 above and H2 below UA height thresholds sent from the UA to the base station to help the base station see the UA and to deal with 301 Id. 302 Id. 303 From the results of the UAS testing done to support the study, it was observed that with the introduction of a user equipment specific fractional pathloss compensation factor, it is possible to configure UAs with a different factor compared to the fractional pathloss compensation factor configured to the terrestrial devices. TR36.77 Report at 16- 17. It was observed that with the UA ratio fixed at 50 in UMa-AV scenario, applying different fractional path loss compensation factors for UAs and terrestrial devices can result in significant user equipment packet throughput gains for terrestrial devices and significant user equipment packet throughput losses for UAs. TR36.777 Report at 16-17. Applying height dependent fractional pathloss compensation factors for UAs can result in significant user equipment packet throughput gains for terrestrial devices and notable UE packet throughput gains for UAs.

While the 3GPP TR 36.777 report concluded that it is feasible to use existing LTE networks to provide UA connectivity, the report and its findings have their limitations. The 3GPP quantitative analyses for Release 15 evaluated only the self-network performance impact of various potential solutions to interference detection and mitigation.313 Moreover, the technical solutions identified do not eliminate the interference from UAs, they merely reduce the levels of interference.314 The report also noted that interference challenges become more visible when the density of UAs increases.315 Beyond these limitations, the report did not evaluate the interference potential and impact on neighboring wireless networks or other radio services in the vicinity of UAS operation, nor did it evaluate the costs associated with the proposed technical solutions. As a result, there are open questions about the level of interference that licensees may experience and deem acceptable from neighboring licensees deploying UAS, the mitigation measures that may be necessary, and the costs licensees are willing to absorb to protect themselves from interference. Thus, the current 3GPP studies, while a valuable start, point to the need to address additional UAS interference issues. 133. Given that it appears that UAS operations within a single terrestrial mobile network will likely result in an increased level of intra-network interference and decreased network efficiency, it is also likely that adjacent markets and networks will be affected by UAS operations. While we seek to provide licensees with as much flexibility as possible to deploy a wide range of services and applications, including UAS, the increased risk of harmful interference from such operations is a concern. Neighboring licensees, whether they deploy or decide not to deploy UASairborne technologies, will be impacted and may be required to implement protections for their own networks. A difficult situation may arise for all parties when adjacent licenseesboth of which are operating within the Commissions rulesreach an impasse regarding interference, and the failure to reach a resolution may detrimentally affect operations for one or both licensees. 134. We seek comment on how licensees deploying UAS technologies could protect licensees in neighboring markets and neighboring spectrum bands from interference. Some flexible-use licensees planning to deploy airborne technology e.g., UAS may believe that such use is not problematic from an interference standpoint because they may assume that 1 all licensees will deploy the same technology, 2 all terrestrial networks are equally prepared to protect themselves, and 3 other potentially incompatible airborne technologies will not also be deployed. While this best-case scenario may turn out to be true as the market for airborne services develops, our rules must be expansive enough to account for 311 See 3GPP TS 36.331 V16.7.0 2021-12 3rd Generation Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access E-UTRA Radio Resource Control RRC Protocol specification Release 16 Section 5.5.4 - Measurement report triggering. 312 In Release 16, 3GPP completed a study into the potential requirements and use cases for Remote Identification of Unmanned Aerial Systems. See httpswww.3gpp.orguas-uav. The study also looked at the extent to which the 3GPP system can enable UAS components to establish the connectivity between each other and UAS Traffic Management UTM for both line-of-sight connectivity and non-line-of-sight connectivity, and on the detection and reporting of unauthorized UAs towards the UTM. See httpswww.3gpp.orguas-uav. In Release 17, 3GPP specifies additional capabilities which support UAS applications and requirements such as UA user authentication, UA tracking, and UA remote identification, among others. See 3rd Generation Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects Uncrewed Aerial System UAS Support in 3GPP Stage 1 Release 17 3GPP TS 22.125 V17.6.0 2022-03 Section 5  Requirements for Remote Identification of UAS includes tracking, and Section 7.3 - Positioning performance requirements. httpsportal.3gpp.orgdesktopmodulesSpecificationsSpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId3545.. 313 See generally TR36.777 Report. 314 See generally id. 315 See id. at 20. 530 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 the increased potential for harmful interference. Our rules should, at a minimum, set out a framework for UAS operations that is broad enough to account for varying interference scenarios. For these reasons, we seek comment on whether our rules can accommodate UAS operations while also protecting co-channel and adjacent band operations, including satellite operations, where permitted. In addition, we seek comment on changes to our rules that may be necessary to accommodate these scenarios. 135. For example, the power limitations for mobile devices vary depending on the service. For the PCS band, the limit is 2 Watts EIRP.316 Hand-held stations operating in the 698-757 MHz, 776- 788 MHz, 805-806 MHz, and 600 MHz uplink band are limited to 3 Watts ERP.317 Are these and other power limitations for mobile devices in the flexible-use bands appropriate for UAS operation? Considering the increased interference potential of UAS, should the power limitations for UAs be lower than for terrestrial devices? 136. Additionally, for many services, a licensees predicted or measured median field strength limit must be calculated and may not be exceeded at any given point along its service area boundary.318 These limits were developed considering only terrestrial devices.319 With the introduction of UAS, how will licensees ensure these boundary limits are not exceeded? Are the current limits320 sufficient to protect the boundary of a neighboring licensee on the same or adjacent channel block? Can a UAS report and store power control and location metrics to ensure boundary limits are not exceeded?321 137. As noted, the higher the altitude at which UAs are operating, the greater the number of line of sight paths between a UA and surrounding base stations, and thus the greater the potential impact on adjacent networks. We seek comment on the altitudes that are being considered for UA operations involving flexible-use spectrum. Will operations on these bands likely be limited to low altitudes such as 400 feet AGL, or is it anticipated that UAS use on flexible-use bands will include operations at higher altitudes such as 10,000 feet AGL or greater? Given the increased potential for interference at high altitudes, should the Commission impose altitude restrictions on UAS operations using flexible-use spectrum? 138. Further, it is not clear whether existing out-of-band emissions rules adequately account for the favorable line-of-sight propagation conditions associated with UAS. Should such rules be modified to account for UAS operations in flexible-use spectrum, and if so, how? We seek comment on these and other technical rules that should be evaluated and perhaps revised to facilitate the use of flexible-use bands for UAS. 139. To inform our analysis regarding whether rule revisions may be necessary, we seek technical studies and analyses regarding the potential for UAS operations to cause interference to adjacent channel, adjacent band, or adjacent market operations. Among other issues, these studies and analyses should address how licensees deploying UAS technologies plan to protect terrestrial or satellite licensees in neighboring markets or spectrum bands from harmful interference. We request comment on the challenges and issues that carriers have experienced when testing or deploying UAS operations relative to the carriers own terrestrial wireless network. What solutions have carriers developed or are carriers 316 47 CFR  24.232c. 317 47 CFR  27.50b10, c10. 318 See, e.g., 47 CFR  24.236, 27.55a. 319 In general, the geographic area licensees service area power limits in sections 22.913b and 27.55d and e of the Commissions rules that are measured at a height 1.6 meters above ground level to estimate the height of a mobile UE taking into account terrain obstacles.

What UAS altitude and UA density assumptions have been used to analyze deployment challenges and protection of neighbors? Are these solutions to be implemented applicable to the UA, or are they network-based? For licensees employing LTE, can the solutions identified in the 3GPP TR36.777 Report be applied to resolve interference issues within the network and to adjacent networks? Given that flexible-use spectrum licensees may deploy networks other than LTE, what additional interference issues may be encountered and what are the technical solutions that could be applied, given that there may be varying levels of compatibility with airborne technologies? We note that some areas, such as Quiet Zones require the application of more stringent measures to reduce the potential for interference322 how will licensees continue to protect such areas when operating at higher altitudes?323 Are there network-based solutions being developed that could prevent individual UAs from approaching or entering such noise-sensitive locations or other restricted areas that would mitigate the potential for UAs to cause interference or endanger safety of life and property in such areas? We also seek comment on any other regulatory matters that may be affected by UAS operations. For example, will UASairborne technologies affect other regulatory requirements like 911 location accuracy? 140. Different Use Cases. Our regulatory approach with respect to flexible-use bands is to provide licensees with sufficient flexibility to choose the services that they wish to provide. Licensees could offer a wide range of services and applications, ranging from conventional C2 and payload offerings to UTM management services. This ability of licensees to engage in a wide range of use cases creates additional technical uncertainty when deploying UAS operations. We seek comment on the airborne use cases that commenters are considering for flexible-use spectrum. Is there a need for specific rules to permit different applications? Further, should licensees that incorporate UAS operations be required to meet different limitations than what currently exist? 141. One application being explored is the use of UAs as airborne base stations.324 HAPS systems can potentially be used to provide both fixed broadband connectivity for end users and transmission links between the mobile and core networks for backhauling traffic. As noted, the Commissions rules as well as ITU Radio Regulations define HAPS as radio stations located on an object at an altitude of 12-31 miles 20-50 kilometers and at a specified, nominal, fixed point relative to the Earth.325 142. We note that the Commission is currently considering whether HAPS or other stratospheric-based services could be used in any portion of the 71-76 GHz, 81-86 GHz, 92-94 GHz, and 94.1-95 GHz 708090 GHz bands to provide or support broadband Internet access.326 Are there 322 Section 1.924 of the Commissions rules identifies areas in which it is necessary to restrict transmissions to minimize impact on radio astronomy or other facilities that are highly sensitive to interference. 47 CFR  1.924 see also supra para. 105. 323 See, e.g., 47 CFR  27.1134 Protection of Federal Government operations. 324 See, e.g., Steve McCaskill, Aerial base station delivers 4G coverage from the Earth's stratosphere Oct. 20, 2020, httpswww.techradar.comnewsaerial-base-station-delivers-4g-coverage-from-the-earths-stratosphere Miriam McNabb, AeroVironment to Develop High Altitude Solar Drones Jan. 3, 2018, httpsdronelife.com20180103aerovironment-develop-high-altitude-solar-drones. 325 47 CFR  2.1 accord ITU R.R., Article 1.66A 2020 see supra para. 98. 326 See Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Seeks To Supplement the Record on 708090 GHz Bands Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking, Public Notice, DA 21-1263 WTB Oct. 8, 2021.

If so, what rule changes or regulatory considerations would be necessary to permit such uses? 143. Other examples of airborne base station platforms include the use of tethered UAS, which typically are UAs physically connected to the ground via cables that provide power and data links to the UAs.328 We are aware that there has been research and development in the use of tethered UAS as temporary base stations, particularly as part of disaster recovery efforts.329 What issues are raised by the use of tethered UAS temporary base stations? If the station is essentially functioning as a conventional base station, should the existing rules applicable to the particular band be applied? Or is it necessary to apply other service and technical parameters, e.g., antenna height and power output? What additional concerns are raised where tethered UAS base stations as well as HAPS are deployed? Further, what would be the impact of a mobile airborne base station on airborne user equipment i.e., UAS? What changes or additions to our rules are necessary to address such concerns? 144. Elimination of Rules Which Impede UAS. In its Final Report, the BVLOS ARC recommended that the Commission reconsider the restrictions on airborne use that apply to certain spectrum bands.330 The BVLOS ARC Final Report noted that beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations require that spectrum bands with appropriate characteristics are sufficiently available to meet the needs of numerous users operating in a variety of operating environments.331 Similarly, the TAC has noted that the Commission should reassess the technical basis for prohibiting use of certain terrestrial mobile bands above ground level.332 To the extent that measures can be identified that resolve or mitigate the impact of UAS use on adjacent operations, we seek comment on whether current prohibitions on airborne operations should be removed. For example, the Cellular Radiotelephone Service airborne use prohibition in section 22.925 was put in place specifically because of the heightened risk of interference by airborne mobiles to cellular networks. Can such operations be protected in the presence of UAS use? If solutions are developed that effectively mitigate the increased potential for harmful interference posed by UAS use, should UAS operations be permitted in Cellular Radiotelephone Service or other bands? Are there certain noise-restricted bands that must retain the prohibition regardless of any UAS 327 We observe that the Commission has previously granted experimental authorizations for high-altitude testing using flexible-use spectrum. See, e.g., Physical Science LaboratoryNew Mexico State University, Special Temporary Authorization, OET Experimental Licensing System File No. 0020-EX-CM-2022 Loon, LLC, Special Temporary Authorization, OET Experimental Licensing System File No. 0609-EX-CN-2020. 328 See Mustafa A.

Canadian and Mexican Coordination. The use of UAS will likely have an impact in areas beyond United States borders. There are several agreements that address use of the flexible-use bands in the border regions between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.334 These agreements do not contemplate UAS use. Because UAS operation in these bands would increase the interference potential in the border regions, commenters should be aware that UAS use may not be permitted in border areas until such time as the agreements are updated to accommodate such use, or agreements on such use are reached with both countries. We seek comment on how to address issues arising from UAS use in the border regions pending any changes to existing agreements. D. UAS Impact on Spectrum Rights 146. The Commissions rules largely presume that wireless networks are terrestrial in nature, which raises questions regarding the extent of spectrum rights granted as part of existing commercial authorizations. Pursuant to the Communications Act and the Commissions rules, the Commission grants licensees the right to operate radio systems on a particular radio frequency.335 In some services, such as those with allocations prohibiting aeronautical mobile use, it can be presumed that a licensee only has rights with respect to ground-based operations.336 Likewise, other services have technical rules which suggest that only terrestrial networks were contemplated for those services.337 By contrast, rules for geographic market-based licenses define market areas according to geographic boundaries, but they are silent as to the vertical scope of such markets.338 The Commission has never explicitly stated what it believes to be the vertical limit of a licensees spectrum rights, leaving a question as to the ceiling of license areas and the attendant protections associated with these geographic markets. As the interference discussion above highlights, however, market boundaries become crucial at higher altitudes. 147. The ability of a licensee to exercise or protect its spectrum rights with respect to adjacent licensees becomes relevant in the context of UAS use, given that the operation of UAs well within the 333 There are restrictions on aeronautical or airborne mobile use in or adjacent to noise-restricted bands. For example, in the 1670-1675 MHz band, aeronautical mobile is prohibited to protect radio astronomy operations. See 47 CFR  2.106, footnotes US211, US342. 334 See, e.g., Canada Agreements By Frequency, httpswww.fcc.govcanadian-agreements-frequency, 700 MHz Commercial Land Mobile Agreement with Canada, Understanding Concerning Cellular Radio Systems in the bands 824-825 MHz, 845-849 MHz, 869-870 MHz, and 890-894 MHz, Personal Communications Service PCS- Broadband Mexico Agreements By Frequency, httpswww.fcc.govmexican-agreements-frequency, Cellular Protocol 4, Personal Communication Service PCS-Broadband 8. 335 47 U.S.C.  303 47 CFR  1.903. 336 Several allocations in the Table of Frequency Allocations, including 1670-1675 MHz, 2305-2310 MHz, 2495- 2690 MHz and 3550-3700 MHz bands, permit primary non-Federal mobile, except aeronautical mobile, operations. 47 CFR  2.106. 337 For example, PCS service rules specify maximum antenna height and output power of base stations. 47 CFR  24.232. In the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, license areas are determined by a licensees Cellular Service Area Boundary SAB, which is the area around a base station transmitter within which a subscriber can receive a specific signal level. See 47 CFR  22.911. The license area defined by this service contour is, in essence, a dome around the transmitter. Id. 338 See, e.g., 47 CFR  24.202, 27.6. A geographic market licensee generally may construct a transmitter tower anywhere within a particular geographic areas boundary subject to certain interference protection and other technical requirements and does not need to apply for prior Commission approval of specific transmitter locations. See, e.g., 47 CFR  27.11a Applications for individual sites are not required and will not be accepted, except where required for environmental assessments, in accordance with  1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter. 47 CFR  90.663. 534 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 boundaries of one license area can affect and be affected by base stations located inside the boundaries of another license areamore so than for conventional mobile operation. UAs will have line-of-sight connectivity to base stations both within the geographic market area where the UA is flying, as well as base stations in other adjacent geographic areas. The potential for a UA to establish a network connection with a base station in an adjacent market causes a tension between Commission policies 1 a licensees authorization generally provides the licensee exclusive use of the spectrum within its licensed market area and 2 historically, our rules consider mobile devices to be operating under the authority of the licensee whose transmitter is providing service. UA operation creates a tension between these two policies because a UA can be served by a transmitter that is well outside of the licensees market boundary.339 The greater line-of-sight of UAs could extend the reach of a transmitter further into an adjacent market, thus muddling the concept of license exclusivity. 148. This aspect of UAS use raises questions regarding how and under what circumstances a licensee is able to enforce rights under its license.340 For example, it may be difficult to determine UAS operation as a cause of interference to a network because such operation is intermittent and because the effect may vary depending on the position and movement of the UA. Moreover, even if UAS operation is determined to be a cause of interference, the offending licensee is likely to be operating within the Commissions rules regarding conventional mobile operations. This poses questions regarding the circumstances under which the victim licensee, i.e., the licensee experiencing harmful interference, may seek relief from the Commission where both entities are compliant with service rules. 149. Accordingly, we seek comment on whether the Commission should identify a vertical limit at which flexible-use licenses may be used to support UAS on an exclusive or primary basis. Use beyond this limit would be on a non-primary basis. Non-primary in this context would mean that a licensee would be required to cure harmful interference to an adjacent licensee caused by its UAS operation even if it is operating within the rules.341 First, is it appropriate to establish a vertical limit for primary UAS operations in our rules? If we adopt a limit, what should that limit be? What factors should the Commission consider regarding a vertical limit for licensed UAS operations? 150. Second, we seek comment on how to determine whether a licensee should be required to cure harmful interference caused by its non-primary operations to adjacent licensees even if it is operating within the service rules for the license. How should we determine whether an entity should be obligated to take corrective measures, as there may be scenarios in which it could be difficult to determine fault? We request comment on how licensees should be able to enforce their license rights. What interference resolution mechanism would be appropriate? IV. LICENSING UAS OPERATORS FOR VHF COMMUNICATIONS 151. The aeronautical VHF band 117.975 MHz -137 MHz is used by aviation for air traffic control and advisory communications among other aviation-safety purposes.342 In some instances, to ensure the safety of the National Airspace System, the FAA requires operators of UAS to communicate 339 In the current mobile environment this happens to a limited extent at a market boundary. Currently, base stations situated along a market boundary can serve a conventional mobile located close to the boundary in the adjacent market this is beneficial to both licensees as it permits continued service and seamless handoff across boundaries. UA, however, could be served by base stations well within the adjacent market boundary due to a greater line-of- sight. 340 See Technological Advisory Committee, UAS Working Group March 26, 2019 Presentation, httpstransition.fcc.govoettactacdocsmeeting32619TAC-Presentations-3-26-19.pdf last visited June 14, 2022. 341 Non-primary status would not mean that a licensee would not have interference protection for its own operation. The non-primary status would only convey responsibility for curing interference even if that licensee is operating within rules. 342 See 47 CFR  87.173b Review of Part 87 of the Commissions Rules Concerning the Aviation Radio Service, WT Docket No. 01-289, Third Report and Order, 25 FCC Rcd 7610, 7612, para. 3 2010. 535 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 with air traffic control ATC facilities when operating on or in the vicinity of an airport or operating in controlled airspace over the VHF traffic control and advisory frequencies.343 To meet this requirement, operators may use a VHF station integrated into the UA itself whereby the UAS operators control station connects with the UA using a non-VHF channel and the UA completes the connection to ATC over the normal VHF channels. This approach is commonly referred to as ATC relay.344 Implementation of ATC relay in UA technology is still nascent and UAS operators have, therefore, continued to rely on ground- based VHF stations. The part 87 aviation service rules governing the use of the aeronautical VHF band do not, however, provide a licensing mechanism for the operator of a UAS to obtain a ground-based station license.345 Accordingly, UAS operator requests for such authorization are currently handled by special temporary authority on a case-by-case basis. We propose to establish a mechanism by which UAS operators may apply for a regular license for this purpose, with appropriate requirements, restrictions, and conditions to maintain the integrity of the band and service legitimate needs for flight coordination. 152. Although aeronautical VHF stations are generally licensed by rule under part 87 if the aircraft does not make international flights or communications,346 we do not propose to authorize ground- based VHF stations under a licensed-by-rule approach. Rather, under our proposal, we would require operators to file a license application with the Commission for an individual license covering their VHF station. According to the FAA, there were over 200,000 private aircraft registered in the United States as of 2020 and were over 7,000 commercial aircraft as of 2019, numbers which are expected to remain relatively stable to the year 2040.347 In contrast, the recreational UAS fleet is expected to grow from the current 1.32 million units to approximately 1.48 million units by 2024.348 The FAA also forecasts that, by the year 2024, the commercial UAS fleet will likely be twice as large as the current fleet of approximately 385,000 UAS.349 Given the potential number of UAS operators, we have concerns that a licensed-by-rule 343 See 14 CFR  91.126 Operating on or in the vicinity of an airport in Class G airspace, 91.183 IFR communications see also, e.g., Supplemental Statement of BNSF Railway Co., FCC File No. 0008476737, at 1 filed Dec. 20, 2018, available at last visited June 14, 2022 stating that the ability for BNSF to have active participation on the proposed aviation channels is of major importance to the FAA and that the FAA has requested BNSF obtain an aircraft stations license from the FCC that will be used to communicate directly to ATC see also FAA Order JO 7210.3CC  Facility Operation and Administration, at 5-5-3b, httpswww.faa.govair_trafficpublicationsatpubsfoa_htmlchap5_section_5.html last visited June 14, 2022 providing that the Operations SupervisorController-in-Charge OSCIC should ensure . . . if known, that the controller has a method of contacting the appropriate UAS pilot-in-command. 344 For example, the technical standard RTCA DO-362A would potentially provide for the use of CNPC links in the 5030-5091 MHz band to support the link between operator and UA for purposes of ATC relay. See RTCA DO- 362A,  1.1. and B.3.1.2. 345 This issue does not arise for pilots aboard manned aircraft, who use stations for VHF communications under subpart F of part 87 of the Commissions rules. See 47 CFR pt. 87, subpt. F. Subpart F authorizes aircraft stations, which, as mentioned earlier, are defined as stations located on board an aircraft. 47 CFR  87.5, 87.185a. Because ground stations are not located on board an aircraft, they are not covered by subpart F. 346 See 47 CFR  87.18b. 347 See FAA, FAA Aerospace Forecast Fiscal Years 2020-2040 at 26, 32, httpswww.faa.govdata_researchaviationaerospace_forecastsmediaFY2020-40_FAA_Aerospace_Forecast.pdf last visited June 14, 2022 FAA Aerospace Forecast. While the private aircraft fleet is expected to slightly decrease, the number of flight hours is expected to increase. Id. at 26, 27. The commercial fleet is expected to grow by approximately 1 per year. Id. at 32. 348 Id. at 49. 349 Id. at 52. 536 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 approach applied to these operators stations in the VHF band could endanger this critical and limited amount of aeronautical spectrum and the safety of the National Airspace System. 153. In addition, given the wide availability of inexpensive, off-the-shelf VHF hand-held radios that can be easily operated without training, we are concerned about the greater potential for parties to obtain and use ground stations on a licensed-by-rule basis to contact ATC, because they may not have adequate training for such communications. We are further concerned that licensed-by-rule operators would be difficult to identify during communications with ATC or afterwards in the event of problems. We tentatively conclude that ground stations for VHF communications should not be licensed by rule, and seek comment on our analysis and tentative conclusion.350 154. While we typically do not individually license aircraft stations operating on VHF for domestic flights and communications, we seek comment on licensing ATC relay operations. As discussed above, ATC relay implementation is currently in its nascent stage, however we expect relay operations to increase with a corresponding increase in UA operations near airports and in controlled airspace. Given that ATC relay and ground-based VHF stations will both be used to communicate with ATC, are there inherent differences between ground radio operators and relay operators for the purpose of the communications? Is there a reason to expect operators using ATC relay stations are better trained for such communications? Are there other licensing related issues that we should consider that make relay systems unique? 155. We seek to adopt a licensing mechanism that addresses these concerns and maintains the integrity of the band while also meeting the legitimate needs of certain UAS operators for communications in the VHF band. To achieve these goals, we propose several measures below. We seek comment on these measures, and on any alternative approaches that would provide a regular licensing mechanism that meets the Commissions goals. 156. First, we propose to individually license ground stations for UAS operator communication with control towers and other aircraft pilots under a new category of licensed station, an Unmanned Aircraft Operator VHF Ground Station, and to define the new station as a station on the ground providing unmanned aircraft pilot radio communication relating to safety and regularity of flight on air traffic control, flight service station, unicom, or multicom frequencies.351 Individual licensing will enable the Commission to identify authorized operators, identify unauthorized users, and aid in resolving instances of harmful interference. Accordingly, under this proposal, parties will be required to submit individual license applications. We propose that parties use the FCC Form 605, which is used generally for, inter alia, authorizations for stations in the aircraft service, and we seek comment on whether any modifications to the form are necessary or helpful to facilitate its use for this purpose.352 157. Second, we propose to provide that these stations may operate over all air traffic control, flight service station, aeronautical advisory station unicom, and aeronautical multicom station 350 We also note that section 307e of the Act expressly limits licensing by rule in the aviation service to aircraft stations and, as discussed, we seek to adopt a licensing mechanism for VHF ground stations. See 47 U.S.C.  307e. 351 A flight service station is part of a network of stations providing weather briefings and information on flight facilities and monitoring the navigational radio net. See Review of Part 87 of the Commission's Rules Concerning the Aviation Radio Service, WT Docket No. 01-289, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making, 18 FCC Rcd 21432, 21459, para. 56, n.209 2003. A unicom station is an aeronautical station used for advisory and civil defense communications primarily with private aircraft. 47 CFR  87.5. A multicom station is an aeronautical station used to provide communications to conduct the activities being performed by, or directed from, private aircraft. Id. 352 FCC Form 605 provides a quick-form application for authorization for, among others, stations in the aircraft service generally. See FCC Form 605, httpswww.fcc.govfcc-form-605. 537 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 multicom channels authorized for use by aircraft.353 We seek comment on which specific channels to cover for this purpose.354 158. Third, we propose to permit mobile stations stations intended to be used while in motion or during halts at unspecified points, and we further seek comment on whether to permit non-mobile stations as well. To the extent parties support the inclusion of non-mobile stations, we seek comment on whether coverage of such stations for communications between two non-mobile sites i.e., the operators fixed VHF station and air traffic control is consistent with the aeronautical mobile and aeronautical mobile route allocations applicable to the air traffic control frequencies.355 159. Fourth, we propose to require that license applications include an endorsement from the FAA. An endorsement must be included in a written document issued by the FAA, such as a Certificate of Approval COA. We propose to provide that a license will not be issued without an FAA endorsement. We further propose that the approved license will be subject to any restrictions or conditions specified on the FAA endorsement. While licenses under part 87 are normally issued for 10 years, we seek comment on whether to provide that license terms for these stations will be the lesser of 10 years or the duration of the FAA endorsement, if any is specified. We further seek comment on whether a party seeking license renewal should be required to submit a new FAA written endorsement. 160. Finally, we propose to adopt a clarification of section 87.18 that will make clear that licensing by rule continues to apply to UAS aircraft stations, such as the VHF stations used for ATC relay. As discussed above, while we seek comment on whether the concerns that underlie our proposal that a UAS operators ground-based VHF stations should be individually licensed warrant the same approach for UAS aircraft stations, we are not proposing at this time to require individual licensing for those UAS aircraft stations used for VHF communications. To avoid any confusion as to the continued application of licensing by rule to such stations that might result from our proposal to license a UAS operators ground-based VHF station individually, we propose to clarify in section 87.18b that licensing by rule applies to aircraft stations, whether manned or unmanned. 161. We believe these steps will help to promote the safe integration of UAS into the National Airspace System, while maintaining the integrity of the aeronautical VHF band. We request comment on these proposals and alternatives. We seek comment on whether a provision enabling UAS operators to license ground-based stations to communicate over the aeronautical VHF band is necessary or if instead we should continue to address requests for authorization for ground-based stations on a case-by-case basis. If providing a mechanism for licensing of ground-based VHF stations is warranted, we seek comment on whether the proposed rules adequately address this need or unduly restrict the ability of UAS operators to communicate with ATC or with manned aircraft. Conversely, we seek comment on whether the proposal is too broad, and whether we should further restrict the circumstances under which UAS operators may obtain licensed ground stations to use the aeronautical VHF band. We also request comment on whether the FAAs planned integration of the Next Gen Data Communications system into the 136-137 MHz band or other innovations have any current or future effect on this need, including whether they may alter the frequencies that a future UAS operator needs to use to communicate with ATC or otherwise warrant modifications to our proposal.356 162. We further seek comment on the appropriate technical and operational requirements for the new category of station, and whether we should generally require such stations to comply with the technical and operational requirements applicable to aircraft stations licensed in the same frequency, or if 353 See 47 CFR  87.173b see also 47 CFR subpts. G, H. 354 See 47 CFR  87.173b, 87.187a, 87.187y2 flight service station frequencies. 355 See 47 CFR  2.106. For example, the aeronautical mobile service allocation covers mobile service between aeronautical i.e., ground stations and aircraft stations, or between aircraft stations, and does not expressly encompass service between two fixed stations. 47 CFR  2.1. 356 See, e.g., Aviation NPRM, 34 FCC Rcd at 4995-96, paras. 31-32. 538 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 any additional or alternate requirements should be adopted. In particular, we note that, under section 87.89 of the Commissions rules, operators of aviation service stations are generally required to hold a commercial radio operator license or permit, and that the operator license or permit requires passing a requisite knowledge test.357 The rule also specifies, however, that no operator license is required to operate a VHF telephony transmitter providing domestic service or used on domestic flights.358 We seek comment on whether a UAS operators VHF communications with ATC would constitute the operation of a VHF telephony transmitter providing domestic service or used on domestic flights, and if so, whether we should create an exception to this provision and provide that UAS operators that operate a licensed Unmanned Aircraft Operator Ground VHF Station must have a commercial radio operator license. Should we specify an alternative permit or training requirement for such operators? 163. Digital Equity and Inclusion. Finally, the Commission, as part of its continuing effort to advance digital equity for all,359 including people of color, persons with disabilities, persons who live in rural or Tribal areas, and others who are or have been historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality, invites comment on any equity-related considerations360 and benefits if any that may be associated with the proposals and issues discussed herein. Specifically, we seek comment on how our proposals in this NPRM may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, as well the scope of the Commissions relevant legal authority.

As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended RFA,1 the Commission has prepared this present Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFA of the possible significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NPRM. Written public comments are requested on this IRFA. Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for comments provided in the NPRM. The Commission will send a copy of the NPRM, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration SBA.2 In addition, the NPRM and IRFA or summaries thereof will be published in the Federal Register.3 A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules 2. The NPRM in this proceeding acts, in part, on a February, 2018 petition for rulemaking by the Aerospace Industries Association AIA, which recommended that the Commission adopt licensing and service rules for control and non-payload communications CNPC links in the 5030-5091 MHz band to support unmanned aircraft system UAS operations in the United States. In addition, on August 20, 2021, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology jointly submitted to Congress a report on behalf of the Commission addressing the matters specified in Section 374 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act. The report included their finding that the 5030-5091 MHz band appears to offer promise for intensive UAS use because it is unencumbered and recommended that the Commission initiate a rulemaking proceeding to develop service and licensing rules enabling UAS use of the band in collaboration with the FAA and NTIA. 3. The NPRM now proposes and seeks comment on several rule amendments to address the growing need of the operators of UAS for access to licensed spectrum. Together, the proposals and the measures upon which the NPRM seeks comment will help further the development and promote the growth and safety of UAS operations. 4. First, the NPRM addresses the 5030-5091 MHz band, which the Commission previously allocated to support terrestrial control links for UAS without adopting service rules. Because technical work regarding UAS is still in a nascent stage, the Commission anticipates that service rules sufficient to facilitate UAS operations will likely require development in phases. It now takes the first step to develop such rules. The NPRM seeks comment on service rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band that will provide UAS operators with access to licensed spectrum with the reliability necessary to support safety-critical UAS communications links. The Commissions objective in this proceeding is to provide UAS operators with access to an additional spectrum resource that may complement other spectrum resources that are currently available or in development. Although existing networks operating in other bands such as flexible-use bands may provide sufficient reliability for many UAS use cases, authorization of the 5030- 5091 MHz band for UAS use offers an opportunity to apply standards and rules designed to meet the most safety-critical communications needs. 5. Second, due to the increasing interest in operating UAS using existing terrestrial flexible- use spectrum networks, the NPRM seeks comment on whether the Commissions rules are adequate to ensure co-existence of terrestrial mobile operations and UAS use or whether changes to our rules are necessary. To this end, it seeks comment on the sufficiency of the current flexible-use rules to prevent 1 See 5 U.S.C.  603. The RFA, 5 U.S.C.  601-612, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 SBREFA, Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 1996. 2 See 5 U.S.C.  603a. 3 See id. 550 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 interference to and from UAS operations, and on whether the Commission can eliminate the current prohibitions on airborne operations applicable to certain of these flexible-use bands. 6. Third, to further promote the safe integration of unmanned aircraft operations in controlled airspace and facilitate flight coordination, the NPRM proposes a process for UAS operators to obtain a VHF license to communicate with air traffic control and other aircraft. In some instances, to ensure the safety of the National Airspace System, the FAA has required operators of UAS to communicate with air traffic control facilities or nearby manned aircraft over the VHF traffic control and advisory frequencies and to obtain a license from the FCC for this purpose. The part 87 aviation service rules do not, however, provide a mechanism for the operator of a UAS to obtain such a license. UAS operator requests for such authorization are currently handled by special temporary authority on a case- by-case basis. The proposed rule will enable UAS operators to obtain a regular license for this purpose. B. Legal Basis 7. The proposed action is authorized pursuant to Sections 1, 4, 301, 303, 307-310, 316, 318, and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  151, 154, 301, 303, 307-310, 316, 318, and 332. C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed Rules Will Apply 8. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.4 The RFA generally defines the term small entity as having the same meaning as the terms small business, small organization, and small governmental jurisdiction.5 In addition, the term small business has the same meaning as the term small-business concern under the Small Business Act.6 A small-business concern is one which 1 is independently owned and operated 2 is not dominant in its field of operation and 3 satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.7 9. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions. Our actions, over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present. We therefore describe here, at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.8 First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, according to data from the Small Business Administrations SBA Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.9 These types of small businesses represent 99.9 of all businesses in the United States, which translates to 32.5 million businesses.10 4 See id.  603b3. 5 See id.  6016. 6 See id.  6013 incorporating by reference the definition of small-business concern in the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C.  632. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  6013, the statutory definition of a small business applies unless an agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definitions in the Federal Register. 7 See 15 U.S.C.  632. 8 See 5 U.S.C.  6013-6. 9 See SBA, Office of Advocacy, Frequently Asked Questions, What is a small business?, httpscdn.advocacy.sba.govwp-contentuploads20211103093005Small-Business-FAQ-2021.pdf. Nov 2021. 10 Id. 551 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 10. Next, the type of small entity described as a small organization is generally any not- for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.11 The Internal Revenue Service IRS uses a revenue benchmark of 50,000 or less to delineate its annual electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.12 Nationwide, for tax year 2020, there were approximately 447,689 small exempt organizations in the United States reporting revenues of 50,000 or less according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.13 11. Finally, the small entity described as a small governmental jurisdiction is defined generally as governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.14 U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census of Governments15 indicate that there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.16 Of this number there were 36,931 general purpose governments county,17 municipal, and town or township18 with populations of less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments - independent school districts19 with enrollment 11 5 U.S.C.  6014. 12 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C  6015 that is used to define a small governmental jurisdiction. Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number of small organizations in this small entity description. See Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt Organizations  Form 990-N e-Postcard,httpswww.irs.govcharities-non-profitsannual-electronic-filing- requirement-for-small-exempt-organizations-form-990-n-e-postcard. We note that the IRS data does not provide information on whether a small exempt organization is independently owned and operated or dominant in its field. 13 See Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract EO BMF, CSV Files by Region, httpswww.irs.govcharities-non-profitsexempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf. The IRS Exempt Organization Business Master File EO BMF Extract provides information on all registered tax- exemptnon-profit organizations. The data utilized for purposes of this description was extracted from the IRS EO BMF data for businesses for the tax year 2020 with revenue less than or equal to 50,000, for Region 1-Northeast Area 58,577, Region 2-Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes Areas 175,272, and Region 3-Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast Areas 213,840 which includes the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii.

Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite. This industry comprises establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide communications via the airwaves.22 Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and wireless video services.23 The SBA size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.24 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.25 Of that number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 employees.26 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 797 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of wireless services.27 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 715 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.28 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities. 13. Satellite Telecommunications. This industry comprises firms primarily engaged in providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or reselling satellite telecommunications.29 Satellite telecommunications service providers include satellite and earth station operators. The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies a business with 35 million or less in annual receipts as small.30 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that 275 firms in this industry operated for the entire year.31 Of this number, 242 firms had revenue of less than 20 While the special purpose governments category also includes local special district governments, the 2017 Census of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on population size for the special purpose governments category. Therefore, only data from independent school districts is included in the special purpose governments category. 21 This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments county, municipal, and town or township with populations of less than 50,000 36,931 and the number of special purpose governments - independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 12,040, from the 2017 Census of Governments - Organizations tbls. 5, 6, and 10. 22 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517312 Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite,httpswww.census.govnaics?input517312year2017details517312. 23 Id. 24 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517312. 25 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEEMPFIRM, NAICS Code 517312, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517312tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEEMPFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 26 Id.

All Other Telecommunications. This industry is comprised of establishments primarily engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services, such as satellite tracking, communications telemetry, and radar station operation.35 This industry also includes establishments primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems.36 Providers of Internet services e.g. dial-up ISPs or voice over Internet protocol VoIP services, via client-supplied telecommunications connections are also included in this industry.37 The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies firms with annual receipts of 35 million or less as small.38 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 1,079 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.39 Of those firms, 1,039 had revenue of less than 25 million.40 Based on this data, the Commission estimates that the majority of All Other Telecommunications firms can be considered small. 15. Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing radio and television broadcast and wireless communications equipment.41 Examples of products made by these establishments are transmitting and receiving antennas, cable television equipment, GPS equipment, pagers, cellular phones, mobile communications equipment, and radio and television studio and broadcasting equipment.42 The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies businesses httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517410tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEREVFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 32 Id.

Unmanned Aircraft Radio Equipment Manufacturers. Neither the Commission nor the SBA have developed a small business size standard specifically applicable to unmanned aircraft radio equipment manufacturers. Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing is the closest industry with a SBA small business size standard.46 The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies businesses having 1,250 employees or less as small.47 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 656 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.48 Of this number, 624 firms had fewer than 250 employees.49 In addition, the SBA provides a size standard for the Aircraft Manufacturing industry which includes the manufacture of unmanned and robotic aircraft.50 The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies businesses having 1,500 employees or less as small.51 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 254 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.52 Of this number, 227 firms had fewer than 250 employees.53 Based on these data, we conclude that a majority of manufacturers in this industry are small. 17. Unmanned Aircraft System Operators. Neither the Commission nor the SBA have developed a small business size standard specifically applicable to UAS operators. The Commission lacks data on the number of operators in the United States that could be subject to the rules therefore, it is not possible to determine the number of affected small entity operators at this time. We find, however, that the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of the Federal Aviation Administration FAA Remote ID rule is 43 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 334220. 44 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEEMPFIRM, NAICS Code 334220, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n334220tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEEMPFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 45 Id.

In this analysis, the FAA assessed the impact of the rule on small entity non-recreational UAS operators based on an analysis that the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International AUVSI performed relating to part 107 waivers.54 In the analysis, the AUVSI determined that 92 percent of the waivers were issued to entities with fewer than 100 employees. Based on this data, the FAA determined that a majority of entities operating unmanned aircraft for other than recreational purposes are small.55 Accordingly, based on the FAAs determination, we conclude that a majority of UAS operators are small entities. D. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements 18. The NPRM proposes to adopt a band plan and service rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band to enable small and other UAS operators, to access interference-protected spectrum for control-and-non- payload communications CNPC links, and seeks comment on various options. We expect the proposals and service rules upon which we seek comment in the NPRM will impose new or additional reporting or recordkeeping andor other compliance obligations on small and other UA operators for access and use of the 5030-5091 MHz band spectrum. At this time however, the Commission cannot quantify the cost of compliance and cannot determine whether small entities will have to hire professionals to comply with the rule changes that may be adopted in this proceeding. With our request for comments on the band plan and service rules, we have also requested that parties file costs analyses to assist with the Commissions assessment of the rules that are under consideration. Below we discuss proposals in the NPRM and their potential compliance requirements for small and other entities to operate in the 5030-5091 MHz band. 19. The Band Plan. The NPRM proposes to partition the 5030-5091 MHz band to accommodate both non-networked radio-line-of-sight  or Non-Networked Access NNA  use cases, which can rely on direct communication links between an operators controller and the unmanned aircraft UA, and beyond-radio-line-of-sight  or Network-Supported Service NSS  use cases, which typically depend on network infrastructure to support communications between the operator and the UA. The NPRM proposes to dedicate a minimum of 10 megahertz of spectrum for NNA operations, and seeks comment on various options for the remaining 51 megahertz of spectrum, including dedicating 40 megahertz of spectrum for network-based NSS operations by dividing the spectrum into 4 licensed blocks of 10 megahertz each, and providing 11 megahertz for temporary additional spectrum available to either NNA-based operators or NSS licensees. The NPRM further proposes to permit only CNPC in the band, to define CNPC as any UAS transmission that is sent to or from the UA component of the UAS and that supports the safety or regularity of the UAs flight. It further proposes to provide that any entity, other than those precluded by section 310 of the Communications Act, will be eligible to obtain a 5030-5091 MHz NNA station or obtain a 5030-5091 MHz NSS license, and seeks comment on similarly restricting the eligibility of entities to operate NNA stations using assignments from a DFMS. 20. Dynamic Frequency Management System. The NPRM proposes that access to the band be managed by one or more dynamic frequency management systems DFMSs. A DFMS would be a frequency coordination system that, in response to requests from registered NNA users, would determine and assign to the requesting user, through an automated non-manual process, temporary use of certain frequencies for a particular geographic area and time period tailored to the users submitted flight plan. The NPRM seeks comment on the appropriate regulatory framework to establish for a DFMS, including what requirements should be imposed on UAS operators in the band to help ensure a DFMSs ability to provide interference-free access. Among other possible requirements, the NPRM seeks comment on what information the operator should be required to provide regarding ground stations and unmanned aircraft stations, including whether an active UAS in the band should be required to submit information required by FAAs Remote ID rule, or some subset or variation of the information, and whether a UAS should be 54 See Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft, 86 Fed. Reg. 4390, 4494 Jan. 15, 2021 Remote ID Rule. 55 See id. 556 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 required to communicate to the DFMS, in real time or within a certain period of time of the relevant event, the initiation and termination of the flight or, alternatively, the initiation and termination of the operators use of the assigned frequencies. Both of these potential rules would likely have reporting implications for small and other UAS operators, if adopted. The NPRM also seeks comment on whether to require UAS operators to register with a DFMS as a pre-condition of receiving NNA assignments and to provide certain information with such registration, which could also impact recordkeeping and reporting obligations. The NPRM proposes to authorize the administrator of a DFMS to charge UAS operators reasonable fees for its provision of services, including registration and channel assignment services, and to permit parties to petition the Commission to review fees and require changes if they are found to be excessive. 21. NNA Service Rules. The NPRM proposes to adopt service rules for NNA operations, including rules for licensing and technical requirements, and seeks comment broadly on the licensing regime or mechanism to enable authorization of NNA operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band and the costs and benefits of any proposed approach. For the licensing of stations in NNA spectrum, the NPRM proposes to adopt a licensed-by-rule authorization for aircraft and ground stations in the band. For technical requirements, the NPRM proposes to adopt the technical standard RTCA DO-362A or technical requirements based on this standard, which contains Minimum Operational Performance Standards for terrestrial-based i.e., non-satellite CNPC point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links in the 5030-5091 MHz band, including power limits, emission limits, and frequency accuracy requirements. In both the licensing eligibility and technical standards requirement discussions, we inquire whether to impose certification requirements that would likely be filed with the Commission, thereby impacting reporting requirements for users of the 5030-5091 MHz band. 22. We also seek comment on whether any of the general technical requirements in subpart D of part 87 of the Commissions rules should apply to NNA equipment, and whether to adopt any other requirements on NNA equipment to facilitate a DFMSs ability to communicate with or otherwise control such equipment in the execution of the DFMSs responsibilities. In addition, the NPRM seeks comment on the potential application of the generally applicable rules in subparts B through F of part 87, including whether to require each UAS operator using an NNA assignment in the 5030-5091 MHz band to have an operator license or permit. It further seeks comment on whether the new service should be subject to rules under part 1, subpart F governing Wireless Radio Service applications and proceedings. The application andor incorporation of existing rules under part 87 or any other part of the Commissions rules would subject NNA users of the 5030-5091 MHz band to any applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements under those rules unless explicitly excluded in the final rules. 23. NSS Service Rules. The NPRM also seeks comment on service rules for NSS licenses, including rules addressing, in particular, whether to issue geographic area defined licenses for a specific term of years, with rights of renewal. More specifically, the NPRM seeks comment on rules addressing 1 the geographic area scheme for licenses, 2 the appropriate initial and subsequent license terms, 3 performance requirements, 4 license renewal framework, and 5 technical and operational requirements. 24. For the geographic area of licenses, the NPRM seeks comment on whether to adopt larger licenses areas such as Regional Economic Area Groupings, a more granular scheme such as Partial Economic Areas, or a geographic division of the country developed specifically for aviation purposes. The NPRM proposes to issue NSS licenses for an initial 15-year term, and to limit subsequent terms to 10 years. The NPRM seeks comment on the appropriate standard for license renewal, and on whether the regulatory renewal framework for commercial geographic licensees of wireless radio services under part 1 of the Commissions rules is appropriate for NSS licensees. The NPRM also seeks comment on performance requirements, such as a requirement to cover 80 percent of the population within 12 years of license grant, and 45 percent coverage of the population within six years of license grant. For compliance demonstration, the NPRM proposes to adopt a process similar to compliance rules applicable to part 27 licensees, requiring licensees to file a construction notification with the Commission within 15 days of the expiration of the applicable benchmark, including submission of electronic coverage maps accurately 557 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 depicting the boundaries of the licensed area and the boundaries of the actual areas to which the licensee provides service. For enforcement, the NPRM proposes that if a licensee fails to meet the final performance requirement, the license authorization will terminate automatically without specific Commission action, and that failure to meet the interim requirement would result in the reduction by two years of both the due date for the final performance requirement and the license term. 25. In the event that the Commission receives mutually exclusive license applications for NSS licenses, the NPRM proposes to assign these exclusive use licenses through a system of competitive bidding. Consistent with the competitive bidding procedures the Commission has used in previous auctions, the NPRM proposes to conduct any auction for geographic area licenses for spectrum in the band in conformity with the part 1, subpart Q general competitive bidding rules, subject to any modification of the part 1 rules that the Commission may adopt in the future. For small entities, the NPRM seeks comment on whether to make bidding credits available for eligible small businesses and rural service providers. 26. The NPRM also seeks comment on appropriate technical requirements for NSS licenses, and whether the technical standard RTCA DO-362A or equivalent technical parameters should also apply to NSS licenses. As an alternative to requiring NSS licensee compliance with the RTCA DO-362A standard generally, the NPRM also seeks comment on whether there are certain specific requirements of RTCA DO-362A that the Commission should minimally impose on NSS licensees to ensure compatibility with NNA operations, or for other purposes, such as the Time Division Duplex requirements of the RTCA DO-362A standard. In addition, the NPRM seeks comment on adoption of a field strength limit to prevent interference between adjacent geographic area licensees. 27. As with NNA service rules, the NPRM seeks comment on whether and to what extent the NSS service rules should incorporate or be subject to the requirements generally applicable to aviation services under subparts B through F of part 87 of the Commissions rules, either in their current form or with modifications, and whether the NSS service should be subject to rules under part 1, subpart F governing wireless radio service applications and proceedings. In particular, the NPRM seeks comment on whether to allow partitioning and disaggregation of NSS licenses as well as spectrum leasing. Likewise as mentioned earlier in the NNA service rules discussion, NSS users would be subject to any applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements under existing Commissions rules incorporated into the requirements for the 5030-5091 MHz band. The NPRM also seeks comment on whether to authorize NSS licensees, at their discretion, to provide network-supported service for UAS CNPC through either a satellite or terrestrial network, or alternatively, whether the Commission should provide that certain NSS licenses are dedicated exclusively to satellite-based service. It further seeks comment on whether to permit NSS licensees to deploy High-altitude Platform Stations HAPS. 28. Equipment Authorization. To ensure that equipment in the new band has the level of reliability and safety required of aviation equipment, the NPRM proposes to impose equipment authorization requirements similar to those under sections 87.145 and 87.147 of the Commissions rules to all equipment intended for use in the 5030-5091 MHz band. Section 87.145 requires that each transmitter must be certificated for use in the relevant service, and section 87.147 establishes a specific equipment authorization process. Section 87.147 specifically requires an applicant for certification of equipment to notify the FAA of the filing of the application, and provides that the Commission will not act on the application until it receives the FAAs determination regarding whether it objects to the application for equipment authorization. 29. Protection of Other Services. The NPRM seeks comment on any measures the Commission should adopt to protect federal Microwave Landing System MLS deployments in the 5030- 5091 MHz band, and on whether to provide that no future non-federal MLS licenses including MLS radionavigation land test licenses at 5031 MHz will be granted in the 5030-5091 MHz band. To protect radio astronomy operations, the NPRM proposes, consistent with NTIAs recommendations, to continue to apply to the 5030-5091 MHz band the requirements of Footnote US211 of the Table of Frequency Allocations, and to prohibit UAS operations within the National Radio Quiet Zone NRQZ without prior 558 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 coordination with the NRQZ administrator and submission of a concurrence from the NRQZ administrator with any request to a DFMS for frequency assignment within the NRQZ. The NPRM also seeks comment on applying to all UAS operations relying on the 5030-5091 MHz band in the NRQZ the licenseeapplicant procedures for the NRQZ under section 1.924a of the Commissions rules, which include written notification filing requirements.56 The NPRM further seeks comment on any special measures necessary to ensure compatibility between UAS operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band and AeroMACS and flight testing in adjacent bands. To protect radionavigation-satellite service in the 5010- 5030 MHz band, the NPRM proposes to require 5030-5091 MHz operations to comply with the specific effective isotropically radiated power EIRP spectral density limit specified in Footnote 5.443C of the Table of Frequency Allocations. With regard to Canadian and Mexican coordination, the NPRM proposes to provide that all operations in the band are subject to international agreements with Mexico and Canada. 30. Airborne Use of Flexible-Use Spectrum. Regarding UAS operations in flexible-use spectrum, the Commission did not make specific proposals and seeks comment on the adequacy of its current rules to ensure co-existence of existing terrestrial wireless networks and UAS, and on the regulatory solutions that may be necessary to facilitate and encourage such use. Thus, at this time the Commission is not in a position to determine what rule changes could result from the questions raised in the NPRM, and which of those changes, if any, will result in reporting andor recordkeeping obligations for small entities. 31. VHF Licenses for UAS Pilots. The NPRM proposes that the Commission individually license stations for UA pilot communication with control towers and other aircraft pilots under a new category of licensed station, an Unmanned Aircraft Operator Ground VHF Station, and to define the new station as a station on the ground providing unmanned aircraft pilot radio communication relating to safety and regularity of flight on air traffic control, flight service station, unicom, or multicom frequencies. The NPRM further proposes to provide that these stations may operate over all air traffic control, flight service station, aeronautical advisory station unicom and aeronautical multicom channels authorized for use by aircraft. In addition, the NPRM proposes to permit mobile stations stations intended to be used while in motion or during halts at unspecified points, and seeks comment on whether to permit non-mobile stations as well. Under this proposal, UAS operators would be required to file a license application with the Commission for an individual license covering their VHF station. E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and Significant Alternatives Considered 32. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business, alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives among others 1 the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities 2 the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance or reporting requirements under the rule for such small entities 3 the use of performance, rather than design standards and 4 an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities.57 33. In this proceeding, the Commission seeks comment on options to license the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS CNPC. UAS operators have a growing need for the greater reliability of interference- protected licensed spectrum for CNPC, and the licensing of the 5030-5091 MHz band has the potential to provide UAS operators with access to interference-protected communications of sufficient reliability for operations where those communications links are safety-critical. As such access will support the growth of the UAS industry and help to realize its enormous potential economic and social benefits, the Commission anticipates that adoption of licensing rules for the band will have a significant positive economic impact on small and other UAS manufacturers, operators, and other stakeholders. 56 See 47 CFR  1.924. 57 See 5 U.S.C.  603c1-4. 559 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 34. The Commission believes that applying the licensing rules equally to all entities will generally be necessary to protect the safety of life and property in air navigation and promote the efficient and intensive use of spectrum. However, to assist the Commissions evaluation of the economic impact on small entities and to better explore the alternatives in consideration of their economic impact on small entities as well as other factors, the NPRM has sought comment broadly on possible alternatives for a band plan and licensing rules, and requests information on the potential costs and benefits of such alternatives to small and other UAS operators. In addition, the NPRM has proposed or sought comment on certain specific options that may facilitate small entity access to spectrum in the band. 35. The NPRM proposes a band plan to support both NNA and NSS operations. We propose to partition the band, to dedicate different segments of spectrum in the 5030-5091 MHz band for NNA and NSS, and to license each of these segments in a manner that is appropriate to support the relevant use cases in order to accommodate both NNA and NSS users. We are also considering whether to make available spectrum for multi-purpose uses, e.g., expansion bands for temporary NNA or NSS use, and seek comment on this alternative. We seek comment on whether we should use a portion of the 51 megahertz for opportunistic use by both NNA or NSS licensees multi-purpose use or whether we should increase the amount of spectrum dedicated to NNA operations. 36. To the extent we dedicate spectrum for NSS licenses, we also seek comment on making that spectrum available for NNA operations on an interim, opportunistic basis. We seek comment on the costs and benefits of this approach, including its technical and economic feasibility, and on alternative approaches to ensuring productive usage of dedicated NSS spectrum prior to network deployment, which will help inform the Commission on the impact for small entities before adopting final rules. Further, as alternative approach to allocating spectrum in the band, we seek comment on alternative approaches to allocating the 5030-5091 MHz band for the support of UAS, including whether we should 1 allocate only a portion of the band at this time and defer allocation of the remainder of the band or 2 preserve part of the band at this time for experimental use, or for potential future satellite-based CNPC that relies on the AMSRS allocation in the band. 37. Ensuring the ability of the DFMS to provide interference-free access and promote robust and efficient use of the spectrum will most likely require the adoption of rules for NNA operators, including small operators. We seek comment on such requirements, including 1 whether to require operators to provide ground station geographic location, effective isotropically radiated power EIRP, andor antenna patterns 2 whether to require an active UAS relying on an NNA assignment in the band to provide a DFMS with the UA information that must be broadcast under the Remote ID rule or some subset or variation of the information 3 whether a UAS operator should be required to affirmatively communicate to the DFMS, in real time or within a certain period of time of the relevant event, the initiation and termination of the flight or, alternatively, the initiation and termination of the operators use of the assigned frequencies and 4 whether there are other circumstances or information aside from the request that a UAS operator should be required by rule to communicate to the DFMS. 38. Interactions between the DFMS and UAS operators involving frequency assignment may require the Commission to adopt a registration process. Rather than propose a mandatory registration requirement before frequency assignments can be requested, we seek comment from small and other UAS operators on whether such a requirement is needed, and if so, what requirements should be imposed regarding registration. We seek comment on whether the Commission should simply require registration and leave the details to be developed such as by the DFMSs or a multi-stakeholder group. We believe that allowing small UAS operators and other commenters to address this issue, including with cost data analysis, is the better approach to inform the Commission on the economic and other impacts for these operators. Similarly, regarding the submission of frequency requests, we consider what requirements, if any, should be imposed with respect to the submission of UAS operator requests for NNA frequency assignments, and alternatively what, if any, details of the request process should be left to be developed by a multi-stakeholder group. We also consider in the NPRM how to assist small and other operators if the need to revise their assignments arises after a flight has commenced by seeking comment on what, if 560 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 any rules we should adopt to enable or facilitate the filing and timely processing of requests by the DFMS for revised assignments, or to otherwise address an operators mid-flight need for revised assignment. 39. As part of the DFMS frequency coordination system, we have proposed and seek comment on allowing the DFMS administrator to charge reasonable fees for its provision of services, including registration and frequency assignment services, to UAS operators receiving the services. The Commission has taken steps to minimize the economic impact on small and other UAS operators by proposing to authorize UAS operators to petition the Commission to review DFMS fees and require changes if they are found to be unreasonable or excessive. Additionally, to encourage efficient use of the limited spectrum resource and discourage any attempt at warehousing which would likely disadvantage small UAS operators, we seek comment on specifically authorizing reasonable usage-based fees. 40. We also seek comment on potential alternatives to the DFMS proposal to enable dynamic spectrum access to the 5030-5091 MHz band, on the feasibility, costs, and benefits of alternative options as compared to the DFMS, and on whether such alternatives would be sufficiently reliable to support even the most safety-critical uses such as flights in controlled airspace. 41. The NPRM also proposes to implement licensing of NNA stations using licensed-by-rule authorization for both aircraft and ground stations in the band. Licensing by rule would reduce the burden on small entities and other UAS operators of obtaining direct access to protected spectrum for CNPC, as they would not be required to obtain individual spectrum licenses for themselves or their aircraft or ground UAS stations in order to operate in the 5030-5091 MHz band. In addressing the license rules for NSS operations, the NPRM seeks comment on issuing licenses on an exclusive geographic area basis. The NPRM also seeks comment on several options that may help to reduce the burden to small entities of obtaining and using such licenses or otherwise facilitate small entity access to this spectrum. First, while the NPRM seeks comment on defining license areas using large geographic areas such as Regional Economic Area Groupings REAGs which divide the nation into twelve regional areas, it also seeks comment on using a more granular scheme, such as Partial Economic Areas PEA, which may be more affordable or better tailored for small entities. 42. Second, the NPRM proposes certain measures to facilitate small entity participation in any competitive bidding process conducted for these licenses. Specifically, the NPRM proposes to conduct a competitive bidding process in the event that it receives mutually exclusive license applications. In order to promote and reduce the costs of participation for small service providers, the NPRM proposes to make bidding credits available for this band. A bidding credit of 15 percent for a qualifying small business, defined as an entity with average gross revenues for the preceding five years not exceeding 55 million, and a bidding credit of a 25 percent for a qualifying very small business, defined as an entity with average gross revenues for the preceding five years not exceeding 20 million have been proposed in the NPRM.58 These proposed small business definitions and bidding credits are consistent with recent competitive bidding processes used by the Commission for assignment of licenses. The NPRM also seeks comment on whether to offer rural service providers a bidding credit for licenses in this band which would provide another opportunity for small providers who would qualify as rural providers to reduce their the costs of participation. 58 The standardized schedule of bidding credits provided in section 1.2110f2i of the rules defines small businesses based on average gross revenues for the preceding three years. In December 2018, Congress revised the standard set out in the Small Business Act for categorizing a business concern as a small business concern, by changing the annual average gross receipts benchmark from a three-year period to a five-year period. Thus, as a general matter, a federal agency cannot propose to categorize a business concern as a small business concern for Small Business Act purposes unless the size of the concern is based on its annual average gross receipts over a period of not less than 5 years. 15 U.S.C.  632a2CiiII, as amended by Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-324 Dec. 17, 2018 see 13 CFR  121.903a1ii. For consistency with the statutory requirements, we therefore propose to adopt the Small Business Acts revised five-year average gross receipts benchmark for purposes of determining which entities qualify for small business bidding credits. 561 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 43. Third, the NPRM seeks comment on whether to allow partitioning and disaggregation of NSS licenses in secondary market transactions as well as spectrum leasing. Allowing these secondary market transactions could provide small entities with additional options for access to this spectrum, and may be an effective way to facilitate targeted network deployments, including by small entities. 44. In the NPRM, the Commission seeks comment on UAS operations on flexible-use spectrum using existing networks as platforms, which may offer small and other UAS operators a near term, low-cost option rather than requiring them to build-out a dedicated network for UAS operations. However, because existing terrestrial networks were not designed for UAS use, the Commissions terrestrial mobile service rules generally do not consider airborne use, and the introduction of UAS operations may result in increased interference. In light of the considerable stakeholder interest in UAS on flexible-use spectrum, and the Commissions commitment to allow flexibility in the use of existing spectrum and networks to the extent feasible, the Commission explores flexible-use as a potential option for UAS operations and seeks comment on the adequacy of its current rules to ensure co-existence of existing terrestrial wireless networks and UAS as well as on the regulatory solutions that may be necessary to facilitate and encourage such use. The Commission expects to more fully understand the feasibility of allowing UAS operations on flexible-use spectrum and the economic impact on small entities following its review of comments filed in response to the NPRM. 45. We also discuss adding a provision to part 87 of the Commissions rules to enable UAS operators to file an application with the Commission to obtain an individual VHF license under a new category of licensed station to address a need by some small and other UAS operators to communicate with ATC facilities in accordance with FAA rules. As mentioned in the prior section, in some instances the FAA requires UAS operators to communicate with ATC or with nearby manned aircraft over the VHF traffic control and advisory frequencies and to obtain a license from the Commission for this purpose. In the absence of provisions in the Commissions rules to provide such a license, the Commission handles such requests from UAS operators by granting special temporary authority on a case-by-case basis. The addition of the proposed licensing provision to part 87 will provide certainty of process and a more permanent operating authorization for small entities as compared to the special temporary authority the Commission uses for UAS operators to comply with the FAAs requirements. We anticipate that this proposal will help to facilitate the growth and safety of UAS operations by small and other entities. 46. Finally, the Commission expects to consider more fully the economic impact on small entities following its review of comments filed in response to the NPRM, including costs and benefits information and alternative proposals. The Commissions evaluation of the comments filed in this proceeding will shape the final alternatives it considers, the final conclusions it reaches, and the actions it ultimately takes in this proceeding to minimize any significant economic impact that may occur on small entities as a result of any final rules that are adopted. F. Federal Rules that May Duplicate, Overlap, or Conflict with the Proposed Rules 47. Proposed UAS service rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band would, in part, overlap with and, depending on the UAS equipment requirements established in this proceeding, may be inconsistent with the FAAs Technical Standard Order TSO C213a, which establishes minimum performance standards for UAS radios in the 5030-5091 MHz band. 562 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101 APPENDIX C List of Commenters AIA PETITION COMMENTS AND REPLIES Comments CTIA Elefante Group Integrity Communications Solutions Inc.

As Ive said before, this is an area where the United States can clearly lead with the right regulatory support. U.S. companies and research universities continue to incubate drone technologies at FAA-designated testing sites across the countryincluding in Nevada, where I previously visited a testbed to learn about the industrys vision and growing challenges. In 2021, we helped drive drone development through the establishment of FCC Innovation Zones. We followed it up by refreshing the record on a path forward for drones in the 5030-5091 MHz bandwhich is the focus of our action today. As I said back then, these systems cannot truly flourish without Commission action governing the operation of UAS in licensed spectrum, and getting there will require careful work with our federal partners. Today, after close collaboration with NTIA and the FAA, were proposing service and licensing rules to support robust, reliable, and safe UAS deployments in the 5 GHz band. Thats real progress. Of course, even as far as the Commissions role is concerned, securing a vibrant future for UAS isnt about just one frequency band. Thats why Im pleased to see us incorporate other critical issues related to drone operations into this notice of proposed rulemaking. Consistent with industry and academic interest and ongoing standards-setting efforts, were exploring 5G as a UAS platform and the broader use of cellular bands for drone applications. Were also proposing a way to license drone communications with air traffic control. UAS technologies pose plenty of potential, and their promise goes well beyond just package deliveries. They can aid disaster relief, protect critical infrastructure, enhance smart applications and precision agriculture, improve public safety, and even help us build more safely and efficiently. Were right to continue supporting their development, even as we also explore the unique policy challenges posed by their operation. I am grateful to the Commission staff who developed this item. It has my full support. 565 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 Before the Federal Communications Commission Washington, D.C. 20554 In the Matter of   Data Breach Reporting Requirements  WC Docket No. 22-21 NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING Adopted December 28, 2022 Released January 6, 2023 Comment Date 30 days after publication in the Federal Register Reply Comment Date 60 days after publication in the Federal Register By the Commission TABLE OF CONTENTS I.

The Commission first adopted a rule in 2007 requiring telecommunications carriers and interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP providers to notify customers and federal law enforcement of breaches of customer proprietary network information CPNI in the carriers possession.1 In the almost decade and a half since that time, data breaches nationwide have increased in both frequency and severity in all industries.2 In the telecommunications industry, the public has suffered an 1 See Implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 Telecommunications Carriers Use of Customer Proprietary Network Information and Other Customer Information IP-Enabled Services, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 22 FCC Rcd 6927 2007 2007 CPNI Order 47 CFR  64.2011. 2 Identity Theft Resource Center, Identity Theft Resource Center to Share Latest Data Breach Analysis With U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Number of Data Breaches in 2021 Surpasses All of 2020 Oct. 6, 2021, httpswww.idtheftcenter.orgidentity-theft-resource-center-to-share-latest-data-breach-analysis-with-u-s-senate- commerce-committee-number-of-data-breaches-in-2021-surpasses-all-of-2020 see also IAPP, U.S. State Data Breach Lists, httpsiapp.orgresourcesarticleu-s-state-data-breach-lists last visited Jan. 4, 2023 compilation of the numerous states agency-maintained databases listing breaches reported in their states. 566 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 increasing number of security breaches of customer information in recent years.3 Federal and state data breach laws covering other areas have evolved since 2007.4 Those developments combined with our specific experience suggest opportunities for improvement in our own breach notification rule. The time is ripe. Today, we begin the process to update and strengthen our data breach rule to provide greater protections to the public. II. BACKGROUND 2. Privacy of Telecommunications Customer Information. Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended the Act, requires telecommunications carriers to protect the privacy and security of information about their customers to which they have access as a result of their unique position as network operators.5 Section 222a requires carriers to protect the confidentiality of proprietary information of and relating to their customers.6 Section 222c1 provides that a carrier may only use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI that it has received by virtue of its provision of a telecommunications service 1 as required by law 2 with the customers approval or 3 in its provision of the telecommunications service from which such information is derived, or services necessary to or used in the provision of such telecommunications service.7 The Act defines CPNI as A 3 See, e.g., ATT Services, Inc., Order, 30 FCC Rcd 2808 2015 reaching 25 million settlement of investigation into three breaches Selena Larson, Verizon data of 6 million users leaked online, CNN Business July 12, 2017, httpsmoney.cnn.com20170712technologyverizon-data-leaked-onlineindex.html T-Mobile, Notice of Data Breach Keeping you safe from cybersecurity threats Sep. 7, 2021, httpswww.t-mobile.combranddata-breach- 2021 providing notice that in August 2021 T-Mobile discovered a breach that occurred in July 2021 CNET, T- Mobile hack Heres what we know about the massive data breach Aug. 28, 2021, httpswww.cnet.comtecht- mobile-hack-heres-what-we-know-about-the-massive-data-breach Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, Company that Routes Billions of Text Messages Quietly Says It Was Hacked, Motherboard Tech by Vice Oct. 4, 2021, httpswww.vice.comenarticlez3xpm8company-that-routes-billions-of-text-messages-quietly-says-it-was-hacked last visited Jan. 4, 2023 reporting that Syniverse, a telecommunications infrastructure provider for mobile service, disclosed that its databases has been breached on several occasions since 2016, impacting potentially millions of cellphone users worldwide see also TerraCom, Inc. and YourTel America, Inc.

Section 222b provides that a carrier that receives or obtains proprietary information from other carriers in order to provide a telecommunications service may only use such information for that purpose and may not use that information for its own marketing efforts. 47 U.S.C.  222b. Section 222d delineates certain exceptions to the general principle of confidentiality, including permitting a carrier to use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI obtained from its customers to protect telecommunications services users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C.  222d. Subsequent to the adoption of section 222c1, Congress added section 222f. Section 222f provides that for purposes of section 222c1, without continued. 567 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 information that relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of use of a telecommunications service subscribed to by any customer of a telecommunications carrier, and that is made available to the carrier by the customer solely by virtue of the carrier-customer relationship and B information contained in the bills pertaining to telephone exchange service or telephone toll service received by a customer of a carrier.8 The Commission has explained that CPNI includes but is not limited to information such as the phone numbers called by a consumer the frequency, duration, and timing of such calls the location of a mobile device when it is in active mode i.e., able to signal its location to nearby network facilities and any services purchased by the consumer, such as call waiting.9 3. The Commission first promulgated rules implementing section 222 in 1998.10 In addition to adopting restrictions on the use and disclosure of CPNI, the Commission adopted a set of rules designed to ensure that telecommunications carriers establish effective safeguards to protect against unauthorized use or disclosure of CPNI.11 In 2007, the Commission amended its CPNI rules to, among other things, require carriers12 to notify law enforcement and customers of security breaches involving CPNI.13 The Commission defined breach for this purpose as one that occurs when a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, has intentionally gained access to, used, or disclosed CPNI.14 The Commissions rules require a telecommunications carrier to notify law enforcement of a breach of its customers CPNI no later than seven business days after a reasonable determination of a breach by sending electronic notification through a central reporting facility to the United States Secret Service Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI.15 The rules permit a telecommunications Continued from previous page the express prior authorization of the customer, a customer shall not be considered to have approved the use or disclosure of or access to 1 call location information concerning the user of a commercial mobile service or 2 automatic crash notification information of any person other than for use in the operation of an automatic crash notification system. 47 U.S.C.  222f. 8 47 U.S.C.  222h1. 9 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6930, para. 5 see also ATT, Inc., File No. EB-TCD-18-00027704, Notice of Apparently Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment, 35 FCC Rcd 1743, 1757, paras. 33-35 2020 finding that customer location information is CPNI under the Act Implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 Telecommunications Carriers Use of Customer Proprietary Network Information and Other Customer Information, et al., CC Docket No. 96-115, Declaratory Ruling, 28 FCC Rcd 9609 2013 2013 CPNI Declaratory Ruling concluding that information collected by a customers device at the carriers direction may be CPNI 1999 CPNI Reconsideration Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 14487, paras. 146-47 adopting the conclusions of the Common Carrier Bureau that names, addresses, and telephone numbers are not CPNI. 10 See Implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 Telecommunications Carriers Use of Customer Proprietary Network Information and Other Customer Information, et al., CC Docket Nos. 96-115, et al., Second Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 13 FCC Rcd 8061 1998 1998 CPNI Order. 11 See id. at 8195, para. 193. 12 In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we refer to telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers collectively as telecommunications carriers or carriers, consistent with our existing Part 64, Subpart U rules. In doing so, we do not address the regulatory classification of interconnected VoIP service or interconnected VoIP service providers. See 47 CFR  64.2003o defining telecommunications carrier or carrier for purposes of Subpart U to include an entity that provides interconnected VoIP service as that term is defined in 47 CFR  9.3. 13 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6943-45, paras. 26-32. 14 47 CFR  64.2011e. 15 47 CFR  64.2011b. Additionally, the Commissions rules require carriers to maintain a record of any discovered breaches, notifications to the Secret Service and the FBI regarding those breaches, as well as the Secret Service and the FBI response to the notifications for a period of at least two years. This record must include, if available, the date that the carrier discovered the breach, the date that the carrier notified the Secret Service and the continued. 568 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 carrier to notify the customer andor disclose the breach publicly after seven business days following notification to the Secret Service and the FBI, if the Secret Service and the FBI have not requested that the telecommunications carrier continue to postpone disclosure.16 Under the rules, a telecommunications carrier may immediately notify a customer or disclose the breach publicly only after consultation with the relevant investigative agency and only if the carrier believes that there is an extraordinarily urgent need to notify a customer or class of customers in order to avoid immediate and irreparable harm.17 The Commission declined to specify the precise content of the notice that must be provided to customers in the event of a breach of CPNI, saying that it was leaving telecommunications carriers discretion to tailor the language and method of notification to the circumstances.18 4. In 2016, the Commission acted to revise its breach notification rule as part of a larger proceeding addressing privacy requirements for broadband internet access service providers ISPs.19 In 2017, however, Congress nullified those 2016 revisions to the Commissions CPNI rules under the Congressional Review Act.20 5. In 2013, as part of a larger proceeding addressing the video relay service VRS and telecommunications relay TRS programs, the Commission adopted rules to protect the privacy of Continued from previous page FBI, a detailed description of the CPNI that was breached, and the circumstances of the breach. See 47 CFR  64.2011d. 16 If the relevant investigating agency determines that public disclosure or notice to customers would impede or compromise an ongoing or potential criminal investigation or national security, the law enforcement agency may direct the carrier not to disclose the breach for an initial 30-day period. This 30-day period may be extended by the law enforcement agency as reasonably necessary in the judgment of the agency. The law enforcement agency shall provide in writing to the carrier its initial direction to the carrier and any subsequent direction. 47 CFR  64.2011b3. 17 See 47 CFR  64.2011b2 requiring a telecommunications carrier to indicate its desire to notify its customer or class of customers immediately in the notice that it provides to the Secret Service and FBI. 18 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6945, para. 32. 19 Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services, WC Docket No. 16- 106, Report and Order, 31 FCC Rcd 13911, 14019-33, paras. 261-291 2016 2016 Privacy Order. In 2015, the Commission classified broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service subject to Title II of the Act, a decision that the D.C. Circuit upheld in United States Telecom Assn v. FCC. See Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet, GN Docket No. 14-28, Report and Order on Remand, Declaratory Ruling, and Order, 30 FCC Rcd 5601, 5733, paras. 306 2015, affd, United States Telecom Assn v. FCC, 825 F.3d 674 D.C. Cir. 2016. As a result of classifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service, such services were subject to section 222 of the Act. The rules the Commission adopted in the 2016 Privacy Order applied to carriers and interconnected VoIP providers in addition to ISPs. See 2016 Privacy Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 13925, para. 39, 14033- 34, para. 293. In 2017, the Commission reversed the 2015 classification decision so that Title II obligations, including section 222, no longer apply to ISPs.

Data Breach Notification Laws and Regulations. As the Commission has previously explained, its data breach rule is not intended to supersede any statute, regulation, order, or interpretation in any state, except to the extent that such statute regulation, order, or interpretation is inconsistent with the provisions of the rule, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.23 In 2007, the Commission explicitly rejected requests to preempt all state CPNI obligations, finding instead that states should also be allowed to create rules for protecting CPNI.24 7. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have laws requiring covered entities to notify individuals of data breaches.25 Our breach notification requirement is one of several sector-specific breach notification laws in the United States. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act GLBA, and the Federal Trade Commission FTC-enforced Health Breach Notification Rule all have customer notification requirements for breaches of individual data.26 In addition to sector-specific breach notification rules, the FTC has brought actions under section 5a of the FTC Act raising allegations that companies acted unfairly by failing to protect consumer data, resulting in security breaches.27 The FTC has also published extensive guidance for businesses in the event of a security breach of customer information, setting forth recommendations for appropriate best practices after a data breach has 21 Structure and Practices of the Video Relay Service Program Telecommunications Relay Services and Speech-to- Speech Services for Individuals with Hearing and Speech Disabilities, CG Docket Nos. 10-51, 03-123, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 28 FCC Rcd 8618, 8680, para. 155 2013 2013 VRS Reform Order 47 CFR  64.5111. 22 2013 VRS Reform Order, 28 FCC Rcd at 8684, para 165. 23 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6945, para. 31 47 CFR 64.2011f. 24 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6957-58, para. 60 recognizing that many states have laws relating to the safeguarding of personal information such as CPNI, and to the extent those laws do not create a conflict with federal requirements, carriers are able to comply with both federal and state law. 25 See National Conference of State Legislatures, Security Breach Notification Laws Jan. 17, 2022, httpswww.ncsl.orgresearchtelecommunications-and-information-technologysecurity-breach-notification- laws.aspx with links to notification laws of each state, district, and territory. 26 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub.

Recent Developments. The Commission adopted the data breach rule, like the rest of the privacy safeguards adopted in the 2007 CPNI Order, to address the problem of pretexting, the practice of pretending to be a particular customer or other authorized person in order to obtain access to that customers call detail or other private communications records.29 In the almost 15 years since, it has become clear that breaches of customer information in many contexts extend far beyond pretexting in general or the specific type of pretexting addressed at that time and are increasing in scale and evolving in methodology. For example in 2015, ATT reached a settlement with the Commission to resolve an investigation into three data breaches at call centers in Mexico, Columbia, and the Philippines perpetrated by insiders who sold customer information to criminals that resulted in the compromise of the personal information of almost 52,000 customers.30 In 2017, Verizon confirmed the leak of the personal data of six million customers, caused by a misconfigured security configuration on a cloud server.31 And in 2021, T-Mobile disclosed that the personal information of over 50 million customers was stolen by hackers.32 Verizon also recently disclosed a breach of its subsidiary Visible.33 And Syniverse, which provides interconnection services to wireless carriers, disclosed that that an unknown individual or organization gained unauthorized access to databases within its network on several occasions, potentially compromising the security of text messages of millions of wireless customers in a series of breaches spanning years.34 These examples demonstrate the increasing severity and diversifying methods of security breaches involving customer information, which can have lasting detrimental impacts on customers whose information has been breached.35 9. To help protect consumers from the ever-growing harms of breaches of personal information across sectors, Congress and the states have taken action. For example, in 2009, Congress enacted laws that created breach notification requirements for businesses that maintain health care information, resulting in HIPAAs breach notification rules and the FTCs Health Breach Notification 28 FTC, Data Breach Response A Guide for Business at 6 2021, httpswww.ftc.govsystemfilesdocumentsplain-language560a_data_breach_response_guide_for_business.pdf FTC Data Breach Guidance. 29 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6928, paras. 1-2  n.1. 30 ATT Services, Inc., Order, 30 FCC Rcd 2808 2015. 31 See Selena Larson, Verizon data of 6 million users leaked online, CNN Business July 12, 2017, httpsmoney.cnn.com20170712technologyverizon-data-leaked-onlineindex.html last visited Jan. 4, 2023. 32 T-Mobile, Notice of Data Breach Keeping you safe from cybersecurity threats Sep. 7, 2021, httpswww.t- mobile.combranddata-breach-2021 providing notice that in August 2021 T-Mobile discovered a breach that occurred in July 2021 CNET, T-Mobile hack Heres what we know about the massive data breach Aug. 28, 2021, httpswww.cnet.comtecht-mobile-hack-heres-what-we-know-about-the-massive-data-breach. 33 Scott Ikeda, Attack on Verizon Visible Confirmed To Be a Credential Stuffing Campaign Hacked Accounts Charged for Thousands of Dollars in Purchases, CPO Magazine Oct. 21, 2021, httpswww.cpomagazine.comcyber-securityattack-on-verizon-visible-confirmed-to-be-a-credential-stuffing- campaign-hacked-accounts-charged-for-thousands-of-dollars-in-purchases reporting that Visible recently experienced an attack that saw customer accounts taken over and orders placed using stored payment information. 34 See Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, Company that Routes Billions of Text Messages Quietly Says It Was Hacked, Motherboard Tech by Vice Oct. 4, 2021, httpswww.vice.comenarticlez3xpm8company-that-routes-billions- of-text-messages-quietly-says-it-was-hacked last visited Jan. 4, 2023. 35 See, e.g., RAND Corporation, Consumer Attitudes Toward Data Breach Notifications at xii 2016, httpswww.rand.orgcontentdamrandpubsresearch_reportsRR1100RR1187RAND_RR1187.pdf finding that 68 of data breach victims reported an estimated financial loss, with a median loss of 500 Identity Theft Resource Center, 2021 Identity Crimes Aftermath Report How Identity Crimes Impact Victims, Their Families, Friends and Workplaces at 16-20 2021, httpswww.idtheftcenter.orgidentity-theft-aftermath-study finding that 32 of identity theft victims reported identity-related financial problems, among other consequences. 571 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 Rule.36 In 2010, Congress passed laws imposing breach notification requirements on financial institutions through amendments to GLBA.37 At the state level, California has been an active leader in consumer privacy laws,38 most recently in 2019 with the California Consumer Protection Act CCPA39 and the passage of the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA in 2020.40 Elsewhere, in 2021, Virginia and Colorado became the second and third states respectively to enact comprehensive consumer privacy laws,41 while every state and territory now has some form of breach notification requirements.42 Both Californias and Virginias recent privacy laws drew inspiration from the 2016 passage of the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which created one of the worlds most comprehensive privacy regimes.43 III. DISCUSSION 10. To better protect telecommunications customers and ensure that our rules keep pace with todays challenges, we propose a number of updates to our rule addressing telecommunications carriers breach notification duties. We seek to ensure that affected customers, the Commission, and other federal law enforcement agencies receive the information they need in a timely manner so they can mitigate and prevent harm due to the breach and take action to deter future breaches.44 To identify best practices and to minimize burdens, we look to other federal and state breach laws as potential models for our rules. 11. We propose to expand the Commissions definition of breach to include inadvertent disclosures of customer information and seek comment on adopting a harm-based trigger for breach notifications. We also propose to require carriers to notify the Commission, in addition to the Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach. We also propose to eliminate the 36 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Pub. L. No. 111-5, 123 Stat. 258  13400-13402 2009.

L 119 1-88 EC text of GDPR. 44 See 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6943, para. 27 Notifying law enforcement of CPNI breaches is consistent with the goal of protecting CPNI because law enforcement can investigate the breach, which could result in legal action against the perpetrators, thus ensuring that they do not continue to breach CPNI . . . and this should enable law enforcement to advise industry, the Commission, and perhaps Congress regarding additional measures that might prevent future breaches.. 572 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 mandatory waiting period before notifying customers and instead require carriers to notify customers of CPNI breaches without unreasonable delay after discovery of a breach unless requested by law enforcement. We also seek comment on whether we should adopt minimum requirements for the content of customer breach notices. We also evaluate and seek comment on the impact of the Congressional disapproval of the 2016 Privacy Order on the Commissions legal authority to issue the rules proposed herein for telecommunications carriers. Finally, we propose to make changes to our TRS data breach reporting rule consistent with those we propose to our CPNI breach reporting rule. A. Defining Breach 12. Inadvertent Disclosures. We propose to expand the Commissions definition of breach to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosures of customer information and seek comment on our proposal. Our current rule, adopted in response to the practice of pretexting,45 defines a breach as when a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, has intentionally gained access to, used, or disclosed CPNI.46 While the practice of pretexting necessarily involves an intent to gain access to customer information, the intervening years since the adoption of our existing rule have demonstrated that the inadvertent exposure of customer information can result in the loss and misuse of sensitive information by scammers and phishers, and trigger a need to inform the affected individuals so that they can take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their information.47 Further, whether or not a breach was intentional may not always be immediately apparent, which may lead to legal ambiguity and under- reporting. We also believe that it is important that the Commission and law enforcement be made aware of any accidental access, use, or disclosures so that we can 1 investigate and advise carriers on how best to avoid future breaches, and 2 stand ready to investigate if and when any of the affected information falls prey to malicious actors.48 We anticipate that requiring notification for accidental breaches will encourage telecommunications carriers to adopt stronger data security practices and will help us identify and confront systemic network vulnerabilities. Do commenters agree with the foregoing analysis? Are 45 See supra para. Error!

What are the benefits and burdens associated with this proposal? We note that state data breach laws overwhelmingly do not include an intent limitation,49 and we seek comment on how state and other federal data breach laws should influence the policy we adopt. 13. We seek comment on the impact of requiring reporting of accidental breaches on the number of reported breaches. Do commenters foresee a significant increase in the number of reported breaches? If so, how would our proposal affect reporting costs for telecommunications carriers and is that burden outweighed by the benefits to customers, who may need to take actions to protect their personal and financial information whether or not the breach was intentional? Would removing the intentionality limit potentially risk over-notification of data breaches to customers? What would the impacts of over- notification be? Would the potential benefits outweigh any potential harm? To help us assess the burden to both carriers and consumers from requiring reporting of accidental breaches, we invite commenters to provide estimates on the total number of breaches they have detected over the past few years, as well as the number of people affected by those breaches, and the severity of the compromised CPNI. 14. We propose to revise our definition to define a breach as any instance in which a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, has gained access to, used, or disclosed CPNI. We seek comment on this proposal and other possible definitions. Should we retain the intent limitation in certain contexts? If so, what contexts and why? With only a few exceptions, the vast majority of state statutes include a provision exempting from the definition of breach a good-faith acquisition of covered data by an employee or agent of the company where such information is not used improperly or further disclosed.50 49 See, e.g., Ala.

Stat.  40-12-501ai. 574 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 Should we include such an exemption in our definition of breach or is such a provision unnecessary or otherwise inadvisable? Is our proposed rule sufficient to capture all instances in which persons, either purposefully or inadvertently, gain access to, use, or disclose CPNI? If not, how should we revise our proposed rule to ensure that it does? We also seek comment on whether we should expand the definition of a breach to include situations where a telecommunications carrier or a third party discovers conduct that could have reasonably led to exposure of customer CPNI, even if it has not yet determined if such exposure occurred.51 15. Harm-Based Notification Trigger. We seek comment on whether to forego requiring notification to customers or law enforcement of a breach in those instances where a telecommunications carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. Our current rule requires no showing of harm, instead requiring that notification be furnished in every instance where a breach of a carriers customers CPNI has occurred, where such breach is defined as any instance when a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, has intentionally gained access to, used, or disclosed CPNI.52 16. We seek comment on the benefits and drawbacks of adopting a harm-based notification trigger. How would it impact consumers? Would it benefit consumers by avoiding confusion and notice fatigue with respect to breaches that are unlikely to cause harm? Recognizing that it is not only distressing, but time consuming and expensive, to deal with the fallout of a data breach, we seek comment on whether a harm-based notification trigger could save consumers the time, effort, and financial difficulty of changing their passwords, purchasing fraud alerts or credit monitoring, and freezing their credit in the wake of a breach that is not reasonably likely to result in harm. Alternatively, does a harm- based notification trigger risk that consumers would be unaware of important information regarding their CPNI? We note that a harm-based trigger has a basis in data breach notification frameworks employed by states, which generally do not require covered entities to notify customers of breaches when a determination is made that the breach is unlikely to cause harm.53 How should state and other data breach laws influence our analysis? 17. We also seek comment on the potential impacts of adopting a harm-based trigger on telecommunications carriers. Would a harm-based trigger allow carriers to better focus their resources on data security and ameliorating the harms caused by data breaches? Or to the contrary, would a harm- 51 For example, in 2017 Verizon notified the public that an employee of one of its vendors had put information in cloud storage with settings that could have allowed it to be exposed to the public even though it did not result in a loss or theft of Verizon or Verizon customer information because the issue was remedied before any public exposure occurred.

If we adopt a harm-based trigger, how should telecommunications carriers and the Commission determine the likelihood of misuse or harm? Should we identify a standard or set of factors that telecommunications carriers must consider to evaluate whether no harm to customers is reasonably likely?54 If so, what factors should carriers consider in making their evaluation? We preliminarily believe that no single factor on its own e.g., basic encryption is sufficient to make a determination regarding harm to customers. Do commenters agree? Do carriers have sufficient expertise and experience to determine whether a breach is likely to result in harm? Should we establish a rebuttable presumption of consumer harm unless and until a carrier demonstrates that no harm to consumers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of a breach?55 19. We seek comment on whether we should clarify the definition of misuse or harm.56 For example, should we construe harm broadly to encompass not only financial, but also physical and emotional harm, including reputational damage, personal embarrassment, and loss of control over the exposure of intimate personal details? Should we require telecommunications carriers to consider whether other information about the customers that may be available combined with CPNI could result in harm when determining whether notification is required? Should any harm-based trigger apply even where the data breached is encrypted? What are the potential enforcement and compliance implications associated with this approach? Should breaches without such harm be reported to the Commission even if not reported to customers? Should we require the carrier to consult with federal law enforcement andor the Commission prior to determining that there is no reasonable likelihood of harm or misuse?57 We seek comment on whether there are other triggers we should consider for which notice would be unnecessary, such as the number of affected consumers or the length of time exposure occurred. Are there other factors that we should consider before requiring breach notifications? Should we adopt a harm-based trigger only if we require notices of unintentional breaches, or should we evaluate the two issues independently? We also seek comment on the current notification practices in the industry. How do carriers currently make decisions regarding whether to notify customers and law enforcement of a breach? 20. We seek comment on whether any harm-based notification trigger should apply to both 54 See, e.g., OMB M-17-12 at 20-27 setting forth a list of factors that agencies should consider when assessing the risk of harm to potentially affected individuals resulting from a breach 45 CFR  164.4022 setting forth a list of four factors that covered entities must consider when determining whether an acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information demonstrates a sufficiently high probability of harm so as to constitute a breach and trigger the notification requirements under HIPAA. 55 See 45 CFR  164.4022 establishing a rebuttable presumption of a breach that triggers the notification requirements under HIPAA except where covered entities demonstrate that there is a low probability that the protected health information in question has been compromised based on a risk assessment of four listed factors, including i The nature and extent of the protected health information involved, including the types of identifiers and the likelihood of re-identification ii The unauthorized person who sued the protected health information or to whom the disclosure was made iii Whether the protected health information was actually acquired or viewed and iv The extent to which the risk to the protected health information has been mitigated. 56 See Rules and Regulations Implementing the Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009, Report and Order, 26 FCC Rcd 9114, 9122, para. 22 2011 agreeing that the term harm is a broad concept that encompasses financial, physical, and emotional harm see also Adrian Abramovich, Marketing Strategy Leaders, Inc., and Marketing Leader, Inc., File No. EB-TCD-15-00020488, NALAcct.

Stat. 501.1714c. 576 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 notifications to customers and notifications to law enforcement. While there are legitimate reasons to consider eliminating notifications to customers in those instances where a breach is not reasonably likely to result in harmincluding reducing confusion, stress, financial hardship, and notice fatiguecan the same be said of notifications to law enforcement? Are there compelling reasons for carriers to continue notifying law enforcement of data breaches even where such breaches are not reasonably likely to result in consumer harm? Do the benefits of notifying law enforcement of all breaches, regardless of whether the breach is likely to result in harm, outweigh the attendant costs to carriers of providing such notice? 21. We propose that if we adopt a harm-based trigger, where a carrier is unable to make a determination regarding harm or is uncertain whether harm is likely to occur, the obligation to notify would remain. We seek comment on this proposal. 22. We also recognize that telecommunications carriers possess proprietary information other than CPNI that customers have an interest in protecting from public exposure, such as Social Security Numbers and financial records. We seek comment on the Commissions authority to establish breach- reporting obligations for this type of information under Section 222, to the extent that this information is obtained by a telecommunications carrier in its activity as a common carrier.58 We also seek comment on the role of the Commission in protecting such information in light of the existing role of other agencies, including the FTC and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA.59 If we were to require telecommunications carriers to report breaches of proprietary information other than CPNI under Section 222a, how broadly or narrowly should we define that category of information? If we were to extend our data breach rule to cover such information, how could we minimize duplicative reporting obligations from the FTC and CISA? B. Notifying the Commission and other Federal Law Enforcement of Data Breaches 23. Commission Notification. We propose to require telecommunications carriers to notify the Commission of breaches, in addition to the Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable, and seek comment on our proposal. Our proposal is consistent with other federal sector-specific laws, which require prompt notification to the relevant subject-matter agency. For example, both HIPAA and the Health Breach Notification Rule require notice to the department of Health and Human Services HHS and the FTC respectively.60 We seek comment on the benefits and costs of requiring notification to the Commission in addition to notifying the Secret Service and the FBI, as our existing rules require.61 24. As discussed above, the Commission adopted its existing data breach rule to address concerns regarding pretexting practices.62 The Commission found that notifying law enforcement of CPNI breaches is consistent with the goal of protecting CPNI because it enables law enforcement to investigate the breach, which could result in legal action against the perpetrators, thus ensuring that they do not continue to breach CPNI.63 Moreover, the Commission anticipated that law enforcement investigations into how breaches occurred would enable law enforcement to advise the carrier and the Commission to take steps to prevent future breaches of that kind.64 However, as we have seen in the 58 15 U.S.C.  45a prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, but exempting common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce, 44 defining Acts to regulate commerce as including the Communications Act of 1934 and all Acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto. 59 See infra para. 26 discussing CISA duplication. 60 45 CFR  164.408 A covered entity shall, following the discovery of a breach . . . notify the Secretary 16 CFR  318.3a2. 61 47 CFR  64.2011b2. 62 See supra para. Error! Reference source not found.. 63 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6943, para. 27. 64 See id. 577 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 years since our data breach rule was initially adopted, not all breaches of customer data are the result of criminal pretexting, which was Commissions sole focus in 2007. Large-scale security breaches can also be the result of lax or inadequate data security practices and employee training. Thus, we tentatively conclude that notification of breaches will provide Commission staff important information about data security vulnerabilities that Commission staff can help address and remediate. We anticipate that breach notification to the Commission will also shed light on carriers ongoing compliance with our rules. We seek comment on these tentative conclusions. How much of an incremental burden is associated with notifying the Commission of data breaches as compared to the existing data breach notification requirement for the Secret Service and FBI? Are there any other government entities to which we should require data breach reporting, such as the FTC? What would be the benefits and burdens of doing so? 25. Method of Notification. We propose that the Commission create and maintain a centralized portal for reporting breaches to the Commission and other federal law enforcement agencies, and we seek comment on our proposal. Our current breach notification rule requires that telecommunications carriers notify the FBI and Secret Service through a central reporting facility to which the Commission maintains a link on its website.65 We believe that the creation and operation by the Commission of a centralized reporting facility for reporting of breaches to the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI will streamline the notification process and improve federal coordination. Do commenters agree? Are there alternative mechanisms for breach reporting to the Commission and other federal law enforcement that we should consider instead, such as leveraging the existing central reporting facility? Are there existing notification resources that we can leverage? For example, could we leverage the CISA Incident Reporting System66 to minimize burdens on carriers? 26. We seek comment on how we can minimize data breach reporting burdens for telecommunications carriers. The recently-passed Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 CIRCIA requires covered entities to notify CISA of cyber security incidents and establishes an interagency Cyber Incident Reporting Council intended to streamline interagency cyber incident reporting.67 When implemented, CIRCIA will require covered entities to report cybersecurity incidents to CISA, except where covered entities by law, regulation, or contract are already required to report substantially similar information to another Federal agency within a substantially similar timeframe,68 in which case the other agency will report the incident to CISA.69 To the extent that a breach of CPNI is a result of a cyber incident, we seek comment on whether there are any modifications to our proposed rules that would minimize potential duplicate reporting of such breaches. 27. Contents. We seek comment on applying our existing requirements regarding the contents of the data breach notification to federal law enforcement agencies to breaches reported to the Commission. Generally, the central reporting facility requires carriers to report information relevant to the breach, including carrier contact information a description of the breach incident the method of 65 47 CFR  64.2011b. See Federal Communications Commission, CPNI Breach Reporting Facility, httpswww.fcc.govgeneralcpni-breach-reporting-facility last visited Jan. 4, 2023. 66 Cybersecurity  Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA Incident Reporting System, httpsus- cert.cisa.govformsreport last visited Jan. 4, 2023. The CISA Incident Reporting System allows Federal Government departments and agencies, and other entities, to report breaches of federal government information and information systems.

The federal agency must establish an interagency sharing agreement and mechanism with CISA for this exception. 578 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 compromise the date range of the incident, approximate number of customers affected an estimate of financial loss to the carriers and customers, if any types of data breached and the addresses of affected customers. We believe that the information currently submitted through the FBISecret Service reporting facility is largely sufficient, and that generally the same information should be reported under the rule we propose here. Do commenters agree? Are there any additional or alternative categories of information that should be included in these disclosures? For example, should we require telecommunications carriers to report, at a minimum, the information required under CIRCIA with the aim of minimizing potentially duplicate reporting requirements?70 Should we curtail or streamline any of the existing content requirements? For example, should we eliminate the requirement that carriers report the addresses of affected individuals to law enforcement and the Commission, to minimize the personal information reported to the Commission and law enforcement? 28. Timeframe. We seek comment on the appropriate timeframe for notifying the Commission and other federal law enforcement of a breach. Our current rule requires telecommunications carriers to notify the Secret Service and the FBI of all breaches of CPNI no later than seven business days after reasonable determination of the breach.71 We propose to require carriers to notify the Commission of a reportable breach contemporaneously with notification to other law enforcement agencies as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach. We believe that requiring carriers to notify the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI at the same time will minimize burdens on carriers, eliminate confusion regarding obligations, and streamline the reporting process, allowing carriers to free up resources that can be used to address the breach and prevent further harm. We seek comment on our proposal. Is as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach an appropriate timeframe for notifying law enforcement after reasonable determination of a CPNI breach? Or, should we maintain the current no later than seven business days standard? Is there an alternative timeframe we should adopt for reporting CPNI breaches to the Commission and other federal law enforcement such as 24 hours or 72 hours as has been proposed in other contexts,72 or should we consider adopting a graduated timeframe?73 We also seek comment on whether we should clarify when a carrier should be treated as having reasonably determined that a breach has occurred. Should a carrier be held to have reasonably determined a breach has occurred when it has information indicating that it is more likely than not that there was a breach? Should we publish guidance on what constitutes a reasonable determination? Should we adopt a more definite standard? 29. Threshold Trigger. We seek comment on whether it is appropriate to set a threshold for the number of customers affected to require a breach report to the Commission, Secret Service, andor FBI. We observe that breaches affecting smaller numbers of customers may not necessitate the same law enforcement attention as larger breaches because they may be less likely to reflect coordinated attacks on CPNI. Under our current rule, telecommunications carriers must notify federal law enforcement of all 70 See CIRCIA, sec. 2242b4 requiring, at a minimum, a description of the covered cyber incident a description of the vulnerabilities exploited and security defense that were in place, as well as the techniques used to perpetrate the covered incident any identifying information related to those reasonably believed to be responsible for the incident the categories of information reasonably believed to have been accessed or acquired by unauthorized persons and contact information of the covered entity impacted. 71 47 CFR  64.2011a-b. 72 CIRCIA requires covered entities to notify CISA no later than 72 hours after the entity reasonably believes that a covered cybersecurity incident has occurred, and to report ransomware payments within 24 hours. See CIRCIA, sec. 2242a1A 2242a2. The GDPR requires notification of a personal data breach to the relevant government authority within 72 hours of discovery of the breach. Council Directive 2016679, art. 33, 2016 O.J. L 119 1 EC. 73 See, e.g., Executive Order 14028 mandating updates to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that will require, among other things, federal contractors to report cyber incidents based on a graduated scale of severity, with reporting on the most severe cyber incidents not to exceed 3 days after initial detection. 579 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 reportable breaches, regardless of the number of customers affected. Setting a threshold for the number of customers affected for breach reporting to the Secret Service and FBI could reduce the administrative burdens on carriers and law enforcement agencies from excessive reporting, and is consistent with many state statutes requiring notice to state law enforcement authorities, which require law enforcement notification of large breaches. 30. At the same time, establishing a threshold may limit our and our federal partners abilities to remediate, investigate, and deter smaller breaches. Further, as the Commission has previously found, notification of all breaches could allow the Commission and federal law enforcement to be better positioned than individual carriers to develop expertise about the methods and motives associated with CPNI breaches.74 Is this still the case, given the development of data breach law and practices since 2007? Should we adopt a threshold for reporting to federal law enforcement? If so, should the threshold be the same for the Commission as for federal law enforcement? If not, how should the threshold differ? What would be an appropriate threshold for reporting? Most states that adopt a threshold for reporting to law enforcement or government agencies require reporting at 250,75 500,76 or 100077 individuals affected. What reporting threshold would meet the needs of law enforcement and provide adequate safeguards? What are the benefits and drawbacks of setting a threshold, particularly for small carriers? If we adopt a threshold trigger, should we require carriers to maintain a record of smaller breaches that fall below the threshold and report such small breaches to the Commission in a report at the end of the year?78 What are the benefits and drawbacks to such an approach? Rather than a numerical threshold, should we instead consider requiring carriers to report only intentional breaches to law enforcement, but to report all breaches, whether intentional or inadvertent, to the Commission? C. Customer Notification 31. Notifying Customers of Data Breaches without Unreasonable Delay. We propose to require telecommunications carriers to notify customers of CPNI breaches without unreasonable delay after discovery of a breach and notification to law enforcement, unless law enforcement requests a delay. We seek comment on our proposal. Our existing data breach rule prohibits telecommunications carriers from notifying customers or disclosing the breach to the public until at least seven full business days after 74 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6943, para. 27. 75 See, e.g., N.D. Cent. Code  51-30-02 requiring entities to report data breaches affecting 250 residents or more to the state Attorney General Or. Rev. Stat.  646A.6041b same S.D. Codified Laws  20-40-20 same. 76 See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code  1798.82f requiring entities to report data breaches affecting 500 residents or more to the state Attorney General Colo. Rev.

Admin. Code  8-38-6a requiring entities to report data breaches affecting 1000 residents or more to the state Attorney General Ariz. Rev. Stat.

We tentatively conclude that this existing approach is out-of-step with current approaches regarding the urgency of notifying victims about breaches of their personal information. We tentatively conclude that our proposal better serves the public interest than our current rule because it increases the speed at which customers may receive the important information contained in a notice, except in those specific circumstances when law enforcement officials specifically request otherwise.83 We seek comment on our tentative conclusion. What are the benefits and drawbacks to such an approach? Is there any reason to maintain our current absolute bar to customer notification for a set period? Does our proposal to eliminate the seven business-day waiting period before notifying customers appropriately balance legitimate law enforcement needs with the customers need to take action to timely protect their information after a breach? We seek comment on whether a without unreasonable delay notification requirement would allow carriers enough time to determine the scope and impact of a breach. Would prompt customer notification compromise a carriers ability to discover the source of the breach, mitigate the loss of data, and ensure further data is not compromised? 33. Our proposed requirement is consistent with many existing data breach notification laws that require expedited notice but refrain from requiring a specific timeframe. For example, the GLBA requires customer notification as soon as possible after a determination that customer information has been misused.84 California law requires notification be made in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement.85 Similarly, many state data breach statutes impose an expeditiously as practicable or without unreasonable delay standard instead of a set time limit for reporting.86 In addition, FTC guidance on addressing data breaches explains that if you quickly notify people that their personal information has been compromised, they can take steps to reduce the chance that their information will be misused.87 How should state and other federal law influence the approach we adopt? 79 47 CFR  64.2011b1. 80 47 CFR  64.2011b2. 81 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6943-44, para. 28. 82 Id. at 6944, para. 28. 83 Cf., e.g., R.I. Gen. Laws  11-49.3-4a2 requiring notification to state Attorney General and major credit reporting agencies if more than 500 residents are affected by a breach, specifying that such notice should be made without delaying notice to affected residents, and permitting law enforcement to delay notification if necessary for investigation. 84 12 CFR pt. 364, Appx.

We seek comment on whether requiring notice to customers without unreasonable delay after discovery of a breach provides sufficient guidance as to the required timeframe to notify customers. Should we adopt a different approach, such as a fixed number of days for notification, and if so what should we adopt? If we were to adopt a without unreasonable delay standard, we seek comment on whether we should provide guidance on a specific time period that would be considered reasonable for notification. For example, HIPAA requires notification to individuals without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of a breach.88 The Health Breach Notification Rule also requires notification to individuals without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 days after the discovery of a breach of security.89 Most states that impose an outside limit on when consumers must be notified of a breach require notification to affected consumers no later than 30,90 45,91 or 6092 days after discovery of a breach. What are the benefits and drawbacks to setting a definite time limit on notification while requiring notification without unreasonable delay? 35. We also seek comment on whether the same notification deadline should be applied to all carriers. Are there unique concerns or compliance barriers for small carriers that make prompt response unfeasible, such as resource availability or reliance on third-party cybersecurity services for breach detection? Should we adopt different notification requirements for small carriers? If so, what threshold should we establish for small carriers? Should we consider establishing any other exceptions to this proposed requirement? We also seek comment on whether we should take into consideration the scope of the breach, e.g., how many customers are affected, the type of information breach, in determining the appropriate timeframe for customer breach reporting. 36. We seek comment on how best to coordinate the timing of customer notification and federal law enforcement notification. Our current rule, providing for consecutive rather than simultaneous notification of federal law enforcement and customers, was adopted at the request of federal law enforcement.93 Is such an approach still necessary? Are there circumstances where it would be acceptable for carriers to notify customers and law enforcement simultaneously in certain instances? Given that nearly all, if not all, state data breach statutes subject the timing of customer notification to legitimate law enforcement needs,94 we seek comment on whether it is necessary to provide any further guidance to help coordinate the timing of notice to customers with notice to the Commission and other federal law enforcement. 37. In addition, consistent with our current rules implementing section 222, our proposed rules would allow a federal agency to direct a carrier to delay customer notification for an initial period of up to 30 days if such notification would interfere with a criminal investigation or national security.95 In 88 45 CFR  164.404b. For breaches involving more than 500 individuals, HIPAA also requires notification of prominent media outlets serving the state or jurisdiction without unreasonable delay and no later than 60 days. 45 CFR  164.406. For breaches involving more than 500 individuals HIPAA also requires notification to the Secretary of Health and Human Services HSS. 45 CFR  164.408. 89 16 CFR  318.4a. 90 See, e.g., Colo. Rev.

Code  19.255.0103. 582 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 circumstances when a carrier reasonably decides to consult with law enforcement, a short delay pending such consultation would likely be reasonable for purposes of a without unreasonable delay standard for customer notification. We seek comment on this proposal. We observe that HIPAA, the GLBA, and the Health Breach Notification Rules allow for a delay of customer notification if law enforcement determines notification to customers would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national security, but only if law enforcement officials request such a delay.96 Both HIPAA and the Health Breach Notification Rule allow notification delays of up to 30 days if requested by law enforcement.97 Similarly, GLBA allows that customer notice may be delayed if an appropriate law enforcement agency determines that notification will interfere with a criminal investigation and provides the institution with a written request for a delay.98 Likewise, most, if not all, states permit delays in notifying affected consumers for legitimate law enforcement needs.99 We tentatively conclude that our proposal strikes an appropriate balance between the needs of law enforcement to have time to investigate criminal activity and the needs of customers to be notified of data breaches. Do commenters agree? We also observe that these other regimes appear to allow non-federal law enforcement to request a delay, whereas the Commissions rule currently allows only federal agencies to so request.100 Should our rule also allow carriers to delay notification upon request of non-federal law enforcement? 38. Contents of Customer Breach Notification. We seek comment on whether we should require customer breach notifications to include specific minimum categories of information. Our current rules specify when and to whom breach notifications must be made, but do not address the content of such notifications.101 In adopting the current breach notification rules, the Commission declined to specify the precise content of the notice that must be provided to customers in the event of a security breach of CPNI, leaving carriers the discretion to tailor the language and method of notification to the circumstances.102 Nearly 15 years later, we now seek comment on whether it is appropriate to require a minimum amount of information to ensure that such data breach notifications contain actionable information that is useful to the consumer. We seek comment on the benefits to customers and carriers of requiring carriers to include minimum categories of information in customer data breach notices. Will having minimum consistent fields of information assist consumers in understanding the circumstances and nature of the breach and streamline notice practices for carriers? What are the drawbacks to doing so? Are there any legal barriers to adopting a rule that prescribes the minimum categories of information in these breach notices? 39. To so identify possible categories of information to require, we look to numerous state Continued from previous page 95 See 47 CFR  64.2011b3. 96 See 16 CFR  318.4c 12 CFR part 364, Appx.

Zamorski, Director, Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection, Financial Institution Letters, FIL-27-2005 Apr. 1, 2005, httpswww.fdic.govnewsfinancial-institution-letters2005fil2705.html GLBA Customer Notice Guidance. 584 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 Breach Response Guide, the FTC advises companies on specific information that should be included in their breach notices to individuals, including describing what the company knows about the breach how it happened, what information was taken, how the thieves have used the information if known, what actions the company has taken to remedy the situation, what actions the company is taking to protect individuals, how to reach the relevant contact in the organization the steps individuals can take, given the type of information exposed, and provide relevant contact information current information about how to recover from identity theft information about the law enforcement agency working on the case, if the law enforcement agency agrees that would help encouraging people who discover that their information has been misused to report it to the FTC and describing how the company will contact consumers in the future to help victims avoid phishing scams.113 40. We seek comment on adapting these models to telecommunications carriers and requiring carriers to include, at a minimum, the following information in security breach notices to customers 1 the date of the breach 2 a description of the customer information that was used, disclosed, or accessed 3 information on how customers, including customers with disabilities, can contact the carrier to inquire about the breach 4 information about how to contact the Commission, FTC, and any state regulatory agencies relevant to the customer and the service 5 if the breach creates a risk of identity theft, information about national credit reporting agencies and the steps customers can take to guard against identity theft, including any credit monitoring, credit reporting, or credit freezes the carrier is offering to affected customers and 6 what other steps customers should take to mitigate their risk based on the specific categories of information exposed in the breach. Are the identified categories the correct information to be included in data breach notices? Should we consider requiring any additional or alternative categories of information that carriers must include in customer breach notices? For example, would it be helpful to include a statement of whether the notification was delayed due to reporting requirements to law enforcement or a law enforcement investigation, and if so, the length of the delay to help explain to customers the time lapse between discovery of the breach and customer notification?114 Should we require notifications to include a list of the law enforcement and government entities that have been notified of the breach? Should we require carriers to include a brief description of how the carrier will contact consumers in the future regarding the breach to help consumers avoid phishing scams related to breaches? What are best practices for providing consumers with actionable information in a breach notification? We seek comment on what minimum required information appropriately balances empowering consumers to take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their information in the wake of a data breach and appropriately limiting burdens on telecommunications carriers. We also seek comment on whether adopting or adapting a set of existing notification contents requirements will help to create a measure of consistency across breach notifications and will benefit both consumers and carriers, particularly smaller carriers, by streamlining the manner and content of their response in the event of a data breach. 41. Method of Customer Breach Notification. We observe that many state regulations specify the form that notifications to customers may take, whether by physical mail, email, or telephone.115 We seek comment on whether we should adopt a similar requirement and, if so, on what form notifications to consumers should take. Is there a method or methods of notification that would make the most sense or be most beneficial to consumers? What are the benefits and burdens of imposing such a requirement? 113 See Data Breach Response A Guide For Business, Federal Trade Commission Feb. 2021, httpswww.ftc.govtips-advicebusiness-centerguidancedata-breach-response-guide-business. 114 See Cal.

Code  19.255.0104. 585 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 D. TRS Breach Reporting 42. In 2013, the Commission adopted CPNI rules applicable to all forms of Telecommunications Relay Services TRS, as well as to point-to-point video calls handled over the video relay services VRS network.116 The Commission found that for TRS to be functionally equivalent to voice telephone services, consumers with disabilities who use TRS are entitled to have the same assurances of privacy as do consumers without disabilities for voice telephone services.117 The CPNI rules for TRS include a breach notification rule that is equivalent to section 64.2011 in terms of the substantive protection provided to TRS users.118 To maintain functional equivalency for TRS users, we propose to amend section 64.5111 so that it continues to provide equivalent privacy protection for TRS users. The amendments we propose for section 64.5111 are thus essentially the same as those proposed for users of telecommunications and interconnected VoIP services. That is, we propose 1 to expand the Commissions definition of breach to include inadvertent disclosures of customer information 2 to require TRS providers to notify the Commission, in addition to the Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach and 3 to eliminate the mandatory waiting period to notify customers, instead requiring TRS providers to notify customers of CPNI breaches without unreasonable delay after discovery of a breach unless law enforcement requests a delay. Further, we seek comment on the following additional issues, raised above regarding section 64.2011, as they relate to TRS providers 1 whether to adopt a harm-based trigger for breach notifications 2 whether we should adopt minimum requirements for the content of customer breach notices and 3 whether our rules should address breaches of sensitive personal information. 43. We seek comment on each of these proposals and their costs and benefits. Should updated data breach requirements for TRS providers be identical to those we adopt for providers of telecommunications and interconnected VoIP services, or are there circumstances unique to TRS providers that warrant differences in their obligations regarding data breaches? Are any additional notification requirements necessary to ensure TRS users receive functionally equivalent privacy protection? If we adopt the proposed requirement that service providers notify the Commission of breaches via a centralized portal, is there any need to retain the current requirement that TRS providers submit a copy of any breach notification to the Disability Rights Office of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau?119 Finally, would TRS providers incur costs or other compliance burdens under the proposed amendments that are disproportionately greater than those incurred by providers of telecommunications and interconnected VoIP services, and if so, would the extent of such costs or burdens justify the application of different breach notification requirements to TRS? 44. Legal Authority. Section 225 of the Act directs the Commission to ensure that TRS are available to enable communication in a manner that is functionally equivalent to voice telephone services.120 In 2013, the Commission found that applying the privacy protections of the Commissions 116 Structure and Practices of the Video Relay Service Program Telecommunications Relay Services and Speech-to- Speech Services for Individuals with Hearing and Speech Disabilities, CG Docket Nos. 10-51 and 03-123, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 28 FCC Rcd 8618, 8680-87, para. 155-172 2013 2013 VRS Reform Order 47 CFR  64.5101-64.5111 TRS CPNI rules. This includes the breach notification rule. See 47 CFR  64.5111. 117 2013 VRS Reform Order, 28 FCC Rcd at 8683, para. 164 118 The texts of the two provisions are virtually identical, except for the substitution of the term TRS provider for telecommunications carrier in section 64.5111. Compare 47 CFR  64.2011 with 47 CFR  64.5111. The only substantive difference is that under the TRS rule, after a TRS provider notifies law enforcement of a breach, it shall file a copy of the notification with the Disability Rights Office of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau at the same time as when the TRS provider notifies the customers. 47 CFR  64.5111a. 119 See 47 CFR  64.5111a. 120 47 U.S.C.  225a3, b1. 586 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 CPNI regulations to TRS users advances the functional equivalency of TRS.121 The Commission concluded further that the specific mandate of section 225 to establish functional requirements, guidelines, and operations procedures for TRS authorizes the Commission to make the privacy protections of the Commissions CPNI regulations applicable to TRS users.122 In addition, the Commission found that extending the CPNI regulations to TRS users is ancillary to its responsibilities under section 222 of the Act to telecommunications service subscribers that place calls to or receive calls from TRS users, because TRS call records include call detail information concerning all calling and called parties.123 Finally, the Commission determined that applying CPNI requirements to point-to-point video services provided by VRS providers124 is ancillary to its responsibilities under sections 222 and 225.125 45. We tentatively conclude that, for the same reasons cited in the 2013 VRS Reform Order, these sources of authority for establishing the current CPNI rules for TRS authorize the Commission to amend those rules to ensure that TRS users receive privacy protections equivalent to those proposed for users of telecommunications and VoIP services. We seek comment on this tentative conclusion. E. Legal Authority 46. Section 222. We believe that section 222 provides authority to adopt the breach notification rules for which we seek comment in this Notice.126 We also tentatively conclude that we have authority to apply the rules proposed in this Notice to interconnected VoIP providers. We seek comment on these tentative conclusions. 47. Section 222 of the Act governs telecommunications carriers in their use, disclosure, and protection of proprietary information that they obtain in the course of providing telecommunications services. Section 222a imposes a duty on carriers to protect the confidentiality of proprietary information of, and relating to customers, fellow carriers, and equipment manufacturers.127 Section 222c imposes more specific requirements on carriers as to the protection and confidentiality of CPNI.128 We tentatively conclude that both subsections provide us authority to adopt rules requiring telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers to address breaches of CPNI. 48. The Commission has long required carriers to report data breaches as part of their duty to protect the confidentiality of customers information.129 We believe that the proposed revisions to the Commissions data breach reporting rule reinforce carriers duty to protect the confidentiality of their customers information. Data breach reporting requirements also reinforce our other rules addressing the protection of CPNI.130 For example, data breach notifications can meaningfully inform customer decisions regarding whether to give, withhold, or retract their approval to use or disclose their information. Similarly, we believe that requiring carriers to notify the Commission in the event of a data breach will better enable the Commission to identify and confront systemic network vulnerabilities and 121 2013 VRS Reform Order, 26 FCC Rcd at 8685-86, para. 170. 122 Id. at para. 170  n.430, citing 47 U.S.C.  225d1A. 123 2013 VRS Reform Order, 26 FCC Rcd at 8685-86, para. 170. 124 Such point-to-point services, while provided in association with VRS, are not themselves a form of TRS. 125 2013 VRS Reform Order, 26 FCC Rcd at 8686-87, para.171. 126 We discuss legal authority for non-CPNI sensitive personal information above at supra para. 22 and for TRS breach reporting above at supra para. 43. 127 47 U.S.C.  222a. 128 See 47 U.S.C.  222c. 129 See 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6943-45, paras. 26-32. 130 See 47 CFR  64.2001-2010. 587 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 help investigate and advise carriers on how best to avoid future breaches, also helping carriers to fulfill their duty under section 222a to protect the confidentiality of their customers information. We seek comment on this analysis. 49. Interconnected VoIP. We believe that we have authority under section 222 and our ancillary jurisdiction to apply the rules we propose today to interconnected VoIP providers. In 2007, the Commission exercised ancillary jurisdiction to extend its Part 64 CPNI rules to interconnected VoIP services.131 Since then, interconnected VoIP providers have operated under these rules. Interconnected VoIP services remain within the Commissions subject matter jurisdiction and we believe that the application of customer privacy requirements to these services is reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of our statutory responsibility under section 222.132 As the Commission explained in 2007, American consumers can reasonably expect that their telephone calls are private irrespective of whether the call is made using the service of a wireline carrier, a wireless carrier, or an interconnected VoIP provider.133 Now, as then, extending section 222s protections to interconnected VoIP service customers is also necessary to protect the privacy of wireline or wireless customers that place calls to or receive calls from interconnected VoIP providers.134 In addition, in 2008, Congress ratified the Commissions decision to apply section 222s requirements to interconnected VoIP services by adding language to section 222 that expressly covers IP-enabled voice service,135 defined expressly to incorporate the Commissions definition of interconnected VoIP service.136 The 2008 revisions to section 222 would not make sense if the privacy-related duties of subsections a and c did not apply to interconnected VoIP providers. We seek comment on this analysis. 50. We seek comment on whether there are other bases of authority on which we can rely to adopt the rules we propose and seek comment on today. F. Impact of the Congressional Disapproval of the 2016 Privacy Order 51. As noted above, in 2016, the Commission acted to revise its breach notification rule as part of a larger proceeding addressing privacy requirements for broadband internet access service providers ISPs.137 The rules the Commission adopted in the 2016 Privacy Order applied to telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers in addition to ISPs, which had been 131 See 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6954-57, paras. 54-59 see also 47 CFR  64.2003o defining telecommunications carrier or carrier for purposes of the CPNI rules to include interconnected VoIP providers. 132 See 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6955, para. 55 see also United States v.

In 2015, the Commission classified broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service subject to Title II of the Act, a decision that the D.C. Circuit upheld in United States Telecom Assn v. FCC. See Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet, GN Docket No. 14-28, Report and Order on Remand, Declaratory Ruling, and Order, 30 FCC Rcd 5601, 5733, paras. 306 2015, affd, United States Telecom Assn v. FCC, 825 F.3d 674 D.C. Cir. 2016. As a result of classifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service, such services were subject to section 222 of the Act. 588 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 classified as providers of telecommunications services in 2015.138 In 2017, however, Congress nullified those 2016 revisions to the Commissions CPNI rules under the Congressional Review Act.139 52. As a threshold matter, we seek comment on the effect of the Congressional disapproval of the 2016 Privacy Order under the Congressional Review Act.140 While we seek comment on a range of proposals in this item, we clarify that, in light of the Congressional resolution of disapproval, we are not seeking comment on reissuing . . . in substantially the same form, or on issuing a new rule that is substantially the same as, the rule disapproved by Congress.141 More generally, though, we seek comment here on the effect and scope of the Congressional disapproval of the 2016 Privacy Order for purposes of adopting rules that apply to telecommunications carriers. G. Digital Equity Considerations 53. The Commission, as part of its continuing effort to advance digital equity for all,142 including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality, invites comment on any equity-related considerations143 and benefits if any that may be associated with the proposals and issues discussed herein. Specifically, we seek comment on how our proposals may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. 138 See 2016 Privacy Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 13925, para. 39, 14033-34, para. 293. In 2017, the Commission reversed the 2015 classification decision so that Title II obligations, including section 222, no longer apply to ISPs.

As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended RFA, 1 the Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFA of the possible significant economic impact on small entities by the policies and rules proposed in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Notice. The Commission requests written public comments on this IRFA. Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for comments provided on the first page of the Notice. The Commission will send a copy of the Notice, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration SBA.2 In addition, the Notice and IRFA or summaries thereof will be published in the Federal Register. 3 A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules 2. The Commission first adopted a rule in 2007 requiring telecommunications carriers and interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP providers to notify customers and federal law enforcement of breaches of customer proprietary network information CPNI in the carriers possession.4 In the almost decade and a half since that time, data breaches nationwide have increased in both frequency and severity in all industries. In the telecommunications industry, the public has suffered an increasing number of security breaches of customer information in recent years. Federal and state data breach laws covering other areas have evolved since 2007. Those developments combined with our specific experience suggest opportunities for improvement in our own breach notification rule. Today, we begin the process to update and strengthen our data breach rule to provide greater protections to the public. 3. The Commission adopted the data breach rule, like the rest of the privacy safeguards adopted in the 2007 CPNI Order, to address the problem of pretexting, the practice of pretending to be a particular customer or other authorized person in order to obtain access to that customers call detail or other private communications records.5 In the almost 15 years since, it has become clear that breaches of customer information in many contexts extend far beyond pretexting in general or the specific type of pretexting addressed at that time and are increasing in scale and evolving in methodology. The increasing severity and diversifying methods of security breaches involving customer information can have lasting detrimental impacts on customers whose information has been breached. 4. To better protect telecommunications customers and ensure that our rules keep pace with todays challenges, we propose a number of updates to our rule addressing telecommunications carriers breach notification duties. We seek to ensure that affected customers, the Commission, and other federal law enforcement agencies receive the information they need in a timely manner so they can mitigate and prevent harm due to the breach and take action to deter future breaches. To identify best practices and to minimize burdens, we look to other federal and state breach laws as potential models for our rules. 5. In this Notice, we propose to expand the Commissions definition of breach to include inadvertent disclosures of customer information and seek comment on adopting a harm-based trigger for 1 See 5 U.S.C.  603. The RFA, see 5 U.S.C.  601-612, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 SBREFA, Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 1996. 2 See 5 U.S.C.  603a. 3 See 5 U.S.C.  603a. 4 See Implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 Telecommunications Carriers Use of Customer Proprietary Network Information and Other Customer Information IP-Enabled Services, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 22 FCC Rcd 6927 2007 2007 CPNI Order 47 CFR  64.2011. 5 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6928, paras. 1-2  n.1. 594 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 breach notifications. We also propose to require carriers to notify the Commission, in addition to the Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach. We also propose to eliminate the mandatory waiting period before notifying customers and instead require carriers to notify customers of CPNI breaches without unreasonable delay after discovery of a breach unless law enforcement requests a delay. We also seek comment on whether we should adopt minimum requirements for the content of customer breach notices, and we seek comment on whether our rules should address breaches of other types of sensitive personal information beyond CPNI. Finally, we propose to make changes to our TRS data breach reporting rule consistent with those we propose to our CPNI breach reporting rule. B. Legal Basis 6. The legal basis for any action that may be taken pursuant to this Notice is contained in sections 1, 4i, 4j, 201, 202, 222, 225, 303r, and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  151, 154, 201, 202, 222, 225, 303r, 332. C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed Rules Will Apply 7. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules and by the rule revisions on which the Notice seeks comment, if adopted.6 The RFA generally defines the term small entity as having the same meaning as the terms small business, small organization, and small governmental jurisdiction.7 In addition, the term small business has the same meaning as the term small-business concern under the Small Business Act.8 A small-business concern is one which 1 is independently owned and operated 2 is not dominant in its field of operation and 3 satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.9 8. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions. Our actions, over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present. We therefore describe here, at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.10 First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, according to data from the Small Business Administrations SBA Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.11 These types of small businesses represent 99.9 percent of all businesses in the United States, which translates to 32.5 million businesses.12 9. Next, the type of small entity described as a small organization is generally any not- for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.13 The 6 See 5 U.S.C.  603b3. 7 See 5 U.S.C.  6016. 8 5 U.S.C.  6013 incorporating by reference the definition of small-business concern in the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C.  632. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  6013, the statutory definition of a small business applies unless an agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definitions in the Federal Register. 9 See 15 U.S.C.  632. 10 See 5 U.S.C.  6013-6. 11 See SBA, Office of Advocacy, Frequently Asked Questions, What is a small business, httpscdn.advocacy.sba.govwp-contentuploads20211103093005Small-Business-FAQ-2021.pdf Nov 2021. 12 Id. 13 5 U.S.C.  6014. 595 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 Internal Revenue Service IRS uses a revenue benchmark of 50,000 or less to delineate its annual electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.14 Nationwide, for tax year 2018, there were approximately 571,709 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of 50,000 or less according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.15 10. Finally, the small entity described as a small governmental jurisdiction is defined generally as governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.16 U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census of Governments17 indicate that there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.18 Of this number there were 36,931 general purpose governments county,19 municipal and town or township20 with populations of less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments - independent school districts21 with enrollment 14 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C  6015 that is used to define a small governmental jurisdiction. Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small organizations in this small entity description. See IRS, Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt Organizations  Form 990-N e-Postcard, Who May File Form 990-N to Satisfy Their Annual Reporting Requirement, httpswww.irs.govcharities-non-profitsannual-electronic-filing-requirement-for-small-exempt- organizations-form-990-n-e-postcard last visited Aug. 2, 2021. We note that the IRS data does not provide information on whether a small exempt organization is independently owned and operated or dominant in its field. 15 See Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract EO BMF, CSV Files by Region, httpswww.irs.govcharities-non-profitsexempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf. The IRS Exempt Organization Business Master File EO BMF Extract provides information on all registered tax- exemptnon-profit organizations. The data utilized for purposes of this description was extracted from the IRS EO BMF data for Region 1-Northeast Area 76,886, Region 2-Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes Areas 221,121, and Region 3-Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast Areas 273,702 which includes the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii.

Wireline Carriers 11. Wired Telecommunications Carriers. The U.S. Census Bureau defines this industry as establishments primarily engaged in operating andor providing access to transmission facilities and infrastructure that they own andor lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using wired communications networks.24 Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a combination of technologies. Establishments in this industry use the wired telecommunications network facilities that they operate to provide a variety of services, such as wired telephony services, including VoIP services, wired cable audio and video programming distribution, and wired broadband internet services.25 By exception, establishments providing satellite television distribution services using facilities and infrastructure that they operate are included in this industry.26 Wired Telecommunications Carriers are also referred to as wireline carriers or fixed local service providers.27 12. The SBA small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers classifies firms having 1,500 or fewer employees as small.28 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 3,054 firms that operated in this industry for the entire year.29 Of this number, 2,964 firms operated with fewer than 250 employees.30 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 5,183 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of fixed local services.31 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 4,737 22 While the special purpose governments category also includes local special district governments, the 2017 Census of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on population size for the special purpose governments category. Therefore, only data from independent school districts is included in the special purpose governments category. 23 This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments county, municipal and town or township with populations of less than 50,000 36,931 and the number of special purpose governments - independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 12,040, from the 2017 Census of Governments - Organizations Tables 5, 6, and 10. 24 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517311 Wired Telecommunications Carriers, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517311year2017details517311. 25 Id. 26 Id. 27 Fixed Local Service Providers include the following types of providers Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ILECs, Competitive Access Providers CAPs and Competitive Local Exchange Carriers CLECs, CableCoax CLECs, Interconnected VOIP Providers, Non-Interconnected VOIP Providers, Shared-Tenant Service Providers, Audio Bridge Service Providers, and Other Local Service Providers. Local Resellers fall into another U.S. Census Bureau industry group and therefore data for these providers is not included in this industry. 28 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517311as of 10122, NAICS Code 517111. 29 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Selected Sectors Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEEMPFIRM, NAICS Code 517311, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517311tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEEMPFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 30 Id.

Local Exchange Carriers LECs. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a size standard for small businesses specifically applicable to local exchange services. Providers of these services include both incumbent and competitive local exchange service providers. Wired Telecommunications Carriers33 is the closest industry with an SBA small business size standard.34 Wired Telecommunications Carriers are also referred to as wireline carriers or fixed local service providers.35 The SBA small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers classifies firms having 1,500 or fewer employees as small.36 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 3,054 firms that operated in this industry for the entire year.37 Of this number, 2,964 firms operated with fewer than 250 employees.38 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 5,183 providers that reported they were fixed local exchange service providers.39 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 4,737 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.40 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities. 14. Incumbent LECs. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a small business size standard specifically for incumbent local exchange services.

Competitive Local Exchange Carriers Competitive LECs. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a size standard for small businesses specifically applicable to local exchange services. Providers of these services include several types of competitive local exchange service providers.48 Wired Telecommunications Carriers49 is the closest industry with a SBA small business size standard. The SBA small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers classifies firms having 1,500 or fewer employees as small.50 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 3,054 firms that operated in this industry for the entire year.51 Of this number, 2,964 firms operated with fewer than 250 employees.52 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 3,956 providers that reported they were competitive local exchange service providers.53 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 3,808 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.54 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities. 16.

Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 131 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.60 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, the Commission estimates that the majority of providers in this industry can be considered small entities. 17. Cable System Operators Telecom Act Standard. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended the Act, also contains a size standard for small cable system operators, which is a cable operator that, directly or through an affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than one percent of all subscribers in the United States and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed 250,000,000.61 For purposes of the Telecom Act Standard, the Commission determined that a cable system operator that serves fewer than 677,000 subscribers, either directly or through affiliates, will meet the definition of a small cable operator based on the cable subscriber count established in a 2001 Public Notice.62 Based on industry data, only six cable system operators have more than 677,000 subscribers.63 Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the majority of cable system operators are small under this size standard. We note however, that the Commission neither requests nor collects information on whether cable system operators are affiliated with entities whose gross annual revenues exceed 250 million.64 Therefore, we are unable at this time to estimate with greater precision the number of cable system operators that would qualify as small cable Continued from previous page 56 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517311as of 10122, NAICS Code 517111. 57 Id. 58 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Selected Sectors Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEEMPFIRM, NAICS Code 517311, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517311tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEEMPFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 59 Id.

In this Public Notice, the Commission determined that there were approximately 67.7 million cable subscribers in the United States at that time using the most reliable source publicly available. Id. We recognize that the number of cable subscribers changed since then and that the Commission has recently estimated the number of cable subscribers to traditional and telco cable operators to be approximately 58.1 million. See Communications Marketplace Report, GN Docket No. 20-60, 2020 Communications Marketplace Report, 36 FCC Rcd 2945, 3049, para. 156 2020 2020 Communications Marketplace Report. However, because the Commission has not issued a public notice subsequent to the 2001 Subscriber Count PN, the Commission still relies on the subscriber count threshold established by the 2001 Subscriber Count PN for purposes of this rule.

See 47 CFR  76.910b. 600 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 operators under the definition in the Communications Act. 18. Other Toll Carriers. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a size standard for small businesses specifically applicable to other toll carriers. This category includes toll carriers that do not fall within the categories of interexchange carriers, operator service providers, prepaid calling card providers, satellite service carriers, or toll resellers. Wired Telecommunications Carriers65 is the closest industry with a SBA small business size standard.66 The SBA small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers classifies firms having 1,500 or fewer employees as small.67 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 3,054 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.68 Of this number, 2,964 firms operated with fewer than 250 employees.69 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 115 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of other toll services.70 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 113 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.71 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities. 2. Wireless Carriers 19. Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite. This industry comprises establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide communications via the airwaves.72 Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and wireless video services.73 The SBA size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.74 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.75 Of that number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 employees.76 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, 65 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517311 Wired Telecommunications Carriers, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517311year2017details517311. 66 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517311as of 10122, NAICS Code 517111. 67 Id. 68 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Selected Sectors Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEEMPFIRM, NAICS Code 517311, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517311tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEEMPFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 69 Id.

The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of firms that meet the SBA size standard. 601 Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102 as of December 31, 2020, there were 797 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of wireless services.77 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 715 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.78 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities. 20. Satellite Telecommunications. This category comprises firms primarily engaged in providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or reselling satellite telecommunications.79 Satellite telecommunications service providers include satellite and earth station operators. The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies a business with 38.5 million or less in annual receipts as small.80 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that 275 firms in this industry operated for the entire year.81 Of this number, 242 firms had revenue of less than 25 million.82 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 71 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of satellite telecommunications services.83 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that approximately 48 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.84 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, a little more than of these providers can be considered small entities. 3. Resellers 21. Local Resellers. Neither the Commission nor the SBA have developed a small business size standard specifically for Local Resellers. Telecommunications Resellers is the closest industry with a SBA small business size standard.85 The Telecommunications Resellers industry comprises establishments engaged in purchasing access and network capacity from owners and operators of telecommunications networks and reselling wired and wireless telecommunications services except satellite to businesses and households.86 Establishments in this industry resell telecommunications they do not operate transmission facilities and infrastructure.87 Mobile virtual network operators MVNOs are 77 Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Universal Service Monitoring Report at 26, Table 1.12 2021, httpsdocs.fcc.govpubId.licattachmentsDOC-379181A1.pdf. 78 Id. 79 US Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definitions, 517410 Satellite Telecommunications httpswww.census.govcgi-binsssdnaicsnaicsrch?input517410search2017NAICSSearchsearch2017. 80 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517410. 81 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Selected Sectors Sales, Value of Shipments, or Revenue Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEREVFIRM, NAICS Code 517410, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517410tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEREVFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 82 Id.

D. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements for Small Entities 25. In this Notice, we propose to expand the Commissions definition of breach to include inadvertent disclosures of customer information and seek comment on adopting a harm-based trigger for breach notifications. We also propose to require carriers to notify the Commission, in addition to the Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach. We also propose to eliminate the mandatory waiting period before notifying customers and instead require carriers to notify customers of CPNI breaches without unreasonable delay after discovery of a breach unless law enforcement requests a delay. We also seek comment on whether we should adopt minimum requirements for the content of customer breach notices, and we seek comment on whether our rules should address breaches of other types of sensitive personal information beyond CPNI. Finally, we propose to make changes to our TRS data breach reporting rule consistent with those we propose to our CPNI breach reporting rule. 26. Should the Commission decide to modify existing rules or adopt new rules to strengthen our data breach reporting rule, such action could potentially result in increased, reduced, or otherwise modified recordkeeping, reporting, or other compliance requirements for affected providers of service. We seek comment on the effect of any proposals on small entities. Entities, especially small businesses, are encouraged to quantify the costs and benefits of any reporting, recordkeeping, or compliance requirement that may be established in this proceeding. E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and Significant Alternatives Considered 27. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives among others 1 the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities 2 the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rules for such small entities 3 the use of performance rather than design standards and 4 an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities. 116 28. The Notice seeks comment on the particular impacts that the proposed rules may have on small entities. Specifically, the Notice seeks comment on whether there are unique concerns or compliance barriers for small carriers that make notice to customers without unreasonable delay unfeasible117 if there should be different notification requirements for small carriers118 if streamlining 113 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517919 as of 10122, NAICS Code 517810. 114 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Selected Sectors Sales, Value of Shipments, or Revenue Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEREVFIRM, NAICS Code 517919, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517919tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEREVFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 115 Id.

Our mobile phones are in our palms, pockets, and purses. We rarely go anywhere without them. There is good reason for thisthe convenience and safety of being able to reach out anytime and virtually anywhere is powerful. But this always-on connectivity means that our carriers have access to a treasure trove of data about who we are, where we have traveled, and who we have talked to. It is vitally important that this deeply personal data does not fall into the wrong hands. That is why the Federal Communications Commission has long had rules that require carriers to protect the privacy and security of data, under Section 222 of the Communications Act. But the rules this agency has on the books that require carriers to notify consumers and law enforcement of data breaches under Section 222 are more than 15 years old. That is why we kick off a proceeding to modernize our data breach rules here. We propose to eliminate the outdated seven business day mandatory waiting period before notifying customers, require the reporting of inadvertent but harmful data breaches, and ensure that the agency is notified of major data breaches. We also seek comment on how our breach reporting obligations can work alongside those forthcoming from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act. I look forward to the record that developsand updating our policies under the law. 607 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1 Before the Federal Communications Commission Washington, D.C. 20554 In the Matter of   Establishment of the Space Bureau and  MD Docket No. 23-12 the Office of International Affairs and  Reorganization of the Consumer and  Governmental Affairs Bureau and the Office   of the Managing Director   ORDER Adopted January 4, 2023 Released January 9, 2023 By the Commission I. INTRODUCTION 1. In this Order, the Federal Communications Commission the Commission or FCC takes action to modernize and streamline its operations by making changes to its International Bureau as well as certain parts of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau CGB and Office of Managing Director OMD. In this Order, we amend the Commissions rules to reflect these new organizational structures and describe the functions being realigned. We find it appropriate to make these organizational changes to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commissions activities and operations. In addition, we make other non-substantive rule revisions to reflect changes in Commission procedures and to modernize certain references to the Chairperson of the FCC. 2. First, to better support United States leadership in the emerging space economy, to promote long-term technical capacity within the FCC to address non-federal satellite programs and policies, and to improve coordination with other agencies on issues related to space, we conclude that the proper dispatch of our business and the public interest will be served by reorganizing the International Bureau into 1 a Space Bureau to handle policy and licensing matters related to satellite communications and other in-space activities under the Commissions jurisdiction and 2 an Office of International Affairs to handle issues involving foreign and international regulatory authorities as well as international telecommunications and submarine cable licensing. We find these organizational changes will provide the FCC with the updated structure it needs to provide essential international leadership in the ever- evolving global telecommunications marketplace. 3. In addition, to improve the efficiency of the agencys operations, bolster the Commissions records and document management systems, and enhance public access to critical public records, the Commission has concluded that the proper dispatch of its business and the public interest will be served by taking the following actions a. Transfer the Reference Information Center RIC from CGB to the Office of the Secretary in OMD b. Merge the records management program in OMDs Performance Evaluation and Records Management PERM group with OMDs Information Technology IT group c. Rename PERM to be the Performance and Program Management PPM group in OMD and d. Transfer the Enterprise Acquisition Center EAC in the Front Office of OMD to a new 608 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1 stand-alone group in OMD. II. DISCUSSION A. Establishment of Space Bureau and Office of International Affairs and Elimination of International Bureau 4. Under this reorganization, the Space Bureau will promote a competitive and innovative global telecommunications marketplace via space services. The Space Bureau will do so by undertaking policy analysis and rulemakings as well as authorizing satellite systems for the purpose of facilitating the deployment of satellite services, streamlining regulatory processes and maximizing flexibility for operators to meet customer needs, and fostering the efficient use of spectrum and orbital resources. The Space Bureau will also serve as a focal point for coordination with other U.S. government agencies on matters of space policy and governance, and will support the Office of International Affairs for meetings with other countries, international organizations and foreign government officials that involve space policy matters. 5. The Office of International Affairs will develop international telecommunications policy to facilitate competition in the provision of international services and further U.S. strategic objectives in global telecommunications policy. The Office of International Affairs will be responsible for policy development and licensing for international telecommunications facilities and services, submarine cables, and advising and making recommendations to the Commission on foreign ownership issues. The Office of International Affairs will also have responsibility for all intergovernmental leadership, negotiation, and representational functions. The Office of International Affairs will oversee and coordinate the FCCs global participation in international organizations and multilateral conferences, regional organizations, cross-border negotiations, and international standard setting efforts. The Office of International Affairs will also oversee bilateral meetings with other countries and foreign government officials. 6. To further these objectives and functions, the Space Bureau and the Office of International Affairs will utilize professional staff from within the Commissions current International Bureau as well as other parts of the Commission as needed. 7. To accomplish this organizational change, the following actions are taken.  The Commission will eliminate the International Bureau and generally reallocate the International Bureaus authorities and functions between the Space Bureau and Office of International Affairs.  The Space Bureau will consist of three divisions the Satellite Programs and Policy Division, the Satellite Licensing Division, and the Earth Station Licensing Division. These new divisions will have responsibilities and authorities for the analysis and functions currently housed within the Satellite Division of the International Bureau, including its branches, the Policy Branch, the Engineering Branch, and the System Analysis Branch.  The Office of International Affairs will consist of the Global Strategy and Negotiation Division and the Telecommunications and Analysis Division. The Global Strategy and Negotiation Division will be moved to the Office of International Affairs from the International Bureau as currently organized, including each of its existing Branches and will maintain its current responsibilities and authorities.1 Similarly, the Telecommunications and Analysis Division will be moved to the Office of International Affairs from the International Bureau as currently organized and will maintain its current responsibilities and authorities. 1 The branches of the International Bureau Global Strategy and Negotiation Division include the International Radiocommunication Branch, the Cross Border Negotiations and Treaty Compliance Branch, and the Multilateral and Regional Affairs Branch. 609 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1  The International Bureaus front office staff, including management and administrative staff within the front office, will be reassigned to the Space Bureau or the Office of International Affairs depending upon their roles and responsibilities. 8. Furthermore, to implement these changes, we delegate the authority to the Space Bureau and the Office of International Affairs to make any necessary edits and updates to the Commissions rules and any forms, policies, web addresses, systems, or other documents associated with the International Bureau to ensure all relevant references and procedures are updated consistent with the provisions of this Order, including any changes needed for renaming the International Bureau Filing System IBFS to the International Communications Filing System ICFS. Any previous delegation to the International Bureau also is transferred to the Satellite Bureau andor the Office of International Affairs, as appropriate.2 B. Reorganization of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau and the Office of Managing Director 9. The key objectives of this reorganization are to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the Commissions operations and management of prominent public-facing functions as well as vital internal information management operations. 1. Transfer the Reference Information Center to the Office of the Secretary 10. The RIC serves as the FCC custodian for designated public records, with functions including intake of records, file maintenance, reference services, retrieval of records, and retirement or archiving of files in accordance with record retention schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Administration NARA. The RIC is also currently responsible for managing the Commissions Electronic Comment Filing System ECFS and scanning and uploading documents filed on paper into ECFS as needed. 11. Section 0.11 of the Commissions Rules instructs OMD to direct agency efforts to improve management effectiveness, operational efficiency, employee productivity, and service to the public.3 Pursuant to Section 0.11b, the Secretary of the Commission is designated the official custodian of the Commissions documents.4 The Office of the Secretary in OMD oversees prompt and orderly processing of all matters presented to the Commission and supports the Commission decision- making process to ensure efficient operations. To preserve the integrity of the Commissions records, the Office of the Secretary supervises the receipt and distribution of documents filed by the public through electronic and paper filing systems. In addition, the Office of the Secretary gives effective legal notice of Commission decisions by publishing them in the Federal Register and the FCC Record. The Secretary serves as legal custodian of the Commissions official records and publishes official documents to the agencys website. 12. After this reorganization, the Office of the Secretary will be responsible for the management of ECFS in addition to the document custodial functions it performs today. Since the Office of the Secretary currently manages both electronic documents EDOCS and the Electronic Commissions Lifecycle Agenda Tracking System ECLAS, the addition of ECFS to its list of responsibilities will create further efficiencies in the management and planning of these important internal and public facing systems. 13. In addition to giving it responsibility over ECFS, we transfer administration and management of the RIC from CGB to the Office of the Secretary. By taking this action, we locate the 2 See e.g., Use of Spectrum Bands Above 24 GHz, Report and Order and FNPRM, 31 FCC Rcd 8014 2016 Mandatory Electronic Filing of Section 325c Applications, International Broadcast Applications, and Dominant Carrier Section 63.10c Quarterly Reports, Order, 36 FCC Rcd 12038 2021. 3 47 CFR  0.11. 4 Id. 610 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1 Commissions public records reference functions with the internal organization that currently carries out other reference functions, including management of the FCC Library. 14. We also update the Commissions rules to reflect the revised procedures for the public to access the RIC. Due to the updated security protocols associated with the FCCs new headquarters, all visitors to the RIC will be required to have a scheduled appointment in advance of accessing the facility. 2. Transfer of Records Management from PERM to IT 15. In OMD, the PERM group has responsibility for the administration and implementation of the FCCs agency-wide records management program, as opposed to the RIC which oversees an important subset of publicly available FCC records. PERMs records management program develops policies, procedures and processes to facilitate retrieval, selection, retention, and disposition of record and non-record materials and coordinates the records management program throughout the FCC and with NARA. The FCCs Agency Records Officer in PERM is responsible for complying with and updating the records schedules set by NARA. 16. As discussed at the outset of this Order, with our actions today, we merge and relocate the records management program and functions into OMDs IT group. The IT group is currently responsible for providing support and services for the information technology component of records management. Thus, merging the implementation and information technology components of these programs within the IT group will facilitate internal coordination and create additional efficiencies by eliminating unnecessary redundant oversight and management. Furthermore, integrating records management considerations into the development and implementation of the FCCs information systems will facilitate the records retention and disposal process, and strengthen compliance with records schedules. 17. As a result of this transfer, PERM will be renamed as the Performance and Program Management PPM group in OMD. The PPM group will retain all of PERMs previous functions with the exception of records management as described above. 3. Establish a Stand-alone Enterprise Acquisition Center in OMD 18. To reflect the Commissions focus on strengthening all aspects of its procurement process, we conclude that the proper, efficient and effective dispatch of our business will be served by moving the EAC staff from the OMD Front Office and establishing EAC as a stand-alone group within OMD dedicated to the FCCs procurement activities. By establishing this group as a stand-alone entity, it is the Commissions objective to continue to improve efficiencies, independence, accountability and performance in the management of its acquisition strategy, planning and procurement activities. C. Other Rule Changes 19. In addition to the changes otherwise identified herein, we update the Commissions rules by replacing the references to the agencys Chairman with references instead to the Chairperson throughout and revise other rules that refer to chairman to instead specify chairperson.5 20. We also make minor modifications to reflect slight changes to procedures related to Privacy Act requests,6 to update rule 0.460 concerning requests for inspection and copies of records which are routinely available for public inspection to reflect current procedures, and to remove from the Code of Federal Regulations a display of approved information collections that is no longer updated and has become obsolete. We also eliminate certain Notes to rules and instead move the language from the Note into a subsection of the relevant rule to conform to the publishing conventions of the National Archives 5 This change is consistent with 1 U.S.C.  1, which provides that, with respect to statutory provisions, words importing the masculine gender include the feminine as well. 6 The FCC is updating the points of contact for Privacy Act related inquiries listed in 47 CFR  0.558. 611 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1 and Records Administrations Office of the Federal Register.7 III. PROCEDURAL MATTERS 21. Authority for the adoption of the foregoing reorganization is contained in Sections 4i, 4j, 5b, 5c, and 303r of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154i, 154j, 155b, 155c, and 303r. 22. The notice and comment and effective date provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act contained in 5 U.S.C.  553b and d do not apply either because the amendments adopted herein pertain to agency organization, procedure, and practice 8 or because there is good cause to conclude that notice and comment and delayed effectiveness are unnecessary for non-substantive, editorial revisions.9 For the same reason, no Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.  604. 23. This document does not contain new or modified information collection requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13. In addition, therefore, it does not contain any new or modified information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees, pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198 see 44 U.S.C.  3506c4. 24. The Commission has determined, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, concurs that these rules are non-major under the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C.  8042. The Commission will send a copy of this Order to Congress and the Government Accountability office, pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  801a1A. 25. Consistent with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022,10 this reorganization will not become effective until the appropriate clearance has been obtained, and the Order has thereafter been published in the Federal Register. D. ORDERING CLAUSES 26. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED THAT, pursuant to sections 4, 5b, 5c, and 303r of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  154, 155b, 155c, 303r, this Order IS ADOPTED. 27.

Given the non-substantive, editorial nature of certain revisions, and to expedite revision of the rules for the benefit of the public, we find good cause to make these rule revisions effective upon publication in the Federal Register. 10 See Pub.

Amend  1.1202 to read as follows 633 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1  1.1202 Definitions. For the purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply a Presentation. A communication directed to the merits or outcome of a proceeding, including any attachments to a written communication or documents shown in connection with an oral presentation directed to the merits or outcome of a proceeding. Excluded from this term are communications which are inadvertently or casually made, inquiries concerning compliance with procedural requirements if the procedural matter is not an area of controversy in the proceeding, statements made by decisionmakers that are limited to providing publicly available information about pending proceedings, and inquiries relating solely to the status of a proceeding, including inquiries as to the approximate time that action in a proceeding may be taken. However, a status inquiry which states or implies a view as to the merits or outcome of the proceeding or a preference for a particular party, which states why timing is important to a particular party or indicates a view as to the date by which a proceeding should be resolved, or which otherwise is intended to address the merits or outcome or to influence the timing of a proceeding is a presentation. A communication expressing concern about administrative delay or expressing concern that a proceeding be resolved expeditiously will be treated as a permissible status inquiry so long as no reason is given as to why the proceeding should be expedited other than the need to resolve administrative delay, no view is expressed as to the merits or outcome of the proceeding, and no view is expressed as to a date by which the proceeding should be resolved. A presentation by a party in a restricted proceeding not designated for hearing requesting action by a particular date or giving reasons that a proceeding should be expedited other than the need to avoid administrative delay and responsive presentations by other parties may be made on an ex parte basis subject to the provisions of  1.1204a11. b Ex parte presentation. Any presentation which 1 If written including electronic submissions transmitted in the form of texts, such as for Internet electronic mail, is not served on the parties to the proceeding or 2 If oral, is made without advance notice to the parties and without opportunity for them to be present. c Decision-making personnel. Any member, officer, or employee of the Commission, or, in the case of a Joint Board, its members or their staffs, who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in formulating a decision, rule, or order in a proceeding. Any person who has been made a party to a proceeding or who otherwise has been excluded from the decisional process shall not be treated as a decision-maker with respect to that proceeding. Thus, any person designated as part of a separate trial staff shall not be considered a decision-making person in the designated proceeding. Unseparated Bureau or Office staff shall be considered decision-making personnel with respect to decisions, rules, and orders in which their Bureau or Office participates in enacting, preparing, or reviewing. Commission staff serving as the case manager in a hearing proceeding in which the Commission is the presiding officer shall be considered decision-making personnel with respect to that hearing proceeding. d Party. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the following persons are parties 1i In a proceeding not designated for hearing, any person who files an application, waiver request, petition, motion, request for a declaratory ruling, or other filing seeking affirmative relief including a Freedom of Information Act request, and any person other than an individual viewer or listener filing comments regarding a pending broadcast application or members of Congress or their staffs or branches of the federal government or their staffs filing a written submission referencing and regarding such pending filing which is served on the filer, or, in the case of an application, any person filing a mutually exclusive application 634 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1 ii Persons who file mutually exclusive applications for services that the Commission has announced will be subject to competitive bidding or lotteries shall not be deemed parties with respect to each others' applications merely because their applications are mutually exclusive. Therefore, such applicants may make presentations to the Commission about their own applications provided that no one has become a party with respect to their application by other means, e.g., by filing a petition or other opposition against the applicant or an associated waiver request, if the petition or opposition has been served on the applicant. iii Individual listeners or viewers submitting comments regarding a pending broadcast application pursuant to  1.1204a8 will not become parties simply by service of the comments. The Media Bureau may, in its discretion, make such a commenter a party, if doing so would be conducive to the Commission's consideration of the application or would otherwise be appropriate. 2 Any person who files a complaint or request to revoke a license or other authorization or for an order to show cause which shows that the complainant has served it on the subject of the complaint or which is a formal complaint under 47 U.S.C. 208 and  1.721 of this chapter or 47 U.S.C. 255 and either  6.21 or 7.21 of this chapter, and the person who is the subject of such a complaint or request that shows service or is a formal complaint under 47 U.S.C. 208 and  1.721 of this chapter or 47 U.S.C. 255 and either  6.21 or 7.21 of this chapter 3 The subject of an order to show cause, hearing designation order, notice of apparent liability, or similar notice or order, or petition for such notice or order 4 In a proceeding designated for hearing, any person who has been given formal party status and 5 In an informal rulemaking proceeding conducted under section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act other than a proceeding for the allotment of a broadcast channel or a proceeding before a Joint Board or before the Commission to consider the recommendation of a Joint Board, members of the general public after the issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking or other order as provided under  1.1206a 1 or 2. 6 To be deemed a party, a person must make the relevant filing with the Secretary, the relevant Bureau or Office, or the Commission as a whole. Written submissions made only to the Chairperson or individual Commissioners will not confer party status. 7 The fact that a person is deemed a party for purposes of this subpart does not constitute a determination that such person has satisfied any other legal or procedural requirements, such as the operative requirements for petitions to deny or requirements as to timeliness. Nor does it constitute a determination that such person has any other procedural rights, such as the right to intervene in hearing proceedings. The Commission or the staff may also determine in particular instances that persons who qualify as parties under  1.1202d should nevertheless not be deemed parties for purposes of this subpart. 8 A member of Congress or his or her staff, or other agencies or branches of the federal government or their staffs will not become a party by service of a written submission regarding a pending proceeding that has not been designated for hearing unless the submission affirmatively seeks and warrants grant of party status. e Matter designated for hearing. Any matter that has been designated for hearing before a presiding officer. 635 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1 50.

Permittees who during the process of construction wish to engage in equipment tests shall by informal written request, submitted to the Commission electronically in ICFS not less than 30 days before they desire to begin such testing, indicate the frequencies they desire to use for testing and the hours they desire to use those frequencies. No equipment testing shall occur until the Commission has authorized frequencies and hours for such testing. Such authorizations shall be only for one season, and if it is desired to continue equipment testing in a following season, new requests for frequencies and hours must be submitted at least 30 days before it is desired to begin testing in the following season. e Within 14 days after the end of each season, a report shall be filed with the Commission electronically in ICFS by each licensee or permittee operating under program test authority who has been issued a seasonal schedule for that season.         h    2    Stations desiring to operate in this band must submit sufficient antenna performance information electronically in ICFS to ensure compliance with these restrictions.    665 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1      i    1 Requests for frequency-hours shall be accompanied by all pertinent technical data with reference to the frequencies and hours of operation, including calculated field strengths delivered to the zones or areas of reception. 2 It is preferable that calculated field strengths delivered to zones or areas of reception be equal to or greater than those required by I.F.R.B. Technical Standards, Series A and supplements thereto, in order for the I.F.R.B. to afford the notified assignment protection from interference. Nevertheless, calculated field strengths less than those required by the I.F.R.B. standards for protection will be acceptable to the Commission. However, licensees should note that if such lesser field strengths are submitted no protection from interference will be provided by the I.F.R.B. if their technical examination of such notifications show incompatibilities with other notified assignments fully complying with I.F.R.B. technical standards. 3 Licensees are permitted to engage in multiple operation as defined in  73.701d. 4 Seasonal requests for frequency-hours will be only for transmissions to zones or areas of reception specified in the basic instrument of authorization.

No. 202332080002  FRN 0021593975 NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILITY FOR FORFEITURE AND ORDER Adopted January 13, 2023 Released January 17, 2023 By the Commission I. INTRODUCTION 1. Congress established the Emergency Broadband Benefit EBB Program to provide assistance to American families by allowing eligible low-income households to receive discounts for broadband service and certain connected devices and reimbursing participating providers for providing such discounts. To ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the EBB Program, Congress and the Federal Communications Commission Commission imposed several restrictions and requirements on participating providers. Among other things, reimbursement claims for connected devices are limited to the market value for the provided device less a required co-pay. The Commission takes seriously its obligation to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in the programs it administers. As we endeavor to close the digital divide for low-income Americans through programs like the EBB Program, we are mindful we must ensure against disbursing funds to participating providers that seek to obtain the benefit of these limited resources without abiding by the Commissions rules. 2. In this Notice of Apparent Liability NAL, we propose a penalty of 62,000,000 against Q Link Wireless LLC Q Link or Company for apparently violating provisions of the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act and Commission rules and orders governing the reimbursements it claimed for providing EBB Program customers with internet-connected devices between December 2021 and March 2022. Because of these apparent violations, which involved overclaiming support for hundreds of thousands of computer tablets, Q Link apparently obtained at least 20,792,800 in improper disbursements from the EBB Program during the period under review. For these reasons, and in light of the scope, duration, and seriousness of Q Links apparent violations and the need to promote compliance with the rules, we propose the penalty detailed in this Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Order. II. BACKGROUND A. Legal Framework 3. Established by Congress on December 27, 2020, pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 Act, the 3.2 billion Emergency Broadband Connectivity Fund Fund provided resources for the Commission to establish the EBB Program to provide discounts on broadband internet service and certain internet-connected devices to eligible low-income households, including those experiencing COVID-19-related economic disruptions.1 The Act and the Commissions rules 1 See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. No. 116-260, div. N, tit. IX,  904, 134 Stat. 1182, 2129-63 2020 prior to 2021 amendment by Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No. 117-58 2021 codified at continued 677 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-2 implementing the EBB Program authorized reimbursement from the Fund to participating providers who gave such discounts. 4. In the rules governing the EBB Program, the Commission stated that, to receive reimbursement, an officer of the participating provider must certify that the connected device claimed meets the Commissions requirements, that the reimbursement claim amount reflects the market value of the device, and that the connected device has been delivered to the household.2 The Commissions stated purpose was to extend the life of the Fund by making the reimbursement claim amount reflect no more than the market value of the device.3 The Commission further directed participating providers to retain any materials that document compliance with these requirements, including the device type e.g., laptop, tablet, mobile hotspot, modem, gateway, router, antenna, receiver, or satellite dish and device make and model. We find that requiring certifications under penalty of perjury along with the possibility of an audit will help to encourage compliance with EBB Program requirements and reduce the incidence of improper payments.4 B.

At the EBB Programs end, over nine million American households benefited from subsidies for broadband services and devices,20 including students accessing virtual classrooms, adults working remotely, and people providing and receiving critical healthcare services.21 However, while the Act and the Commissions rules made it possible for approved EBB providers to be reimbursed for providing EBB connected devices to eligible households,22 providers were restricted to device subsidies that reflected the devices market value.23 9. Congress authorized the EBB Program to help increase broadband connectivity to struggling households during the pandemic, not for companies to attempt to capitalize on a crisis by overcharging taxpayers for devices and services.24 Consistent with the Acts direction to administer the EBB Program for eligible households during the COVID-19 emergency period while guarding against waste, fraud, and abuse of the Funds resources, the Commission adopted limitations on the amount EBB providers could claim for supplying connected devices and required providers to charge users a co-pay for each connected device.25 Providers seeking overpayments in violation of the rules undermine the integrity of the EBB Program. We find that, by claiming reimbursements for EBB connected devices at a rate apparently substantially exceeding their market value, Q Link apparently willfully and repeatedly 16 See Q Link Election Documentation. 17 See USAC Summary of Q Link Claims.

IX  904b5, 134 Stat. at 2132 47 CFR  54.1608e8. 24 The Act required the Commission to adopt audit requirements to ensure provider compliance with the EBB Programs requirements and to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.

Q Link Was Reimbursed in Excess of the Market Value of Its EBB Connected Devices 10. In implementing the EBB Program, the Commission tailored its rules to make support available in accordance with the Acts purposes and to safeguard the Fund from fraud, waste, and abuse.27 For example, to participate in the EBB Program, broadband internet service providers were authorized to obtain support from the program that was no more than the standard rate for an internet service offering and associated equipment, but not more than 50.00 per month.28 As the Commission found, the inclusion of a standard rate limitation was intended to prevent providers from artificially increasing prices above the usual market rate for their services for the purpose of claiming the maximum reimbursement amount.29 Similarly, Congress specified that providers could be reimbursed up to 100.00 for providing a connected device to a customers household but had to charge the household a co-pay greater than 10.00 and less than 50.00 and could receive reimbursement for only a single device per household.30 Importantly, to ensure the amount of reimbursement was fair, and to extend the Program funds for as long as possible, the Commission required that the claimed reimbursement for an EBB connected device be based on its market value.31 11. As part of Q Links notification to the Commission of its intent to participate in the EBB Program, on May 11, 2021, the Company claimed its 8-inch tablet had a retail rate of  , the customer co-payment would be 10.01, and the EBB support amount would therefore be  .32 By submitting and certifying claims for reimbursement for connected devices each month from May 2021 through March 2022 at a rate of   each,33 Q Link represented under penalty of perjury that each of its connected devices had a market value of  , comprised of the 10.01 customer co-payment it certified it charged the household plus the   reimbursement from the Fund.34 26 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub.

IX at  904b5, 134 Stat. at 2132 47 CFR  54.1603b, 54.1608d, e8. 27 As the Commission observed throughout the EBB rulemaking process, the Emergency Broadband Connectivity Fund has limited funding and we must make every effort to ensure that we maximize the use of these funds to serve as many eligible households as possible.

Market Value Analysis. The term market value is a recognized term, both generally and in the broadband internet service industry and applicable regulatory framework. As both the courts and the Commission have long recognized, the term refers to the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.42 In competitive markets with many sellers and many buyers, the market price will represent market value. The Commission has previously set the baseline for a good faith determination of fair market value by requiring carriers to use methods that are routinely used by the general business community.43 Where, as here, a product is not sold through retail channels, one cannot look to its retail price. Instead, we look to the retail prices of products that have identical or similar technical specifications. 15.

Bur. at Response to Inquiry 128 dated June 6, 2022 Q Link objected on the basis of undue burden and relevance, stating it did not in the ordinary course of its business, maintain cost records segregated and organized on a per-unit basis, and so it does not believe it has responsive information within its possession, custody, or control.. 683 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-2 obtain information from Q Links equipment supplier, Hot Pepper, Inc., in response to a subpoena, during the course of its investigation. 16. To determine whether Q Link accurately represented the market value of the Scepter 8 tablet in its EBB device claims as required by section 54.1608e8 of our rules, we must examine whether   is the market value of the tablet Q Link provided during 2021 until March 2022. Because the Scepter 8 tablet does not appear to have been available at retail and may, in fact, have only been available through Q Link, there is no retail price for the device to reference as a potential market value. Therefore, the market value must be determined by comparing the Scepter 8 tablets specifications with other widely available devices with similar specifications and characteristics and established retail prices.45 Accordingly, we conducted an analysis of the market value of the Scepter 8 tablet pursuant to the following, four-part process 1 identifying device characteristics that are likely related to market value 2 assessing whether the devices submitted by Q Link as purportedly comparable to the Scepter 8 are, in fact, comparable for purposes of assessing market value if not, 3 identifying other widely available devices having characteristics similar to various specifications of the Scepter 8 4 establishing price ranges based on devices that have characteristics similar to those of the Scepter 8 and 5 determining which devices had the most similar technical characteristics, and using those prices to determine a market value.46 17. Device specifications typically considered by consumers in selecting a device include screen size, processor speed and number of cores, memory RAM, storage ROM, battery capacity, and camera resolution.47 Generally, improvements in each of these specifications are associated with a higher retail price for the device, both because consumers are willing to pay more for higher-quality products and because improved specifications are more costly to manufacture.48 To assess whether the devices submitted by Q Link as purportedly comparable to the Scepter 8 are actually analogous, we compared those specifications. That comparison revealed 1 all but one of the devices Q Link claimed were comparable had at least double the RAM and ROM,49 and five of the seven devices had more than triple the RAM 2 while some of the devices had similar processor speeds as the Scepter 8, four of the devices had eight cores, which is double that of the Scepter 8 3 all of the claimed comparable devices had larger batteries 4 all but one of the devices had significantly better camera resolution50 and 5 some of the devices had a larger screen, and the majority of the devices had significantly better screen resolution.51 Thus, the devices submitted by Q Link had technical specifications that were significantly superior to the Scepter 8, and therefore they were not sufficiently similar for purposes of determining market value.52 18. Since we could find no devices sold at retail that were similar to the Scepter 8 in all of the technical specifications discussed above, we performed two sets of comparisons. First, we identified devices that had similar RAM, ROM and camera quality, and then we identified devices with 8-inch 45 In its submissions to USAC to substantiate market value and support its certifications, Q Link used this same methodology of relying on the online retail price of purportedly comparable devices to determine market value. See email from Issa Asad to Zac St. Martin Nov. 16, 2021 attaching comparisons in the form of a series of screenshots of other tablet devices available online and claiming  . 46 See Attachment 2, Analysis of Market Value, at para. 4. 47 Id. at para. 5. 48 Id. 49 The remaining comparable, although having the same amount of ROM as the Scepter 8, has twice as much RAM and a much larger screen of 13 inches, compared to the 8-inch screen of the Scepter 8. 50 While that one device has a comparable camera, it is significantly better than the Scepter 8 in all other respects. 51 Attachment 2, Analysis of Market Value, at para. 9 and Table 1. 52 Id. at para. 10. 684 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-2 screens and somewhat similar processor speeds. Those tablets with similar RAM, ROM, and camera quality had only 7-inch screens and lower battery capacities, and some had slightly lower clock speeds.53 Looking at devices with 8-inch screens and processors with clock speeds reasonably similar to those of the Scepter 8, they also had other specifications that were significantly superior to the Scepter 8. For example, all the devices had twice the ROM and all but one had twice the RAM as the Scepter 8 all had cameras with more than twice the resolution of the cameras included with the Scepter 8 and all but one of the devices had larger batteries than the Scepter 8.54 19. We then closely examined the devices we had identified to determine a subset of devices that were closest to the Scepter 8 in terms of the selected specifications. Among the 7-inch devices, the two devices that were most similar to the Scepter 8 in terms of the technical specifications we examined were the Hyundai HyTab 7WC1, which had a price of 50 to 60 during the relevant period, and the Amazon Fire 7, which had a price of 65 50 with an ad-supported lock screen. Based on the prices of these devices, we find a reasonable floor for the market value of the Scepter 8 would be 50. 20. Among the devices with an 8-inch screen, the device most similar to the Scepter 8 in terms of the technical specifications we examined was the Hyundai HyTab 8WC1, which sold for 70 during the relevant period. It had the same processor and RAM as the Scepter 8, but twice the ROM, a slightly faster processor speed and a better camera. Given that it has several technical specifications that are superior to the Scepter 8, we find that the market value of the Scepter 8 must be less than 70.55 21. Based on our examination of devices with similar technical specifications, in this particular case, our best determination of the market value of the Scepter 8 is 60.00, which is the mid- point in the range of prices of the devices we found most comparable. Several factors support this conclusion and suggest that the market value of the Scepter 8 should tend towards the low end of the market. First, the Scepter 8, unlike the Amazon Fire, is not a brand name tablet, and name brand products generally command higher prices as they may signal higher quality components to consumers. Second, the Scepter 8 does not appear to have been sold anywhere at retail. Third, while customer reviews of the Scepter 8 are limited, the reviews on YouTube and reseller websites were largely negative as to the quality of the device.56 Relatedly, the PassMark Android device benchmarking app ranks the Scepter 8 device 4,358th out of 4,400 tablet and smartphone devices, which puts it in the bottom 2 percent in terms of benchmark scores.57 22. Finally, as we have noted, two somewhat similar devices with 8-inch screens  the Hyundai 8WC1, with a better camera, double the ROM and a higher capacity battery and the Gateway 8\", with more RAM and more ROM  sold for only 70.00 and 65.00, respectively, during the relevant period. If one deducts from the 70.00 price of the Hyundai 8WC1 the likely incremental value of the increased ROM, the better camera and the larger capacity battery, which together likely well exceed 10.00, the retail price of such a device would be below 60.00. Likewise, a similar exercise for the 53 Id. at paras. 12-13 and Table 2. 54 Id. at para. 15 and Table 3. 55 Specifically, we observe that tablets with better features generally command higher retail prices than their otherwise identical counterparts. For example, the Hyundai 8WB1 has 1 GB of additional RAM and 3MP of additional camera resolution compared to the Hyundai 8WC1 and costs 10 more. The Fire 7 with 32 GB of ROM costs 20 more than an identical Fire 7 tablet with 16GB of ROM. 56 See, e.g., Mr. Goody, Q-Link Wireless Scepter 8 Tablet Product Test And Review Jan. 22, 2022, httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vkV4PfJzy9c8 Neal Adams, Qlink Scepter 8 tablet review.

For these reasons, we find that the market value of the Scepter 8 is, at most, 60.00. 23. Thus, Q Links assertion that the Scepter 8 has a market value of   is not supported by the information provided by the Company, nor is it supported by analyzing comparable devices available during the same time frame. As a result, apparently Q Link has been reimbursed substantially in excess of the Scepter 8s objective market value. We find that Q Link has apparently received an overpayment of at least   per device for each of the   connected devices for which it claimed reimbursement during the EBB Program. 24. Q Link had access to the same information we use in this analysis. Thus, Q Link knew or should have known the market value of its device was far less than it claimed when it sought reimbursement, and that the technical specifications of the Companys device were substantially inferior to those that Q Link asserted were comparable. Despite this, the Company falsely stated in its election notice that the market value of the device was  .58 Furthermore, Q Links Chief Executive Officer certified with each monthly claim for reimbursement during the entire EBB Program that the amount Q Link claimed reflected the market value of the device,59 and he certified that the information contained in each claim was true, complete, and accurate to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief.60 From May 2021 through March 2022, Q Link sought reimbursement from the Fund for devices at a rate substantially in excess of their market value, falsely certified as to their market value, and claimed amounts from the Fund again substantially in excess of those to which it was entitled under the rules. 25. In correspondence with USAC in November 2021, Q Link claimed that its EBB connected device and the reimbursement rate had been approved by USAC.61 To the contrary, the Commission did not authorize USAC to pre-approve any EBB connected device market values. Significantly, in the EBB rulemaking, the Commission rejected requests from commenters who advocated to pre-approve the retail value of connected devices.62 Instead, the Commission said it would forego a pre-approval process for policy reasons and would use back-end audits to keep participants honest about claiming reimbursement for only the market value of devices to ensure the quick reimbursement of valid claims for connected devices, USAC will not be required collect and review documentation before processing a reimbursement claim. Instead, we require providers, under penalty of perjury, to certify that the connected device meets the Commissions requirements, that the reimbursement claim amount reflects the market value of the device, that the household has been charged a compliant co-pay amount, and that the connected device has been delivered to the household.63 Consequently, USAC did not approve Q Links reimbursement rate for EBB connected devices. 58 QLINK-98-000112-CONFIDENTIAL stating retail rate of   on Election Documentation. 59 See 47 CFR  54.1608e8 Attachment 1, Table of Q Link EBB Device Reimbursement Claims at col.

In light of our rejection of Q Links assertions in its LOI responses, its EBB election materials, monthly certifications that its connected device had a market value of  , and the other information assembled in the Bureaus investigation, including the economic analysis of Q Links device, we find that Q Link apparently violated section 904b5 of the Act as well as sections 54.1603b, 54.1608d, and 54.1608e8 of the Commissions rules by certifying and claiming connected devices at a rate that apparently substantially exceeded their market value and thus exceeded the amount of reimbursement permitted under the EBB Program.64 Specifically, the   per device reimbursement amount claimed by Q Link added to the 10.01 co-pay the Company reportedly charged device recipients resulted in the   per device market value asserted by the Company. However, as explained above, the market value for the Scepter 8 tablet is at most 60.00. Thus, the maximum per device reimbursement allowable under the Commissions rules was 49.99 the market value of 60.00, minus the 10.01 co-pay. As a result, we find that Q Link apparently received an approximate overpayment of approximately 50 per device for   devices between May 12, 2021 and March 15, 2022. Thus, Q Link apparently claimed and received overpayments from the Fund of approximately 32,900,700.00 over the course of the EBB Program. Focusing on the months at issue in the Bureaus investigation, we find Q Link apparently claimed excessive reimbursements for   EBB connected devices between December 16, 2021 and March 15, 2022, for an overcollection from the Fund of at least 20,792,800.00. B. Proposed Forfeiture 27. Section 503b of the Communications Act of 1934 Communications Act authorizes the Commission to impose a forfeiture against any entity that willfully or repeatedly fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Communications Act or of any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commission.65 Here, section 503b2B of the Communications Act authorizes us to assess a forfeiture against Q Link of up to 237,268.00 for each day of a continuing violation, up to a statutory maximum of 2,372,677.00 for a single act or failure to act.66 In exercising our forfeiture authority, we must consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may require.67 In addition, the Commission has established forfeiture guidelines they establish base penalties for certain violations and identify criteria that we consider when determining the appropriate penalty in any given case.68 Under these guidelines, we may adjust a forfeiture upward for violations that are egregious, intentional, or repeated, or that cause substantial harm or generate substantial economic gain for the violator.69 28. In this case, Q Link apparently claimed reimbursement from the EBB Program substantially in excess of the market value of its connected devices each month from December 16, 2021 to March 15, 2022, thereby preventing those funds from assisting other eligible households. Based on our analysis of the connected devices technical specifications and retail prices of comparable devices that were 64 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 116-260, div. N, tit. IX  904b5, 134 Stat. at 2132 47 CFR  54.1603b, 54.1608d, e8 see also EBB Program Order, 36 FCC Rcd at 4660, para. 97. 65 47 U.S.C.  503b. 66 See 47 U.S.C.  503b2B 47 CFR  1.80b2. These amounts reflect the inflationary adjustments to the forfeitures specified in section 503b of the Communications Act. See Amendment of Section 1.80b of the Commissions Rules, Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties to Reflect Inflation, Order, DA 22-1356, 2022 WL 18023008 EB Dec. 23, 2022 see also Annual Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties to Reflect Inflation, 87 Fed. Reg. 783 Jan. 5, 2023 setting January 15, 2023, as the effective date for the increases. 67 47 U.S.C.  503b2E. 68 47 CFR  1.80b10, Note to paragraph b10. 69 Id. 687 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-2 widely available at the time, we have concluded Q Links claims requested approximately   more than market value per device. During the period relevant to our investigation, Q Link claimed excessive reimbursement for   EBB connected devices for an apparent total overcollection from the Fund of approximately 20,792,800.00. We consider each device Q Link claimed and certified for reimbursement above market value as a separate violation therefore, Q Link had a total of   violations of section 904b5 of the Act and sections 54.1603b, 54.1608d, and 54.1608e8.70 29. Because the EBB Program rules are new, neither the Commissions forfeiture guidelines nor its case law have established a base forfeiture for violations of rules governing claims for EBB connected devices. Based on the totality of the circumstances in this case, including consideration of the factors set forth in section 503b2E of the Communications Act, we determine that a forfeiture amount based on treble the harm to the Fund is appropriate. The Commission has previously proposed forfeitures based, in part, on three times the amount of improper reimbursements for monthly Lifeline service to customers from the Universal Service Fund,71 as well as in the context of a companys failure to pay regulatory fees.72 Every dollar misdirected from the EBB Program to providers that violate our rules is a dollar that could instead have been used to make broadband service more affordable for low-income Americans, and we consider the proposed approach to be appropriate to both penalize Q Links violations of the EBB Program rules and to deter those broadband service providers that fail to devote sufficient resources to prevent company practices resulting in overcollection violations, such as inflating the amount claimed for connected devices above market value. Although we reserve for a separate action a final determination of exact amount of Q Links apparent overcollection from the Fund, as discussed above, Q Link apparently claimed at least   per device above the amount to which it was entitled. 30. Therefore, we propose a forfeiture penalty of 62,000,000.00 against Q Link for the apparent violations of section 904b5 of the Act and sections 54.1603b, 54.1608d, and 54.1608e8.73 If an EBB service provider violates our rules and submits a request for program support that it knew or should have known exceeds the market value of its connected devices, and thus requests andor receives more reimbursement from the Fund than the amount to which it is properly entitled, it undermines the support reimbursement mechanism. The Commission believes that the imposition of a significant forfeiture amount upon Q Link is a necessary response to overcollection violations, particularly in programs that benefit households in need of support for telecommunications and broadband service and devices. Service providers participating in these programs must take care to ensure compliance with the Commissions rules, especially the rules and procedures requiring that providers request andor receive federal support only in the amounts permitted under the rules. 31. In addition, in light of Q Links apparent misconduct and the resulting harm to the Fund, we order Q Link to respond in writing within 30 days of the release of this NAL explaining why the 70 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub.

We direct Q Link to address the full range of its participation in the EBB and ACP programs, including the accuracy of its certifications and other representations to the Commission and any other potential failures to comply with program requirements. The Commission remains committed to maintaining service to all eligible customers and will work to ensure continued service. IV. CONCLUSION 32. We have determined that Q Link apparently willfully and repeatedly violated section 904b5 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 116-260, div. N, tit. IX, 134 Stat. at 2132,75 and sections 54.1603b, 54.1608d, and 54.1608e8 of the Commissions rules. As such, Q Link is apparently liable for a forfeiture of 62,000,000.00. V. ORDERING CLAUSES 33.

Because neither the Scepter 8 nor an identical tablet was sold through any major retailers during the EBB Program, we cannot look to the retail price as an estimate of market value. Instead, we looked to the retail prices of devices with similar specifications. 2. Given the unusual combination of technical specifications in the Scepter 8, we did not find directly comparable devices. Although the Scepter 8 has an 8-inch screen like many higher-end devices, it has memory RAM, storage ROM, and camera resolution similar to lower-tier devices with a 7-inch screen. Introduction And Overview of Methodology 3. The phrase market value has been defined as the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. In competitive markets with many sellers and many buyers, the interaction of supply and demand generally will determine market price, which will also represent market value. Here, however, as indicated above, the Scepter 8 was not sold through any major retailers, so one cannot look to its market price to estimate market value. 4. Our analysis proceeded as follows o First, we identified technical specifications that are likely related to market value. o Then, we analyzed the devices submitted by Q Link as purportedly comparable to the Scepter 8, based on the technical specifications that were identified in the first step. o We then identified other widely-available devices that had various specifications similar to the Scepter 8.1 Because of the unusual mix of technical specifications in the Scepter 8, we separately examined devices with 7-inch screens and those with 8-inch screens. o Fourth, we used the retail prices of these devices to establish a market value range. o Fifth, we determined which devices had the most similar specifications, and used those prices to determine a market value for the Scepter 8. Relevant Device Specifications 5. In identifying devices to compare with the Scepter 8, we examined the following technical specifications, since these specifications are generally advertised on retail websites and buying 1 Note that this approach is similar to that taken by Q Link, when it submitted data on the market prices of devices it claimed were similar to the Scepter 8 to justify the price it charged for the device. However, as discussed below, the technical specifications of the devices identified as comparable by Q Link do not appear closely comparable to those of the Scepter 8. 693 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-2 guides, and they are technical specifications typically considered by consumers in selecting a device2  Screen size  Processor speed and number of cores  Memory RAM  Storage ROM  Battery capacity  Camera Resolution In general, for each of these specifications, an improvement in the specification is associated with a higher retail price for the device, both because consumers are willing to pay more for higher- quality products and because devices with improved technical specifications are more costly to manufacture.3 For example, in comparing otherwise identical devices, those with more RAM or ROM will likely have higher prices.4 Similarly, where a manufacturer sells otherwise identical devices with different screen sizes, the device with the larger screen generally has a higher price. 6. While the analyses below incorporate specifications that are most likely to be the best predictors for the market value of a device, unmeasured or unmeasurable characteristics of a device may also affect market value. For example brand name, quality of components, overall device 2 Consumer buying guides typically list these technical specifications as worth considering when deciding which device to purchase.

The available evidence suggests that along many, if not all, of these less easily measured device characteristics, the Scepter 8 tablet would either underperform competitor products or would not be appreciably different.5 Consequently, the market value of the Scepter 8 should be expected to be on the low end of devices with similar technical specifications. 8. We collected technical specifications and prices of devices with similar specifications that were sold by major retailers. Technical specifications were collected from retailer websites, manufacturer websites, publicly available device manuals, and FCC engineering certifications. For each device, where possible, multiple sources were checked. Device prices were gathered using price aggregators and website archives spanning from a month prior to the adoption of the EBB Program rules on February 25, 2021, to March 15, 2022, the end of EBB program claim submissions to USAC.6 In particular, CamelCamelCamel is an Amazon.com price aggregator that provides the price history of a product listing.7 In addition, the Wayback Machine is an archive of websites. While not all websites are archived, there are snapshots of retailer websites that provide price information on tablets that were available.8 Evaluation of Devices Q-Link Submitted as Comparable 9. As a starting point for the analysis, we examined the technical specifications of the devices that Q Link submitted as comparable to the Scepter 8.9 See Table 1. All the devices cited by Q Link are 5 Although reviews for the Scepter 8 are limited, reviews found on YouTube and reseller websites were largely negative as to the quality of the device. Similarly, the PassMark Android device benchmarking app ranks the Scepter 8 4358 out of 4400 tablet and smartphone devices. This puts it in the bottom 2 percent of benchmark scores.

As indicated in Table 3, the 8-inch devices we identified generally had higher prices than the 7- inch devices listed in Table 2 as one would expect, but also had other technical specifications that were significantly superior to the Scepter 8. For example, all the devices in Table 3 had twice the ROM and all but one had twice the RAM as the Scepter 8. In addition, most had cameras with more than twice the resolution of the cameras included with the Scepter 8. Finally, all but one of the devices had larger batteries than the Scepter 8. Despite many superior technical specifications, the prices of all these devices were still below Q-Links claimed reimbursement rate for the Scepter 8. Specifically, the prices of the devices in Table 3 range from 64.99 to 82.99, which again is significantly below the market value claimed by Q-Link for the Scepter 8. In addition, at least two of the five devices had the same Allwinner A100 processor that was used in the Scepter 8 during this period.16 These two devices had the same processor as the Scepter 8, but more ROM, better camera resolution, and a larger battery capacity than the Scepter 8, yet both were sold at lower prices, with the lowest cost device sold at   less than the claimed market value of the Scepter 8. 15 Currently, Amazon sells versions of its tablets with and without ad-supported lock screens. The tablet costs 15 more without an ad-supported lock screen.

Because it is unclear whether the Amazon Fire device found at Best Buy includes ads, an additional 15 is added to the price to account for the possible removal of the ads. Amazon makes you pay back any discount you received on your tablet when you agreed to see ads. The cost to remove them later will be around 15 to 20.

These systems-on-a-chip SoCs designs integrate the RAM and graphics into a single silicon chip. This has some implications, as two similar chips processor cores may have different amounts of memory and different graphics engines, which can cause variations in performance. Manufacturers might alter the design, but for the most part, performance is similar between products within the same base design.

Given the fairly broad range of prices and technical specifications for devices identified in Tables 2 and 3, each of the identified devices was closely examined to identify those devices that were closest to the Scepter 8 in terms of their technical specifications. In making this determination additional factors were considered, such as whether the device is bundled with additional accessories, whether it was targeted towards children, or was from a well-known tablet manufacturer that may signal higher quality components. Among the 7-inch screen devices listed in Table 2, the following two devices we identified as closest to the Scepter 8. First, was the Hyundai HyTab 7WC1 it had the same processor as the Scepter 8, but twice the ROM and a better camera.17 It had a price of 50.00 to 60.00 during the relevant period. 16. The second device identified was the Amazon Fire 7, which was and is widely sold it has the same RAM and ROM as the Scepter 8, an only slightly slower clock speed processor, but it has a better camera and is a brand name product. It sold for between 50.00 and 65.00. 17. Among the 8-inch devices listed in Table 3, the device we identified as most similar was the Hyundai HyTab 8WC1. It had the same processor and RAM as the Scepter 8, but it had twice the ROM and it had a slightly faster processor and a better camera. It sold for 70.00. 18. Based on this analysis of the retail prices for the most comparable tablets sold during the same time period, it appears that a conservative estimate of the market value of the Scepter 8 is between 50.00 and something less than 70.00. This conclusion is based on the following observations. First, the 8-inch tablet with the technical specifications most similar to the Scepter 8 is the Hyundai 8WC1. The 8WC1 had the same Allwinner A100 processor, but a better camera, double the ROM, and a higher capacity battery, and it sold for only 70.00 during the relevant period. Given that it has so many technical specifications that are superior to the Scepter 8, a 70.00 upper bound is conservative. Also, the Gateway 8, with more RAM and more ROM  sold for only 65 during the relevant period. Second, while there are some tablets in our 17 While the Contixo V8 had technical specifications more similar to the Scepter 8 than the HyTab 7WC1, as noted above it is also a tablet targeted at parents with children that comes with a bumper and educational software and parental controls. These extra features tend to increase the price of a tablet and therefore we concluded that the 7WC1 was the closest comparable. 699 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-2 analysis that sold for 80.00, these tablets were either tablets targeted at parents with children that are bundled with features that significantly raise retail prices or were tablets, such as the Coopers CP80 and Hyundai 8WB1, that have technical specifications far superior to the Scepter 8. Further, an analysis of the incremental value of adding these types of upgrades to a tablet shows that these superior features would be expected to raise the market value by at least 10.00, but likely closer to 20.00.18 18 For example, the Hyundai 8WB1 has 1 GB of additional RAM and 3MP of additional camera resolution compared to the Hyundai 8WC1 and costs 10.00 more. Also, the Fire 7\" with 32 GB of ROM costs 20.00 more than an identical Fire 7\" tablet with 16GB of ROM. 700 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-2 Appendix The table below lists the historical prices found for the devices presented in this analysis.

INTRODUCTION 1. In this Seventh Report and Order and Ninth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we establish a comprehensive and coordinated nationwide approach to managing the 4.9 GHz 4940-4990 MHz band while retaining its locally controlled, public safety nature. In doing so, we solidify the bands status as public safety spectrum, while also allowing secondary, non-public safety use as agreed to by public safety licensees through a new leasing model. Critical to this vision for the 4.9 GHz band is the addition of a nationwide Band Manager, which will be selected based on its expertise and connections to the public safety community and will coordinate all operations in the band to ensure that any non-public safety use remains fully secondary to, and preemptible by, public safety operations. This nationwide framework will optimize public safety use and enable the integration of the latest commercially available technologies, such as 5G. 2. The Seventh Report and Order also modifies our rules to allow for the collection of granular data on public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band. These data combined with a formal coordination structure performed by the Band Manager will improve interference mitigation efforts, bolster public safety confidence in the band, and will play a crucial role in the Band Managers ability to find opportunities for secondary, non-public safety access. We also make several changes to the technical rules for the band to promote more robust public safety operations. Finally, in the Ninth Further Notice, we seek comment on the details of implementing the new leasing model to achieve our goals of allowing robust locally controlled public safety operations while ensuring consistent, nationwide rules that promote overall spectral efficiency, foster innovation, and drive down equipment costs. II. BACKGROUND A. Current 4.9 GHz Band Rules 3. The current licensing and regulatory regime for the 4.9 GHz band is significantly different from other public safety bands. As an initial matter, the 4.9 GHz band has looser eligibility requirements unlike the 700 MHz band which has statutorily defined eligibility criteria,1 or the Public Safety pool which has Commission-defined eligibility criteria,2 an entity need only provide public safety 1 See 47 U.S.C.  337f1B. 2 See 47 CFR  90.20. 705 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 services to be eligible for a 4.9 GHz license.3 Licensees include state and local government entities,4 as well as nongovernmental organizations NGOs that support communications essential to services having the sole or principal purpose of protecting the safety of life, health, or property.5 4. The 4.9 GHz band is shared amongst eligible licenseesno licensee has a right to exclusive, or interference free, access to the band.6 Similarly, unlike other public safety bands that only authorize operations on specific frequencies and in clearly delineated geographic areas, 4.9 GHz band licenses authorize operation on any channel over the entire 50 megahertz of the band and are generally issued for the geographic area encompassing the legal jurisdiction of the licensee.7 Moreover, a 4.9 GHz licensee has blanket authority to operate base stations and mobile units including portables and handheld units andor temporary one year or less fixed stations anywhere within its authorized area.8 Our rules also permit eligible entities to license fixed point-to-point P-P and point-to-multipoint P-MP operations on specific channels within their jurisdictions, although only those fixed sites that are used to deliver broadband service are accorded primary status under the rules.9 5. While licensees in this band are geographically limited to the state or local jurisdictions specified on the license,10 they are also permitted to operate base stations with mobile units and temporary fixed stations outside their authorized area with the permission of the jurisdiction in which they will operate.11 This licensing scheme means that licenses often overlap with one or more geographic area licenses covering a given location and authorizing operations on the same spectrum, as well as multiple fixed-site licenses in the same area.12 The Commission established this flexible structure based on public safety agencies unique history of coordination with one another in the use of shared frequencies.13 Our 4.9 GHz rules, however, historically have not specified a formal coordination requirement.14 3 Id.  90.1203a referring to 47 CFR  90.523b which allows a nongovernmental organization that provides services, the sole or principal purpose of which is to protect the safety of life, health, or property, to hold a license in the band. 4 Id.  90.523a. 5 Id.  90.523b. In addition, to establish eligibility, a NGO must also secure and maintain the support for the right to operate its system from a state or local governmental entity whose mission is to oversee or provide services that have the sole or principal purpose of protecting the safety of life, health or property, and the NGO must provide a written certification of such support in any submitted application. Id. 6 Id.  90.1209a. 7 Id.  90.1207a. In the case of a NGO, the license is issued for the legal jurisdiction of the state or local government entity supporting the NGO. Id. Some licenses are issued for only part of a licensees jurisdiction, for example, an area defined by a point and a specified radius of operation. 8 Id.  90.1207b. 9 Id.  90.1207d. 10 Id.  90.1207. 11 Id.  90.1207c. 12 For example, a common scenario might involve a statewide license held by the state police, a county-wide license held by the sheriffs department, and fixed-site licenses operating in the same area by various public safety entities. Licensees informally cooperate with one another to ensure that their operations do not cause interference with one another, and to resolve interference if it occurs. 13 The 4.9 GHz Band Transferred from Federal Government Use, Memorandum Opinion and Order and Third Report and Order, 18 FCC Rcd 9152, 9164, para. 28 2003 4.9 GHz Third Report and Order We note that many public safety agencies already have procedures or protocols in place with nearby jurisdictions to govern frequency sharing during situations requiring joint operations. The Commission also explained that the nature of public safety operations in general will . . . facilitate this sharing requirement.. 14 47 CFR  90.175j22, 90.1209b. 706 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 B. Current State of the 4.9 GHz Band 6. There are 3,541 licenses currently issued in the band.15 This includes 137 statewide area licenses, 1,145 countywide area licenses, and 2,259 other licenses, either for geographic area licenses or other types such as for a group of counties, a city, or parts of one or more cities or for fixed sites.16 Most of the United States and U.S. territories are covered by at least one statewide license.17 In some states, multiple state entities hold statewide licenses.18 Licensees use P-P and P-MP operations, to facilitate video streaming, communications system backhaul, and data connections for advanced devices.19 Commenters have suggested that emerging and potential uses of the band may include robotics and airborne operations, as well as the Internet of Things.20 C. Procedural History 7. In 2002, the Commission designated the 4.9 GHz band for public safety use.21 Operations in the band are limited to those in support of public safety operations22 and licenses for the band are exclusively available to public safety entities or those operating in support of public safety.23 Since the designation of the band, the rules have evolved in response to changing conditions, including 15 Universal Licensing System, FCC, httpswireless2.fcc.govUlsAppUlsSearchsearchLicense.jsp last visited Jan. 10, 2023. 16 For example, Southwestern NH District Fire Mutual Aid holds a license, call sign WQNM520, covering three counties in New Hampshire. 17 The following statesterritories are not covered by a statewide license American Samoa, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, the Northern Mariana Islands, and South Dakota. 18 For example, the State of Maryland holds a statewide 4.9 GHz band license WPYX998, as do four other agencies of the Maryland state government Maryland State Highway Administration  WQAN291 Maryland Department of Information Technology  WPYZ305 Maryland DNR  WPYT728 Maryland MIEMSS  WQAL856. 19 Amendment of Part 90 of the Commissions Rules, WP Docket No. 07-100, Order on Reconsideration and Eighth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 36 FCC Rcd 15032, 15036, para. 9 2021 Order on Reconsideration or Eighth Further Notice. 20 Letter from Ralph A.

Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WP Docket No. 07-100, at 3 filed Aug. 13, 2021 NPSTC Aug. 13, 2021, Ex Parte The NPSTC recommendations incorporate provisions for new public safety operations that advances in robotics, the internet of things IoT and unmanned aerial systems technologies are generating. see also IAFC Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 6-7 The IAFC also agrees with NPSTC that 4.9 GHz spectrum can be instrumental in supporting emerging technologies beneficial to public safety, including aeronautical, both manned and unmanned UAS, robotics and the public safety Internet of Things PS IoT. EWA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 8-9 Designating specific 4.9 GHz channels for UAS, for robotics, and for IoT technologies will further promote efficient use of this spectrum.. While Commission rule, section 90.1205c, 47 CFR  90.1205c, currently prohibits aeronautical mobile operations, some operations have been authorized through rule waiver. See, e.g., City of Long Beach, California, call sign WQJE424. 21 See The 4.9 GHz Band Transferred from Federal Government Use, WT Docket No. 00-32, Second Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 17 FCC Rcd 3955 2002 Second Report and Order. 22 47 CFR  90.1203b. 23 Id.  90.1203a. 707 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 band use and technological innovation.24 In these endeavors, the Commission has sought to increase the use of the band with the goal of maximizing the spectrums potential.25 8. Sixth Further Notice. On March 23, 2018, the Commission adopted the Sixth Further Notice. The Notice, drawing on comments in the record as well as a plan submitted by NPSTC in 2013 and a report provided by APCO in 2015,26 sought comment on several alternatives to stimulate investment in, as well as expand use of, the 4.9 GHz band. 9. Freeze Public Notice. In an effort to stabilize the band while the Commission considers changes to its rules as part of this proceeding,27 on September 8, 2020, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau PSHSB and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau WTB collectively the Bureaus announced a freeze on applications in the 4.9 GHz band.28 Pursuant to the Freeze Public Notice, the Bureaus stopped accepting applications for new or modified licenses, including both geographic area licenses and individual fixed-site licenses.29 10. Sixth Report and Order and Seventh Further Notice. On September 30, 2020, the Commission adopted the Sixth Report and Order and Seventh Further Notice in this proceeding.30 The new leasing framework adopted in the Sixth Report and Order granted states the option to lease spectrum access through a single statewide entity designated as the State Lessor to state and local entitieswhether public safety or non-public safetyas well as to commercial and other private entities in their 24 See, e.g., Order on Reconsideration and Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 15032 Amendment of Part 90 of the Commissions Rules, WP Docket No. 07-100, Sixth Report and Order and Seventh Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 36 FCC Rcd 1958 2020 Sixth Report and Order or Seventh Further Notice Amendment of Part 90 of the Commissions Rules, WP Docket No. 07-100, Sixth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 33 FCC Rcd 3261 2018 Sixth Further Notice. 25 The Commission has also received extensive input from public safety organizations such as the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International, Inc.

Id. at 9523. 29 See Freeze Public Notice. 30 Sixth Report and Order, 36 FCC Rcd at 1959. In the Seventh Further Notice, the Commission, among other things, proposed an expansion of the new state-based framework to include public safety operations and proposed to amend its 4.9 GHz licensing rules to limit future licensing to state entities seeking a statewide license in states without an existing statewide license for purposes of this coordination.

Order on Reconsideration and Eighth Further Notice. The Commission subsequently adopted the Order on Reconsideration and Eighth Further Notice on September 30, 2021.33 The Order on Reconsideration, issued before the framework adopted in the Sixth Report and Order could become effective, granted three public safety organization petitions insofar as they sought reconsideration of the rules adopted in the Sixth Report and Order.34 We agreed that, rather than allowing State Lessors to use and lease the band for non-public safety purposes, the public interest would be better served by considering other models, in particular those that advanced a single, nationwide framework for the band. As discussed below, the Commission also directed the Bureaus to lift, in part, the licensing freeze adopted in advance of the Sixth Report and Order, thereby allowing incumbents to modify their existing licenses or to license new permanent fixed sites. The freeze was to remain in place as to non-incumbent applicants for 4.9 GHz band licenses. 12. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission sought comment on important technical and policy questions concerning how to maximize the use of the band to support public safety, leverage technological advancements such as 5G, foster a robust equipment market, and address non-public safety use of the band on a nationwide basis.35 In contrast to the State Lessor model, which would have led to different practices for the band in different states, the Commission sought comment on a unified approach across the entire country. We thus sought input on requiring formal frequency coordination in the 4.9 GHz band to support interference protection and increase public safety confidence in using the band.36 In addition, the Commission asked about the role of the Regional Planning Committees RPCs, and whether, if we adopted frequency coordination requirements, the RPCs have the technical expertise and resources to serve as coordinators.37 We also solicited feedback on several alternatives to promote innovation, stimulate investment, and facilitate robust public safety access in the 4.9 GHz band.38 Further, the Commission sought comment on establishing a database that would contain consistent and reliable information about what spectrum is available and where and how it is being used.39 13. Alongside these potential changes, the Commission inquired about allowing non-public safety use of the band to encourage a more robust and innovative equipment market without causing 31 Sixth Report and Order, 36 FCC Rcd at 1959, para. 2.

In addition, we sought comment on implementing a nationwide spectrum management framework reflecting public safety input that will promote more opportunistic use of the 4.9 GHz band without compromising the integrity and security of public safety operations.41 More specifically, the Commission asked about designating a single entity to serve as a nationwide band manager or licensee for the 4.9 GHz band and what its responsibilities would be under such an approach.42 15. Freeze Modification Public Notice. On October 21, 2021, pursuant to the Order on Reconsideration, the Bureaus amended the freeze to allow those with existing 4.9 GHz licenses to seek to modify those licenses, whether for permanent fixed sites or geographic areas, as permitted under the rules.43 III. SEVENTH REPORT AND ORDER A. Overview and Key Findings 16. Today we adopt rules that create a comprehensive and coordinated nationwide approach to the 4.9 GHz band, centralizing management in a single Band Manager, while retaining local control over operations conducted by individual public safety licensees. This framework will retain the bands existing status as a locally controlled public safety band, but with more rationalized and coordinated public safety operations on a nationwide level. Each licensee will retain the authority to decide for itself how best to use the band, given its unique circumstances and needs, but within the context of a predictable and consistent spectral framework nationwide. This will enable greater public safety use, including for 5G, and allow the Band Manager to work with public safety licensees to rationalize their use and consolidate their operations, potentially freeing up new opportunities for expanded use. These expanded operations will encompass both primary public safety use and, subject to coordination by the Band Manager, secondary non-public safety use, the latter of which will be subject to preemption by public safety operations. This balanced approach will spur innovation and drive down costs, enabling more efficient use of this important mid-band spectrum. 17. Implementing a centralized coordination strategy will provide better information and certainty about existing users and public safety deployments, which in turn will help leverage new technologies, lower equipment costs, attract new users, facilitate effective frequency coordination and interference protection, and promote interoperability. We believe this structure will foster greater development and deployment of 4.9 GHz band equipment and systems, increasing spectral efficiency and furthering the public interest, while retaining the operational flexibility and local control that have been 40 Id. at 15054-60, paras. 61-86. 41 Id. at 15042-62, paras. 27-89 see also Sixth Further Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 3262, para. 3. 42 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15050-51, paras. 51-53. 43 Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Modify Temporary Filing Freeze on the Acceptance and Processing of Certain Part 90 Applications for the 4940-4990 MHz Band, WP Docket No. 07-100, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 15185 PSHSBWTB 2021 Freeze Modification Public Notice Order on Reconsideration, 36 FCC Rcd at 15041-42, para. 25. In the Order on Reconsideration we gave the example that an incumbent licensee is permitted to add base stations within its jurisdiction. 47 CFR  90.1207c. Also, an incumbent licensee may continue to seek an individual station license if required pursuant to Commission rule section 90.1207b1. Id.  90.1207b1. In addition to new deployments within its jurisdiction pursuant to an existing geographic area license, a public safety entity may expand operations through leasing from a State Lessor.

This will move the band away from being underutilized and towards being a workhorse not only for public safety operations, but also for non-public safety uses. B. Band Manager 18. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission sought comment on revisions to the 4.9 GHz service rules to expand access to the band, spur innovation, improve coordination, and drive down costs for operators and end users through a new, nationwide framework for the band.44 We noted the critical importance of incumbent public safety operations and the need to preserve local control over the band, both to accommodate the localized nature of public safety operations and to continue to allow the wide range of public safety uses that the band hosts.45 At the same time, we emphasized that it was crucial that there be a single set of rules governing the band nationwide.46 We pointed out that centralizing management of the band would help ensure that public safety operators have consistent rules and a harmonized equipment marketplace, and that any non-public safety use would be standardized and predictable.47 19. The Commission also solicited comment on different ways to balance these goals, including via designation of a nationwide Band Manager.48 We pointed to our experience with band managers in the 700 MHz Guard Bands and the 220 MHz band as precedents for using such an entity to establish a nationwide framework here.49 Commenters expressed significant support for a nationwide band manager stating that doing so further ensures public safety interoperability50 and that it is the most effective way to maximize the utilization of the 4.9 GHz band.51 20. In this Seventh Report and Order, we adopt a single, nationwide framework for the 4.9 GHz band, that is centered around a new Band Manager, which will be equipped with additional information about the current public safety use of the band and empowered to work with public safety licensees to ensure efficient use of this spectrum and enable new, non-commercial operations on a secondary, preemptable basis. We believe that a nationwide Band Manager will be able to effectively protect the interests of incumbent public safety users by establishing consistent, nationwide rules governing use of the band and providing new opportunities for non-public safety access to the band.52 44 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15042-43, para. 27. 45 Id. at 15048, para. 44. 46 Id. at 15050, para. 51. 47 Id. 48 Id. at 15050-51, paras. 51-53. 49 Id. at 15050, para. 52. 50 SBC Jan. 10, 2022, Reply at 4-6. 51 PSSA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5-6, 9, 11 stating . . . the most-effective way to maximize the utilization of the 4.9 GHz band is to create a nationwide license and authorize a nationwide band manager to implement and enforce priority and preemption rights for public safety, and to permit use of the band for 5G public safety services, while also allowing secondary use of the spectrum on a noninterfering and pre-emptible basis see also IAFC Dec. 20, 2021, Reply at 4 agreeing with the PSSA that a nationwide band manager would be the most efficient way to ensure consistency throughout the country, adding that a nationwide band manager would implement and enforce priority and preemption rights for public safety and allow secondary use of the spectrum on a noninterfering and preemptive basis. Neil Horden Jan. 18, 2022, Ex Parte at 2 Only the establishment of a national strategy and national coordination, licensing, and leasing can maximize the use and utility of the spectrum. Letter from American Petroleum Institute, et al, to Marlene H. Dortch, WP Docket No. 07-100, at 2 filed Aug. 25, 2022 API et al. Aug. 25, 2022, Ex Parte supporting the implementation of a band manager-like entity that would be responsible for the development of a 4.9 GHz spectrum band utilization strategy and policies. 52 See IACP Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 IAFC Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 5-6 The band manager must also be empowered to clear 4.9 GHz spectrum of secondary users when public safety users need the band for local, continued. 711 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 We also believe this approach will spur innovation and drive down costs while ensuring full protection for authorized public safety operations.53 Crucially, the Band Manager will ensure that local governments can continue to use the band to suit their unique spectrum needs, while promoting the most efficient use of spectrum and creating a consistent and clear band framework nationwide. We therefore find that designating a nationwide Band Manager to coordinate public safety access and facilitate the introduction of non-public safety services to the band will best serve the public interest. 1. Selecting the Band Manager 21. In the Eighth Further Notice, we sought comment on the process for accepting applications and selecting the entity that will manage leasing to non-public safety entities.54 We also sought comment on the criteria to be used to certify coordinators of public safety operations in the band.55 Based on past Commission experience, we find that it is in the public interest for the Band Manager who will fill both rolesto be chosen by a selection committee that represents and ensures the involvement of the relevant stakeholders, in particular the public safety community. The Commission has successfully used similar selection committees in other proceedings, such as the 700 MHz and 800 MHz proceedings,56 and most recently in the 3.7 GHz57 and 3.45 GHz58 clearinghouse selections, to enable interested parties to choose who can most effectively manage complex coordination efforts. In the 3.7 GHz proceeding, for example, the Commission used a selection committee to evaluate and choose the 3.7 GHz relocation clearinghouse, the entity responsible for the multi-billion dollar relocation reimbursement process, which is an essential component of transitioning that critical mid-band spectrum to enable new wireless operations.59 A similar process is underway in the 3.45 GHz band.60 These selection committees have successfully incorporated feedback from relevant stakeholders to facilitate the choice of well- qualified clearinghouse candidates in the aforementioned bands. We believe using a selection committee in the 4.9 GHz band will similarly enable the efficient use of mid-band spectrum here, while ensuring that the Band Manager is representative of and fully supported by the public safety community. 22. A stakeholder-led process will be particularly useful for the selection of the Band Manager in the instant case, because the Band Managers connections with the public safety community will form the backbone of its work. The trust and understanding of the public safety community, as well as its voluntary cooperation with and buy-in to the Band Managers mission, will be essential to achieving regional, or even nationwide incidents. PSSA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 2 As the PSSA previously stated, a nationwide license is the most effective way to maximize the utilization of the 4.9 GHz Band, and the most efficient way to ensure that public safety users enjoy priority and preemption.

The selection committee, which will be named by the Commission, will choose from a pool of qualified applicants, and as in prior cases, the final selection will be subject to a finding by the Commission that the selection satisfies the criteria established by the selection committee. While we seek comment on the rights and responsibilities of the Band Managerwhich will form the basis for the committees selection criteriathe composition of the selection committee, and other process details in the Ninth Further Notice, we find that utilizing a selection committee will ensure that the Band Manager, once chosen, will adequately represent the public safety community and foster a cooperative environment that promotes the efficient management and use of this band. We delegate to the Bureaus the authority to manage the process of determining the selection committees responsibilities, including by issuing public notices as necessary to obtain additional comment to address questions regarding the selection committee. 2. Band Manager Responsibilities 23. Once selected, the Band Manager will have three primary responsibilities 1 frequency coordination 2 incentivizing the use of the latest commercially available technologies, including 5G and 3 facilitating secondary non-public safety use. We describe each responsibility below, and seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice on questions related to the implementation of these provisions, as well as the Commissions role in ensuring the Band Manager can achieve these goals. 24. Frequency Coordination. In the Eighth Further Notice, we sought comment on whether frequency coordination should be incorporated into management of the band to support efficient and interference-free access for public safety operations.61 Based on record support, we assign to the Band Manager responsibility for performing the frequency coordination function for public safety applicants seeking to license new or modify existing facilities in the band, thus ensuring the efficient assignment and use of spectrum by public safety licensees.62 As discussed below,63 the Band Manager will perform its frequency coordination duties consistent with the Commissions rules, once adopted,64 and with input from public safety licensees and applicants to ensure that they are able to access sufficient spectrum for their operations. In doing so, the Band Manager will advise and help public safety licensees and applicants to design their deployments in order to promote efficient and robust use of the band and prevent harmful interference to other licensees. The Band Manager will not, however, have the authority to disallow proposed public safety operations or otherwise limit public safety operations once a public safety entity is licensed to operate in the band. Instead, the Band Manager will provide public safety licensees and applicants with recommendations for the technical characteristics of a proposed system, subject to Commission review in the case of any objections to such recommendations. While the Band 61 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15043, 15048-50, paras. 30, 45-50. 62 See PSSA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 9-10 stating that a band manager should develop a spectrum plan for the use of 5G across the contiguous 50 MHz of spectrum and be responsible for developing a sustainable business model for usage of the band that would optimize such use IAFC Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 5 stating that the Commission should designate a single nationwide band manager that would be responsible for developing a nationwide framework for the 4.9 GHz band Caltrans Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 5 Caltrans proposes that primary tasks for a nationwide band manager include . . .

We recognize that the success of this framework will depend in part on public safety licensees cooperation and responsible use of spectrum, and given the history of collaboration within this community we anticipate few, if any, issues. 25. Technological Incentivization. The Eighth Further Notice also sought comment on commercial 5G offerings available to public safety, and on any public safety use cases supported by 5G and other advanced technologies.65 The Commission further raised the potential for the 4.9 GHz band to support applications enabled by 5G technology, but it expressed a strong preference to adhere to a technology-neutral policy for the band and strive for operational flexibility.66 26. In response, several commenters supported the deployment and integration of commercially available technologies such as 5G in the 4.9 GHz band,67 with some commenters stating that frequency coordination and facilitation by a Band Manager may be necessary if advanced technologies are introduced into the band.68 For instance, NPSTC asserted that advanced technologies, such as 5G, must be deployed in such a way that supports continued public safety operations.69 27. Based on the comments before us, we conclude that the Band Manger should use its background and expertise to determine and recommend, as part of a spectrum plan for the band and for the benefit of any interested licensees and lessees, how best to incorporate the latest commercially available technologies, including 5G, into the 4.9 GHz band in a manner that supports and protects public safety operations. We decline to mandate the use of such technologies in the band, as we agree that this more restrictive approach could limit the use of certain equipment by incumbent licensees.70 In keeping 65 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15052, para. 57. 66 Id. at 15052-53, paras. 58-59. 67 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 16-17 IACP Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 4 the full 50 MHz of 4.9 GHz is best suited for 5G deployment and, if so, aligns with the ability to pass public presented 5G data to first responders in the field PSSA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5 PSSA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 3 IAFC Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 6 IAFC Dec. 20, 2021, Reply at 4-5 stating that IAFC agrees with NPSTC that it is enthusiastic about the potential use of 5G technology to serve public safety needs and agrees with PSSA that 4.9 GHz band is well-suited for emerging technologies, including 5G. 68 See STARNet Nov. 24, 2021, Comments at 3 Joint Filers Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 4 PSSA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 3 stating the most effective way to accelerate the deployment of 5G technologies in the 4.9 GHz Band is through a nationwide licensee and the appointment of a band manager by such licensee to develop a spectrum plan for the use of 5G across the band, which would facilitate widespread deployment and interoperability, and lower equipment costs PSSA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 9 IAFC Dec. 20, 2021, Reply at 5 concurring with PSSA. 69 NPSTC Comments at 16 5G technology must be deployed in a way needed to serve the public safety community with the requisite capacity, reliability, real coverage, backup power provisions, operational features, rugged devices and specialized applications required.

We also seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice below on ways to further encourage the deployment of the latest commercially available technologies below in the Ninth Further Notice.71 28. Facilitating Non-Public Safety Access. While the Commission emphasized the importance of public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band in the Eighth Further Notice, we also recognized that introducing non-public safety operations in the band may help foster innovation and drive down equipment costs, thereby making more intensive public safety use of the spectrum a possibility.72 To that end, we sought comment on expanding use of the band to non-public safety entities, subject to appropriate safeguards to protect public safety operations.73 In response, various commenters supported introducing non-public safety users into the band, asserting that this could foster a virtuous cycle of reduced costs,74 create opportunities for incumbents and new entrants alike, and encourage equipment manufacturers to innovate and develop an expanded device ecosystem.75 Commenters cautioned, however, that public safety operations must be protected from harmful interference if the band is opened to non-public safety use.76 29. Today, we adopt new rules to allow limited non-public safety access to the 4.9 GHz band, on a secondary basis to, and subject to preemption by, public safety licensees, which will remain the primary users of the band. This expanded access for non-public safety entities will rely on a Band Manager-facilitated spectrum leasing framework premised on the Band Managers analysis of where, when, and at what frequencies non-public safety operations can take place without impacting public safety operations. The Band Manager will identify, based on consultation with relevant public safety licensees and its own expertise, situations where there are unused spectrum access opportunities. This cooperative process will enable the Band Manager to take advantage of both its expertise on 4.9 GHz band public safety operations and its extensive links with the public safety community to identify spectrum access opportunities potentially available to non-public safety entities with flexibility to permit regional variation and maximize spectrum use, but also enough consistency to ensure full protection for current and future public safety operations. We believe this approach strikes the proper balance between allowing localized control of public safety operations and reducing interference, while also ensuring that consistent, nationwide rules will promote overall spectral efficiency, foster innovation, and drive down equipment costs.77 We elaborate further on this approach below in this Seventh Report and Order, and seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice on the details of implementing the Band Manager facilitated 71 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 14 TDD Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 FPL Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 2-5 IAFC Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 6-7 concurring with NPSTC PSSA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 3, 6 see also 3GPP, https3gpp.org last visited Jan. 10, 2023. 72 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15054-55, paras. 61-65. 73 Id. 74 T-Mobile Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 3-4. 75 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 7. 76 WISPA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 17-19 APCO Comments at 7 STARNet Nov. 24, 2021, Comments at 9-10 Seybold Dec. 22, 2021, Reply at 2. 77 See PSSA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 8 stating that a nationwide licensee would facilitate nationwide network deployment, thereby accelerating the availability of the 4.9 GHz Band for 5G services and reducing equipment costs and agreeing with the Commission that a nationwide approach to the band will promote a robust equipment market, drive down prices and costs, spur innovation, and increase the likelihood of interoperable communications and consistent interference protection PSSA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 2 stating a nationwide licensee is also the most effective way to facilitate the Commissions other goals regarding the 4.9 GHz Band, including nationwide network deployment, interoperability, and reduced equipment costs. 715 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 non-public safety leasing model to achieve these goals. C. Licensing Database 30. The Commission sought comment in the Eighth Further Notice on collecting more granular data on 4.9 GHz operations in a licensing database and combining that data with a formal coordination structure to improve interference mitigation efforts and bolster public safety confidence in the band.78 We also sought comment on whether to continue using the Universal Licensing System ULS or transition to a third-party licensing database to accommodate additional information.79 31. Commenting parties overwhelmingly supported the collection of more granular data on public safety operations.80 In particular, filers supported the collection of complete microwave path data for fixed links and site-by-site data on base stations currently licensed under the geographic licensing scheme as proposed in the Eighth Further Notice.81 Commenters also universally supported keeping ULS over transitioning to a third-party database.82 For example, EWA stated that there is no need to look beyond the FCCs own ULS and argued there is no rationale to support the introduction of a third- party managed database that would replicate capabilities already available in ULS.83 Commenting parties also explained that transitioning to a third-party database would result in added delays and additional costs for licensees.84 78 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15044, para. 32. 79 Id. 80 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 6-7 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 4 AASHTO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 Caltrans Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 4 IACP Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 2 IAFC Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 3-4 Region 20 Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 Maryland et al.

But see API et al. Aug. 25, 2022, Ex Parte at 2 proposing that FCC- certified Frequency Advisory Committees assist the Commission with the development of a 4.9 GHz database by securing information about current 4.9 GHz utilization and, thereafter, through the registrationlicensing process. 83 EWA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 7-8. 84 AASHTO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 stating the use of a third-party database may require a learning process and have significant additional costs to the 4.9 GHz spectrum users with large jurisdictions Caltrans Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 4 mirroring AASHTO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments EWA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 8 indicating that a third-party database alternative would increase costs and complexity without providing any apparent benefit. 716 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 32. Finally, commenters overwhelmingly supported at least a one-year period for incumbent licensees to submit the necessary technical details into ULS.85 For instance, NPSTC said it would prefer a shorter deadline but believes many licensees with extensive deployments in the band may not already have full geographic or technical information at its fingertips and may need to determine that information for numerous facilities.86 BART estimated it will need at least eight hours per site to collect the necessary information from the hundreds of fixed sites in its 131.4 mile network.87 Therefore, BART indicated it will need one year to eighteen months to submit the necessary data into ULS.88 33. We agree with commenting parties that collecting additional technical data on public safety operations will improve interference protection and give public safety licensees more confidence in the band without adding a significant burden on licensees or applicants.89 We further believe that having more granular technical data will help the Band Manager perform its duties and enable non-public safety use of excess capacity in the band without causing interference. As such, we adopt our proposal to collect more granular data on public safety deployments and will provide incumbent licensees a one-year period to submit the necessary technical detail. We also agree with commenting parties that ULS can be modified to collect the more granular data described above and that transitioning to a third-party database would introduce added delays and complexity.90 Therefore, we will continue using ULS as the licensing database for public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band. 34. Consequently, we direct the Bureaus to make any necessary enhancements to ULS, to obtain any necessary review under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and announce by public notice when ULS is prepared to accept the more granular data on public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band. Consistent with record support, we will require incumbent licensees and future applicants to supply complete microwave path data for fixed links, and to obtain a license for base stations currently authorized under the geographic license scheme on a site-by-site basis.91 We direct the Bureaus to modify ULS so that it can collect transmission data from incumbent licensees and future applicants.92 Specifically, for licensees operating permanent fixed P-P, P-M and fixed receiver stations, the Bureaus should enhance ULS to collect transmitter and receiver antenna coordinates, frequencies, polarizations, tolerance, effective isotropic radiated power, emission designator, type of modulation, antenna model, gain, antenna center line heights above ground level and ground elevation above mean sea level, path 85 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 7-8 IAFC Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 4 Maryland et al.

Licensees which fail to comply with this new requirement on the timeline specified by the Bureaus shall be subject to penalties as a violation of our rules. 35. Finally, incumbent licensees will have at least one year from the publication of this item in the Federal Register to provide the required data in ULS.94 Given the record before us, we believe one year is sufficient time to allow licensees to confirm the necessary information about their existing deployments, and that this requirement will not be unduly burdensome for licensees, which already operate and maintain these deployments.95 Nonetheless, we encourage licensees to enter their data into ULS as soon as it is available once the Bureaus announce that the ULS modifications are complete and OMB has completed its review of any new collection requirements. D. Frequency Coordination 36. The Eighth Further Notice also solicited comment on requiring formal frequency coordination in the 4.9 GHz band to support interference protection and increase public safety confidence in using the band.96 In particular, we sought input on whether mandatory frequency coordination would provide certainty and incentives for public safety to increase its use of the band,97 and if so, whether part 90 type frequency coordination, part 101 type frequency coordination, or a combination of the two would be best suited for the 4.9 GHz band.98 As detailed below, we adopt a part 90 formal frequency coordination requirement for public safety applicants seeking to license facilities in the 4.9 GHz band and assign nationwide authority to the Band Manager to perform the coordination function. 37. Commenting parties overwhelmingly supported formal frequency coordination to bolster interference protection and increase public safety confidence in using the band.99 For instance, APCO stated that frequency coordination is the most effective way to promote public safety use of the band while EWA noted that frequency coordination has been used for years in other frequency bands to promote sound spectrum management.100 Based on the record before us, we adopt formal frequency 93 API and ENTELEC oppose a polarization requirement since it believes any such requirement would be limiting or impractical. See API and ENTELEC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5-6. While we specify technical parameters for P-P, P-MP, and fixed receivers, we will not require licensees to deploy a certain type of polarization. 94 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15045-46, para. 36. The Bureaus will release a public notice announcing the deadline for submitting required data in ULS only after determining and receiving Office of Management and Budget OMB approval of the new collection requirements. 95 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 7-8 IAFC Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 4 Maryland et al.

In making this decision, we find persuasive arguments by commenting parties who believe the benefits of formal frequency outweigh any nominal costs.101 38. Although commenters were split on the type of coordination that should be applied to public safety operations in the band,102 we find that part 90 coordination with the Band Manager serving as the nationwide frequency coordinator best suits our goal of establishing a nationwide framework for coordinating access to the 4.9 GHz band. We note that part 90 coordination has for years reduced interference while promoting robust public safety operations in other frequency bands.103 In addition, by performing the frequency coordination function, the Band Manager can ensure the efficient assignment and use of spectrum by public safety licensees. Therefore, we find the part 90 frequency coordination framework with the Band Manager serving as frequency coordinator preferable to a part 101-type coordination approach whereby applicants individually coordinate proposed facilities with existing licensees and other applicants whose facilities could be affected by the new proposal.104 Furthermore, we assign the frequency coordination function solely to the Band Manager as opposed to allowing competitive coordination because we find that a single nationwide coordinator is preferable for 4.9 GHz since we are implementing a nationwide framework for use of the band in contrast to other part 90 bands where coordination is more local or regional.105 39. Under the part 90 coordination framework we adopt today, the Band Manager will review applications from public safety entities seeking to license new or modify existing facilities in the 4.9 GHz band before they are filed with the Commission. As frequency coordinator, the Band Manager, utilizing the interference criteria on which we seek comment on below,106 and the more granular data collected in 101 Caltrans Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 6 stating the nominal costs associated with frequency coordination is considerably less than the potential costs of interference mitigation, frustration, and loss of system operation as a result of interference from improperly licensed or un-coordinated systems. 102 Some commenting parties prefer part 90 coordination, others part 101 coordination and some did not specify what type of coordination they prefer. See Caltrans Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 6 suggesting that Point-to-Point applications follow the Part 101 guidelines but noting that coordination through the Part 90 process will also be required since the 4.9 GHz band supports the use of mobile units as well Cal OES Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 supporting Part 90 formal coordination by a certified frequency coordinator APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 stating that for base station and mobile use, Part 90 contour-based coordination is appropriate whereas for fixed point-to-point P-P and point-to-multipoint P-MP use, a propagation modeling approach . . . would be preferable to . . .

But see WISPA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 22 stating it believes that mandatory frequency coordination governed by a SAS is necessary to support interference protection and increase public safety confidence in using the band and will provide certainty and incentives for public safety to increase its use of the band API et al. Aug. 25, 2022, Ex Parte at 2 recommending a registrationapplication process to be used by participating FACs pursuant to the FCCs MOU. 103 EWA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 6 stating that part 90 frequency coordination by FCC-certified frequency coordinators promotes intensive use of the spectrum without compromising Public Safety operations. 104 See 47 CFR  101.103d1-2. 105 EWA Jun. 21, 2022, Ex Parte at 1 proposing that APCO serve as the nationwide frequency coordinatorband manager with responsibility for developing a 4.9 GHz regulatory framework and overseeing an orderly process for licensing with input and support from the other FCC-certified Public Safety Frequency Advisory Committees. 106 See infra paras. 75-86. 719 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 ULS,107 will perform an analysis to determine if the proposed operation would cause interference to incumbent licensees or previously filed applicants. The Band Manager may, if it so chooses, allow third parties to perform the interference analysis on its behalf. The Band Manager, however, will have sole responsibility as frequency coordinator, subject to Commission review, for informing applicants if their proposed facilities would cause interference to either an incumbent licensee or an existing applicant under the criteria we eventually adopt for the band. The Band Manager will be permitted to charge reasonable rates for its coordination services, the way other frequency coordinators do today, and we seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice below on any requirements we should put in place as to those fees.108 40. Given the Band Manager is tasked with assisting public safety applicants with designing their deployments to promote efficient use of the band while preventing harmful interference to other licensees, as described above, we assign it authority to recommend to public safety applicants during the frequency coordination process the most appropriate channels, bandwidth, operating power, area of operation if mobile or temporary fixed operation is requested, or any other technical criteria which promotes robust use of the band while minimizing interference to incumbent licensees.109 Per our part 90 rules, applicants may request that the Commission overturn a frequency coordination recommendation from the Band Manager however, any such applicant bears the burden of proof for demonstrating why the Commission should do so.110 41. As is typical under part 90 frequency coordination, we afford the Band Manager here flexibility to approve applications which cause or receive more interference than provided for by the criteria we eventually adopt for the band, if the application includes a concurrence letter from each incumbent or existing applicant that would receive higher levels of interference or a statement from the applicant accepting higher levels of interference.111 We believe providing the Band Manager flexibility to approve such applications will promote more robust use of this band, for example by allowing licensees to elect to operate in closer proximity to each other than permitted by our rules, if they believe that their systems are more resistant to interference than our interference protection criteria assume. 42. Once the Band Manager is chosen and interference protection criteria are adopted, all applications filed with the Commission via ULS which seek to license new facilities or modify existing facilities in the 4.9 GHz band must include a showing of frequency coordination by the Band Manager. Below in the Ninth Further Notice, we seek comment on interference criteria to ensure public safety licensees have efficient and interference-free access to the band. We also seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice on whether the Band Manager, as part of its frequency coordinator duties, should mediate disputes if parties disagree about existing or proposed operations. 107 See supra paras. 30-35. 108 See infra paras. 124-129. 109 FCC-certified frequency coordinators for the 1427-1432 MHz band have similar authority to recommend the most appropriate frequency, operating power and area of operation. See 47 CFR  90.175g. 110 Id.  90.175a. 111 See id.  90.187d permitting an applicant seeking to license a trunked system on frequency bands between 150 and 512 MHz to operate without monitoring its proposed frequencies provided the applicant include written consent from all affected licensees id.  90.621b5 permitting an applicant seeking to license facilities in the 800 MHz band to operate at less than the minimum required co-channel distance if the applicant includes with its application a letter of concurrence from each short-spaced incumbent id.  90.621d4 permitting an applicant seeking to license facilities in the 800 MHz band to cause contour overlap to or receive contour overlap from an incumbent operating on an adjacent channel provided it includes with its application a letter of concurrence from each incumbent that receives contour overlap or a letter of concurrence from each incumbent that causes contour overlap to the applicant. 720 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 43. Finally, we decline to adopt a more active form of frequency coordination for public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band, such as the automated frequency coordination in the 6 GHz band112 or the spectrum access system that facilitates dynamic spectrum sharing in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service CBRS.113 Given our adoption of a new Band Manager to coordinate access to the band, we find that the public interest is best served by adopting the part 90 frequency coordination framework, described above, which requires no modification of or replacement to equipment currently in use in the band and which grants to the Band Manager flexibility in working with licensees and lessees to maximize the efficient use of this spectrum. E. Permitting Non-Public Safety Use of the Band 44. Alongside our decision today to adopt a nationwide Band Manager framework for the 4.9 GHz band, we amend our rules to allow non-public safety use of the band as authorized by the Band Manager. Specifically, we remove the restriction that 4.9 GHz band operations be in support of public safety, provided that any non-public safety operations must 1 be authorized by the Band Manager and 2 fully protect114 and, where necessary, be subject to preemption by, public safety operations in the band. We believe that this will enable the Band Manager to determine where, when, and at what frequencies non-public safety operators can use the 4.9 GHz band without limiting access to the band for public safety purposes.115 We emphasize that we will not license non-public safety operators, and licensed operations will remain exclusively in support of public safety. Non-public safety operations will be required to fully protect and, when necessary, abide by preemption rules regarding the public safety operations which will retain the primary use of the band. 45. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission sought comment on a range of potential approaches to expand use of the 4.9 GHz band. In particular, the Commission asked whether it is in the public interest to open the band to non-public safety uses and, if so, under what terms.116 Many commenters who supported sharing the spectrum argued that introducing new users into the band will allow for reduced costs and encourage equipment manufacturers to innovate and develop an expanded device ecosystem.117 The Eighth Further Notice solicited input on leasing regimes that could be used to provide shared non-public safety access to the band while protecting critical public safety operations.118 Commenters representing a range of interests supported a framework that allowed for the licensing of 112 See Unlicensed Use of the 6 GHz Band Expanding Flexible Use in Mid-Band Spectrum Between 3.7 and 24 GHz, ET Docket No. 18-295 and GN Docket No. 17-183, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 35 FCC Rcd 3852, 3862-77, paras. 23-67 2020. 113 See 47 CFR part 96. 114 We seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice on the standard by which the Band Manager will ensure full protection of public safety operations under a new harmful interference standard which we will define in our rules. See infra paras. 75-83. 115 SBC Jan. 10, 2022, Reply at 5-6 stating any secondary use must be compatible with public safetys operations in the band, and must be subject to rules that prohibit such secondary use from causing interference to public safety. 116 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15054, para. 62. 117 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 7 see also T-Mobile Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 3-4 WISPA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5-9, 17-19 FPL Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5-7 noting that by allowing CII entities to obtain licenses for or lease spectrum in the 4.9 GHz band, the Commission will expand the bands user base and, by extension, increase demand for equipment that can operate in the band Federated Wireless Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 8-9 WISPA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 2-6, 15-16 stating that positions advanced by WISPA, DSA, Federated Wireless and New Americas OTI suggests that if the equipment market will expand with CII, it most certainly will expand. 118 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15055-56, paras. 66-68. 721 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 secondary rights in the band to non-public safety entities,119 and filers representing public safety agencies also generally supported these goals.120 APCO, for example, noted that sharing the band with non-public safety operations could create opportunities for incumbents and new entrants alike and encourage equipment manufacturers to innovate and develop an expanded device ecosystem.121 Similarly, non- public safety operators expressed interest in the band and noted that allowing them access will benefit not only the public interest, but also public safety users through reduced equipment costs.122 We believe this band has promise for a variety of innovative use cases, ranging from commercial wireless operations, including 5G, to fixed wireless broadband services, to private network operations, including those of critical infrastructure CII entities. Commenters supported the secondary nature of such operations, and asserted their ability to protect public safety from interference.123 46. We believe the approach we adopt today will allow local public safety entities to maintain control over their operations in the band while ensuring that non-public safety uses are subject to consistent nationwide rules that minimize the risk of interference, promote robust use, and ensure priority and preemption for public safety operations.124 We note that some public safety commenters expressed concerns about sharing with non-public safety users. These commenters focused in particular on interference concerns,125 urging the Commission to make any non-public safety operations secondary if they are permitted. We recognize the importance of protecting public safety operations from interference 119 OTI Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 6-14 arguing that enacting a tiered sharing framework in the 4.9 GHz band would both protect the interests of incumbents in the band and promote broader use of the band to further public interest goals, such as improved connectivity and economic activity FPL Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5-7 Federated Wireless Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 8-9 Cal OES Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 2 Maryland et al.

We find that we can meet our goal of promoting increased access to the 4.9 GHz band generally, in addition to promoting and protecting public safety use, by allowing non-public safety entities to lease unused spectrum from the public safety licensees through the Band Manager. This model will ensure that leased operations will be on a non-interference basis, thereby, fully protecting public safety operations and providing a mechanism to enable preemption by public safety licensees. While our action today opens the band for leased access by non-public safety operators, we seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice on how that access will be implemented and which non-public safety entities should be eligible to operate in the band.126 48. Based on our review of existing operations, there is potential for widespread use of the 4.9 GHz band by non-public safety operators without impinging on public safety access. For example, there is no statewide licensee for three states and two U.S. territories, meaning wide swaths of those areas likely host little to no 4.9 GHz band activity.127 Moreover, even where there is a statewide public safety licensee, it likely is not using the spectrum throughout the state, particularly given the bands limited propagation characteristics. We believe the Band Manager will be well-equipped to find these opportunities, based both on its expertise and experience with the band and on the new, more granular deployment data we will begin collecting in ULS, and be able to match them with the entities capable of making the best use of the band. The Band Manager will evaluate all potential non-public safety operations based on consistent technical parameters and use restrictions deemed necessary to ensure full protection of public safety operations. Allowing the Band Manager to centrally coordinate non-public safety access will promote a standardized set of rules and contractual provisions for such access, which ensure that public safety retains priority and preemption rights.128 49. Under our current rules, 4.9 GHz licensees are permitted to enter into spectrum sharing arrangements with entities that do not meet the eligibility requirements for a license, so long as those entities use the spectrum in support of public safety.129 Here, we clarify that leases to non-public safety entities will only be permitted if they are coordinated and approved by the Band Manager, subject to any requirements we adopt pursuant to the Ninth Further Notice. Public safety licensees will also continue to be able to enter directly into 4.9 GHz band sharing arrangements for public safety operations. F. Priority and Preemption for Public Safety 50. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission additionally sought comment on affording public safety licensees priority access to the 4.9 GHz band, including the ability to preempt any non- public safety operations that may be authorized in the future.130 In particular, we asked whether public safety priority and preemption should be elements of any sharing model we ultimately adopt if the Commission opens the 4.9 GHz band to non-public safety users.131 We also requested input on the types of mission-critical public safety operations that should have priority over other public safety as well as 126 See infra paras. 94-123. 127 The following statesterritories are not covered by a statewide license American Samoa, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, the Northern Mariana Islands, and South Dakota. 128 See STARNet Nov. 24, 2021, Comments at 8-9 FPL Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 1 FPL Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 5-6 EWA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 4 T-Mobile Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 1. 129 47 CFR  90.1203b see also id.  1.9020, 1.9030, and 1.9035 describing obligations for and eligibility of lessees under spectrum manager, long-term de facto transfer, and short-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing arrangements. 130 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15047, para. 39. 131 Id. at 15047, para. 41. 723 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 non-public safety operations and the technical feasibility of building priority and preemption algorithms into 4.9 GHz networks and equipment.132 51. Parties commenting on this issue strongly supported affording public safety licensees priority access to the band over non-public safety users and the ability to preempt these operations when needed.133 For example, TDD indicated that priority and preemption is an essential element of the public safety network, especially when non-public priority users are on the band.134 AASHTO, Caltrans, BART, and IAFC, who opposed sharing the band with non-public safety users, supported priority and preemption under any sharing framework.135 52. Accordingly, we will ensure public safety entities have priority access to the 4.9 GHz band through licensing on a primary basis, while non-public safety users will be permitted to operate in the band only on a secondary basis. In other words, non-public safety users, subject to coordination and facilitation by the Band Manager, will only be permitted to operate in the band in a manner which causes no interference to primary public safety licensees, and with no interference protection from public safety operations. Therefore, we conclude that by allowing non-public users to operate in the band only on a secondary basis we retain public safetys ability to access the band on a priority basis. 53. The Commission also sought comment in the Eighth Further Notice on the types of mission-critical public safety operations that should have priority over other public safety . . . operations,136 but no commenting party responded to this request. The Commission does not typically prioritize one public safety entity over another when it processes license applications under part 90.137 Therefore, we conclude that a local public safety community can adjudicate its own priority levels between public safety users since individual public safety incidents may have differing communication 132 Id. at 15047-48, paras. 42-43. 133 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 18-19 NPSTC recommends that public safety remain primary in the band, as it has been since inception. However, we recognize the role CII plays during emergencies and thus would also support CII having next priority and preemption rights over any other non-public safety use that may be permitted now or in the future.

WISPA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 20-21 SAS functions are far superior to any other shared use model in enabling near real-time priority use, providing transparency to non-public safety users and ensuring that public safety users do not interference with each other when communications are essential.

However, the establishment of local priority levels does not preclude a licensee from exercising any rights or seeking any remedy available to it under our rules. 54. Finally, although there was broad support for public safety licensees to have the ability to preempt non-public safety users, there was little detail in the record about how this would work in practice.138 Therefore, we seek comment below in the Ninth Further Notice on questions related to the Band Managers implementation of an appropriate pre-emption mechanism, including shut down procedures and possible limitations on preemption requests. G. Annual Reports 55. The Eighth Further Notice also sought comment on whether to impose reporting requirements on any Band Manager designated to manage the 4.9 GHz band139 and, if so, what those reports should address and how often they should be filed with the Commission.140 We note that band managers in other frequency bands are required to submit annual reports.141 Consequently, we adopt an annual reporting requirement that will allow the Commission to oversee the Band Manager, ensure its activities advance the Commissions stated goals for this band, and provide greater transparency, certainty, and predictability in the 4.9 GHz band. 56. The current record does not reflect input on the type of information that should be included in such reports. Therefore, below in the Ninth Further Notice, we seek comment on the type of information the Band Manager should include in its annual report to facilitate oversight and ensure transparency, certainty, and predictability in the 4.9 GHz band. H. Regional Planning Committees 57. Section 90.1211a of the current rules provides that each RPC may voluntarily submit a plan with guidelines to be used for sharing 4.9 GHz spectrum within the RPC region. The Eighth Further Notice inquired whether RPCs should play a continued or expanded role in the spectrum management framework for the 4.9 GHz band.142 In particular, we asked whether regional planning is consistent with the Commissions goal of establishing a national framework for management of the band and, if so, what resources RPCs would need to ensure that plans were filed for all regions given that only 10 of 55 RPCs voluntarily filed plans to date.143 138 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 7 stating APCO is not opposed to a sharing approach provided that public safety is guaranteed priority and preemption over other users PSSA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5-6 stating while the PSSA supports secondary use of the band for capacity not being utilized by public safety, first responders need to be able to preempt such secondary use at any time.

See 47 CFR  27.607 see also Annual Guard Band Reports, FCC Aug. 2, 2022, httpswww.fcc.govwireless bureau-divisionsmobility-division700-mhz-guard-bandsannual-guard-band-reports. 142 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15051, para. 56. 143 Id. 725 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 58. Commenting parties generally showed little enthusiasm for continuing or expanding the RPCs current role.144 Although some commenters supported a continued role for the RPCs,145 many believed a lack of funding and resources for RPCs, which are voluntary organizations, would hinder their ability to perform frequency coordination or spectrum management functions.146 For instance, NPSPTC stated that given the current economic conditions, the necessary resources required for robust regional planning of the 4.9 GHz band throughout the country simply do not exist at this time.147 Moreover, Region 20 noted the challenge RPCs would face if required to manage newer technologies such as LTE and 5G.148 We agree and decline to adopt a spectrum management role for RPCs in this band given the lack of necessary funding and resources for RPCs nationwide, lack of expertise in much of the new technology likely to be deployed in the band, and lack of consensus in the record that regional planning is consistent with our goal of establishing a nationwide framework for the band. I. Interoperability Standards 59. The Commission also sought comment in the Eighth Further Notice on whether to adopt any technical standards that would promote interoperability in the 4.9 GHz band.149 Commenting parties were split on this question. A few commenters believed the Commission should formulate and adopt technical standards to promote interoperability in the band.150 For instance, while not expressly advocating for the Commission to promulgate interoperability standards, IACP saw a need for systems operating in the 4.9 GHz band to interoperate securely and reliably with existing land mobile radio legacy networks whenever possible and practical.151 On the other hand, some commenting parties such as APCO, NPSTC, and IAFC recommended against the Commission developing interoperability standards for the band.152 NPSTC stated that the diversity of uses in the 4.9 GHz band . . . makes 144 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 7 stating that any continued or expanded role for RPCs should take into account the funding and authority limitations creating challenges today NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 9 noting that although voluntary involvement of strong and knowledgeable regional planning committees has been helpful in larger metropolitan areas the current economic conditions . . . do not exist at this time for robust regional planning throughout the country at 4.9 GHz WISPA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 22 stating there is no need to designate . . . regional planning committees to coordinate frequencies IAFC Dec. 20, 2021, Reply at 3 citing NPSTC Comments. But see Region 20 Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 4 stating that RPCs can play an advisory role in the identification and assignment of available spectrum as we do today with 700 and 800 MHz NPSPAC frequencies BART Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 8 stating it strongly supports a continued role for the reginal committees. 145 BART Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 8 stating it strongly supports a continued role for the regional committees Maryland et al. Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 10 stating band management or coordination in all other bands has been successful when Regional Planning Committees or states have been delegated management responsibilities and there is no reason that cannot hold true for 4.9 GHz. 146 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 7 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 9 IAFC Dec. 20, 2021, Reply at 3. 147 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 9. 148 Region 20 Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 4 stating that its concerns relate to newer technologies, such as 5G, which could introduce challenging issues for RPC members with which we may not be fully experienced and noting that if a new entrant to the band desires to add private LTE, or in particular, private LTE with multiple eNodeB transmitter locations, technologies with which we are unfamiliar, the challenges of frequency coordination could be more challenging. 149 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15046, para. 37. 150 TDD Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3-4 IACP Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5 STARNet Nov. 24 2021, Comments at 5 Maryland et al. Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5. 151 IACP Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5. 152 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 6 stating that the use cases for 4.9 GHz do not implicate the interoperability issues more commonly seen in bands used for land mobile radio networks NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, continued. 726 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 designating an interoperability standard impractical, and fixed links . . . do not have an interface directly with public safety personnel on the street.153 60. We agree with the latter position. While we recognize that interoperability is an integral part of the public safety communications ecosystem, the lack of technical mandates in this band has led to the development of a variety of innovative uses, some of which have no need to work directly with one another.154 Consequently, given the wide variety of uses and potential uses of the band, we believe imposing interoperability standards at this juncture could lead to fewer equipment options thereby potentially stifling innovation and contradicting our goal of reducing equipment costs.155 J. Other Technical Issues 61. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission sought comment on certain technical rule proposals from the Sixth Further Notice to increase utilization of the 4.9 GHz band.156 Below, we summarize each proposal, review the record, and set forth our decisions. 62. Channel Aggregation. The Commissions rules limit aggregation of channels in the 4.9 GHz band to 20 megahertz bandwidth.157 In the Sixth Further Notice, the Commission proposed expanding the limit to 40 megahertz because it may enable public safety access to 5G technologies.158 The majority of parties commenting on this issue supported expanding the aggregation limit with some suggesting that channel aggregation up to 50 megahertz be permitted.159 For instance, the IACP states that the full 50 MHz of 4.9 GHz is best suited for 5G deployment.160 We agree with these commenters that wider bandwidths should be permitted particularly, as commenters note, because 5G technology permits operation with a channel bandwidth up to 50 MHz.161 Therefore, we will allow channel aggregations up to 50 megahertz to provide maximum flexibility for channel licensing. Unlike with a Comments at 15 IAFC Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 4 stating generally, technologies on the 4.9 GHz band do not normally involve user-to-user or tactical applications IAFC Dec. 20, 2021, Reply at 7. 153 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 15. 154 E.g., fixed point-to-point systems and ad hoc mobile networks would not need to directly communicate with one another. 155 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 15-16 stating that the diversity of uses in the 4.9 GHz band . . . makes designating an interoperability standard impractical and that although it is enthusiastic about the potential for 5G technology to serve the public safety community it sees no evidence that 5G technology will eliminate the need for the current communications uses at 4.9 GHz, i.e., uses that will continue to be required by the public safety community APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 6 stating that the use cases for 4.9 GHz do not implicate the interoperability issues more commonly seen in bands used for land mobile radio networks BART Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 8-9 stating it applauds the Commissions strong preference to adhere to a technology-neutral policy and strive for operational flexibility and that any new technology standards should not require new investment or updates by incumbent licensees Rachel Culp et al. Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 arguing that non-public safety use of the band will result in technological innovation, equipment cost reduction IAFC Dec. 20, 2021, Reply at 7 stating that it supports 5G technology being used in the band as long as it does not interfere with other public safety uses. 156 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15053, para. 60. 157 47 CFR  90.1213a. 158 Sixth Further Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 3265, para. 10. 159 Maryland et al. Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 7 STARNet Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 6 supporting channel aggregation up to 40 MHz APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 4 IACP Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 4 supporting channel aggregation up to 50 MHz. But see API and ENTELEC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 suggesting a smaller aggregation limit of up to 15 megahertz. 160 IACP Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 4. 161 Id. 727 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 smaller aggregation limit, this expanded limit will provide licensees with increased bandwidth and throughput and may encourage the use of new innovative technologies in the band. Nonetheless, licensees and applicants should request no more bandwidth than necessary for a particular use. As noted above, the requested bandwidths among other technical parameters on all applications seeking to license new or modified facilities will be subject to frequency coordination by the Band Manager, which may recommend bandwidth limits on a case-by-case basis as necessary to protect neighboring or overlapping users and ensure efficient operation in the band. Finally, to promote economies of scale for the equipment market, the expanded limit will apply to all users however, non-public safety users will be subject to any use restrictions, including potential bandwidth restrictions, that the Band Manger deems necessary to ensure full protection of public safety operations. 63. Primary Status for Fixed Links. Currently, the rules accord primary status only to P-P and P-MP fixed links that deliver broadband traffic, while links that do not meet this criterion are secondary to other operations in the 4.9 GHz band.162 The Commission proposed to accord primary status for all P-P and P-MP links on Channels 14-18 of the band plan, including fixed links that operate with narrowband traffic.163 Maryland et al. and STARNet advocated for primary status for the entire band, not merely channels 14-18.164 Moreover, several public safety parties also supported removing the broadband requirement,165 and no filer in the latest comment window opposed extending primary status to fixed links on all channels in the band. We believe that extending primary status to P-P and P-MP fixed links that operate only on Channels 14-18 in the band, as originally proposed, may continue to limit flexibility and make the band less attractive for investment. Furthermore, we agree with those commenters that support removing the requirement that fixed links deliver broadband traffic in order to obtain primary status. Accordingly, going forward we will authorize all P-P and P-MP links throughout the band on a primary basis including those transmitting narrowband traffic. We will also permit licensees operating fixed links which are currently authorized on a secondary basis to seek to upgrade those links to primary status. Applications requesting initial authorization for primary links or upgrades from secondary status to primary status for existing links will be accepted once a Band Manager is selected and the formal frequency coordination process described above is in place. 64. Temporary P-P Operation. The Commission proposed to limit temporary P-P operation to thirty days maximum over a given path over a one-year period in order to limit temporary links to truly temporary uses.166 Maryland et al. and STARNet opposed such a limit as excessive, noting that it would potentially constrict operations during a disaster or an on-going event.167 No filer in the latest comment window supported a limit on temporary P-P operations. We agree that a limit on temporary P-P operations will limit flexibility in the band. Accordingly, we decline to adopt this proposal. 65. Antenna Gain. The Commission proposed to require a minimum antenna gain of 26 dBi for P-P antennas to enable users to deploy larger directional antennas, . . . and to produce narrower beam widths and more directional P-P links, which should enable co-channel users in congested areas to place links closer together and achieve greater frequency reuse.168 A majority of commenters opposed this 162 47 CFR  90.1207d. 163 Sixth Further Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 3278-79, para. 48. 164 Maryland et al.

Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 1, 2, 7 Fixed point-to-point and point-to multi-point 4.9 GHz paths represent the main use of the band, serve an important public safety interest, and should be afforded primary status regardless of whether they are used to deliver broadband service. STARNet Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 1-3, 6 Maryland et al. Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 1-2. 166 Sixth Further Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 3279, para. 50 citing NPSTC Oct. 24, 2013 Plan at 7. 167 Maryland et al. Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 7 STARNet Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 7. 168 Sixth Further Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 3281, para. 56. 728 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 proposal. For example, Maryland et al. and STARNet stated that they are uncertain why the Commission focuses on a minimum gain for antennas and that this seems to contradict the goals of the 8th Further Notice by immediately affecting specifications for innovative technologies.169 WISPA stated that a 26 dBi parabolic antenna would be approximately 18 inches or more in diameter, and is larger than commercially available panel antennas.170 On the other hand, API and ENTELEC recommended varying minimum antenna gains and power limits depending on link distance and whether a link serves multipoint receivers because API and ENTELEC feel that the minimum antenna gain requirements should align with the communications distance sought to maximize channel re-use.171 While power limits depending on such factors may be appropriate as a method to reduce the likelihood of interference,172 we agree with the bulk of commenters that a minimum gain requirement would introduce an unnecessary restriction. The proposed restriction would mean that commercially available antennas, which WISPA reports are smaller than a parabolic antenna with 26 dB minimum gain, would be rendered non-compliant. Thus, we believe such a limit may inhibit development of a robust and affordable equipment market for the band that leverages commercially available antennas and technologies. Accordingly, we decline to adopt the minimum antenna gain proposal. 66. Construction Deadline. The Commission proposed to require all 4.9 GHz geographic area licensees to place at least one base or temporary fixed station in operation within 12 months of license grant and to reduce the construction period for fixed P-P stations from 18 months to 12 months.173 The Commission also included P-MP stations in this proposed requirement.174 Maryland et al., STARNet, and API and ENTELEC supported these proposals.175 No filer in the latest comment window opposed this proposal. We believe that shortening the construction period to one year for all 4.9 GHz licenses will lead to more timely use of the spectrum and reduce the possibility of spectrum warehousing. Moreover, the change will harmonize the construction deadlines for the 4.9 GHz band with the deadlines of section 90.155, which is the analogous rule for the majority of part 90 radio services.176 Accordingly, taking into account that base stations will be licensed on a site-by-site basis rather than on geographic licenses as discussed above and including P-MP stations, we adopt the revised construction deadlines. 67. Robotic Use. The Commission proposed to allow robotic use in the lowest five megahertz of the band, Channels 1-5.177 TDD and API and ENTELEC supported allowing robotic 169 Maryland et al.

As such, there is little need to separate robotic operations spectrally from other uses of the band. Accordingly, we permit robotic use throughout the band on a frequency coordinated basis as approved by the Band Manager. At this time, we place no specific public safety eligibility limits on robotic use because we do not wish to constrain the Commissions options to encourage robust non-public-safety use of the band. Any future non-public safety robotic use of the band, as with other operations, would be subject to the leasing framework we seek comment on below in the Ninth Further Notice. 68. Power. The Commissions rules currently set maximum conducted output power at 33 dBm for the widest available channel bandwidth, 20 megahertz.182 The Commission tentatively concluded that maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power EIRP limits should be codified in the rules,183 and proposed maximum EIRP limits of 65.15 dBm for P-P and 55.15 dBm for P-MP links.184 API and ENTELEC recommended a maximum EIRP of 40 dBm for P-P links less than 8 kilometers 60 dBm for P-P links exceeding 8 kilometers, and 27 dBm for P-MP links.185 APCO supported allowing EIRP for fixed P-P and P-MP operations equivalent to part 101 levels,186 which sets a maximum allowable EIRP of 55 dBW 85 dBm for frequency bands near 4.9 GHz. WISPA suggested the Commission should cap the conducted power . . . as is done in the U-NII-3 band.187 69. We agree with APCO that a higher EIRP limit will encourage licensees to achieve higher broadband data rates.188 Consequently, we set the maximum EIRP limit to match the limit under Part 101 178 FPL Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 2-5 TDD Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 API and ENTELEC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 Letter from American Petroleum Institute, et al, to Marlene H.

We agree that power should be limited for shorter paths to reduce the potential for interference while still permitting sufficient power for the microwave path. Accordingly, because we are adopting the part 101 fixed power limit, we adopt the part 101 minimum path length of 17 kilometers at which maximum EIRP is permitted, and we adopt the part 101 power reduction rule for 4.9 GHz band path lengths shorter than 17 kilometers.191 The existing power limit rules remain in effect for basemobile, mobile-only, and temporary fixed operations albeit extrapolated for aggregated bandwidths larger than 20 megahertz and up to 50 megahertz.192 As with bandwidth and other technical parameters, requested power levels on all new applications and modification applications are subject to frequency coordination by the Band Manager, which may impose limits on a case-by-case basis as necessary to protect neighboring or overlapping users. The Commission also sought comment on whether emission mask M is sufficient, or whether a tighter emission mask should be imposed for high power operations.193 No party commented on high power emission masks, and we take no further action on the emission mask M at this time. K. 4.9 GHz Band Freeze 70. As the Commission directed in the Order on Reconsideration, the Bureaus amended the freeze to allow those with existing 4.9 GHz licenses to modify those licenses as permitted under the rules.194 Pending resolution of issues raised in the Ninth Further Notice below, we retain the freeze for all applicants who are not already 4.9 GHz licensees.195 The Ninth Further Notice seeks comment on a wide range of questions related to the implementation of our new Band Manager model, including the best policies as to new licensing in the band. Issuing licenses to new licensees under the existing rules while these questions remain unresolved would further complicate the spectrum environment and undermine the Band Managers flexibility to provide for efficient use of this spectrum by public safety and non-public safety operations. New entrants facing special circumstances may seek a waiver of the freeze pursuant to section 1.925 of the Commissions rules.196 189 See 47 CFR  101.113 allowing a maximum EIRP of 55 dBW for the 3,700-4,200 MHz and 5,925-6,425 MHz frequency bands. 190 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5, n.16 see also 47 CFR  101.143 setting a minimum path length of 17 kilometers in the 1,850-7,125 MHz band inclusive of the 4.9 GHz band and a power reduction formula for shorter path lengths. 191 See 47 CFR  101.143b setting a power reduction formula of EIRP  MAXEIRP - 40logAB dBW where EIRP  The new maximum EIRP equivalent isotropically radiated power in dBW MAXEIRP  Maximum EIRP as set forth in the Table in Section 101.113a A  Minimum path length from the Table above for the frequency band in kilometers and B  The actual path length in kilometers.

NINTH FURTHER NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING 71. In this Ninth Further Notice, we seek comment on a range of questions related to the implementation of our new Band Manager model for the 4.9 GHz band adopted above in the Seventh Report and Order. This model will preserve the essentially public safety nature of the band while decreasing access costs and expanding use to a variety of primary public safety and secondary non-public safety operations. 72. First, we seek comment on the Band Managers efforts in coordinating public safety operations, in particular mitigating harmful interference and modernizing operations. Next, we seek comment on the Band Managers role in facilitating leasing to non-public safety users how to enable such leasing, how to manage the revenues that arise from it, and how to ensure preemption rights for public safety operations. We also seek comment on the implementation of our committee-based selection process for the Band Manager, which mirrors the approach we have taken for selecting clearinghouses and transition coordinators in a number of other bands. Finally, we seek comment on our oversight of the Band Manager and on other issues related to the implementation of the Band Manager model. A. Rights and Responsibilities of the Nationwide Band Manager Regarding Public Safety Operations 73. We seek comment on the rights and responsibilities of the Band Manager with regards to the coordination and management of public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band. We believe that the Band Manager, which need not necessarily be a public safety entity itself, at a minimum, must be representative of all eligible licensees in the 4.9 GHz band to ensure that, in coordinating the band and enabling non-public safety access, the Band Manager is knowledgeable and its judgment is impartial.197 This representativeness, familiarity, and impartiality will help the Band Manager work with public safety licensees and non-public safety users to maximize efficient use of the 4.9 GHz band. 74. We also believe that the Band Manager must have a complete, accurate, and current knowledge of the 4.9 GHz band environment. This would mean that the Band Manager would be able to competently perform frequency coordination, understand and ensure compliance with our interference rules, and control use of the spectrum so as to facilitate protection for public safety. In addition, the Band Manager must be familiar with all applicable Commission rules, policies, and procedures, including the Seventh Report and Order and any subsequent orders adopted in this proceeding. We believe this would mean that the Band Manager should also have experience with ULS so that it can fulfill its role as a frequency coordinator for both public safety and non-public safety entities. 1. Criteria for Harmful Interference at 4.9 GHz 75. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission sought comment on how to ensure public safety licensees have efficient and interference-free access to the band.198 In particular, it sought comment on the feasibility of the TIA-10 standard199 to guard against interference between licensees deploying fixed P-P links and P-MP hubs but also asked about an appropriate standard for licensees deploying non-fixed, geographic-area operations or ad-hoc temporary operations.200 197 Since 1958, the Commission has expected entities that are fulfilling the frequency coordinator role to refrain from discriminating amongst users and to honor all requests for coordination. Frequency Coordination in the Private Land Mobile Radio Services, PR Docket No. 83-737, Report and Order, 103 FCC 2d 1093, 1101-02, para. 18 1986. 198 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15043, para. 30. 199 Telecommunications Industry Association, TIA Standard Interference Criteria for Microwave Systems TIA-10 2019, httpsdocuments.tiaonline.org1nq99bt1 TIA-10. The TIA-10 standard provides a methodology for designing and frequency coordinating fixed point-to-point microwave relay systems. 200 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15043-44, para. 31. 732 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 76. In this Ninth Further Notice, we build off the record before us and seek comment on specific criteria for protecting public safety licensees operating in the band from what we term harmful interference at 4.9 GHz.201 Caltrans proposed that, should the Commission decide to allow non-public safety use, one of the primary tasks for a nationwide Band Manager include Spectrum Protection to ensure that protection from harmful interference is strictly observed.202 We agree, and thus, tentatively conclude that the Commission will adopt interference criteria for protecting public safety operations in the band from harmful interference at 4.9 GHz and that the Band Manager will be required to apply those interference criteria, once adopted, as it manages access to the band to ensure public safety licensees have efficient and interference-free operations in the band. The interference criteria, once adopted, will be used to protect public safety incumbents from harmful interference at 4.9 GHz by other public safety licensees as well as non-public safety users in the band. We seek comment on this tentative conclusion. Below we seek comment on how to define harmful interference at 4.9 GHz. 77. Commenting parties uniformly supported the goal of protecting current and future public safety licensees from interference but differ on how to define harmful interference at 4.9 GHz and which interference protection approach is most appropriate.203 For instance, NPSTC stated that the threshold degradation approach of TIA-10 has a demonstrated track record of ensuring interference protection for point-to-point fixed links.204 TIA-10 defines threshold degradation as interference which degrades a victim receivers 10-6 bit error rate BER threshold by more than 1 dB.205 NPSTC noted, however, that TIA-10 is designed to minimize interference to fixed operations but indicates that whatever approach is ultimately adopted should protect the range of public safety operations including mobile operations from interference.206 APCO on the other hand preferred a propagation modeling approach it uses for coordinating TDMA systems in the VHF band for protecting fixed P-P and P-MP systems in the 4.9 GHz band from interference.207 APCO prefers its approach to TIA-10 because it believes it will make frequency coordination much simpler and more efficient overall.208 Furthermore, APCO said Part 90 contour-based coordination is appropriate for protecting basemobile operations in the 4.9 GHz band.209 WISPA stated that it believes the TIA-10 standard is overly restrictive and preferred a contour-based overlap approach similar to one used to protect Priority Access Licenses in the CBRS band from interference.210 78. Given the lack of consensus on a protection method, we seek further comment on how best to protect public safety licensees from harmful interference at 4.9 GHz. TIA-10, as noted above, 201 Although the term harmful interference is already defined under part 90, we seek comment on a specific definition for harmful interference which will apply only to the 4.9 GHz band and which will be used as the baseline for interference protection to public safety operations in the band. See 47 CFR  90.7 defining harmful interference as any emission, radiation, or induction which specifically degrades, obstructs, or interrupts the service provided by such stations. 202 Caltrans Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 5. 203 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 2-3 AASHTO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 10 IAFC Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 3 IACP Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 2 Region 20 Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 2 PSSA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 6 BART Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 2 Cal OES Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3. 204 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 9-10. 205 TIA-10 at 38. 206 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 9-10. 207 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comment at 3. 208 Id. 209 Id. 210 WISPA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 18. 733 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 defines digital threshold to interference TI as the difference between the desired signal power expressed in dBm when the receiver is at 10-6 BER threshold and the interfering power expressed in dBm into the victim receiver which degrades the receiver threshold by 1 dB.211 The TIA-10 standard notes that only the strength of the interfering signal I into the victim receiver must be calculated if a victim receivers desired threshold signal power T is known.212 It also notes that there are many ways of setting up the calculation, but the results should be identical if the same parameters are used.213 79. Therefore, we seek comment on whether the Commission should adopt interference criteria to protect public safety licensees in the 4.9 GHz band in terms of digital TI or some other standard? Is TI the proper metric to ensure protection of mission critical communications as NPSTC suggested?214 If so, would 1 dB of 10-6 BER threshold degradation be the proper way to provide sufficient interference protection to public safety? In other words, a public safety licensee would need to tolerate interference that degrades its receivers 10-6 BER threshold level by 1 dB but would serve to ensure protection from harmful interference at 4.9 GHz. Would these criteria for interference protection strike the right balance between allowing robust use of the band while protecting critical public safety communications or would it be more conservative than is necessary, as WISPA suggested?215 If it is too conservative, should higher levels of threshold degradation be tolerated or should a different bit error rate be used? Is establishing an approach that ensures protection from harmful interference at 4.9 GHz in terms of digital TI valid only when considering fixed sites? If so, why not apply it when considering interference to or from mobile operations? What criteria would be appropriate for mobile operations? 80. We also seek comment on the propagation modeling approach proposed by APCO.216 When performing part 90 frequency coordination involving a TDMA system operating or proposing to operate in the VHF band, APCO and other public safety frequency coordinators comprising the Public Safety Communications Council PSCC use the Longley-Rice propagation methodology to calculate the strength of an unwanted signal at the receive antenna of a system being evaluated.217 The PSCC considers an interfering signal at the receive antenna of less than 9 dBu as passing coordination, an interfering signal greater than 29 dBu as failing coordination, and any value in between as needing further evaluation.218 Could a similar methodology be used to determine harmful interference at 4.9 GHz and, if so, how would harmful interference at 4.9 GHz be defined? Would harmful interference at 4.9 GHz be defined in terms of the strength of an unwanted signal in dBu or dBm at the receive antenna of a station under consideration? If so, what unwanted signal level would be considered to cause harmful interference at 4.9 GHz? Would this methodology allow for robust use of the band while protecting critical public safety communications? Are there other propagation models besides Longley-Rice which could be used to perform interference calculations for the 4.9 GHz band? If so, what are they and how would these alternate models improve the process? Is the propagation method used by the PSCC only valid when considering the interference potential between fixed sites? If so, why can it not be applied when considering interference to or from mobile operations and what methodology might be more appropriate 211 TIA-10 at 38. 212 Id. 213 Id. 214 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 9 noting that public safety fixed links carry mission critical information and need to be protected from interference. 215 WISPA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 18. 216 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3. 217 See Letter from Farokh Latif, Chairman, Public Safety Communications Council, to Michael Wilhelm, Deputy Chief, Policy and Licensing Division, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau Jan. 22, 2013 PSCC Jan. 22, 2013 Letter. The PSCC frequency coordinators perform LongleyRice study at 50, 50, 50 time, location and probability when calculating the signal level from a proposed system. Id. at 1. 218 PSCC Jan. 22, 2013 Letter at 1-2. 734 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 for mobile operations? Commenting parties who support this propagation modeling approach should explain why it would make the frequency coordination process simpler and more efficient, as APCO claims, compared to the digital TI methodology described above.219 81. We also seek comment on contour overlap analysis as the basis for determining harmful interference at 4.9 GHz. As noted above, APCO supported contour overlap analysis for frequency coordination if basemobile operations are involved but offers no proposal for what contours should be used for determining interference protection.220 WISPA, on the other hand, suggested the -96 dBm contour of a public safety licensee should be protected against aggregate interference exceeding -80 dBm.221 Would these contour levels be appropriate for establishing interference protection in the 4.9 GHz band under a contour overlap approach? What method should be used to calculate the contours under this approach? Would using contours simplify the process for determining interference compared to the methods discussed above? Is contour overlap analysis valid only for basemobile operations or can it also be used for interference analysis of fixed sites? Is contour analysis also a valid method for determining interference when mobile-only or temporary fixed operations are concerned? Further, as discussed previously, would interference protection based on contour overlap allow for robust use of the band while protecting critical public safety communications? 82. We seek comment on whether there are alternative methods not discussed above for establishing interference protection for public safety licensees operating in the 4.9 GHz band. Further, should there be different definitions for harmful interference at 4.9 GHz based upon whether a system deploys fixed or mobile operations? If so, how would interference analysis work when considering systems deploying different operations for example, an incumbent deploying fixed facilities and an applicant seeking to license mobile operations? Would a better approach be to have one definition for harmful interference at 4.9 GHz for all deployments in the band but allow the Band Manager maximum flexibility to perform the interference analysis in any manner it sees fit provided the Band Manager uses good engineering principles with, as noted in the Seventh Report and Order, the possibility of challenging this determination to the Commission? In any case, we request that commenting parties provide us with specific proposals for protecting public safety licensees from interference and to explain the costs and benefits of those proposals. 83. Finally, we seek comment on whether the nationwide Band Manager should be responsible for establishing interference criteria for public safety operations in the band. Is this an appropriate delegation of our authority to the Band Manager? If so, what should the Commissions role be resolving a dispute regarding whether the interference criteria established by the Band Manager are appropriate or whether a particular operation exceeds the interference criteria? We seek comment on this approach. 2. Mediation 84. In the Seventh Report and Order, we adopt a part 90 formal frequency coordination requirement for public safety applicants seeking to license facilities in the 4.9 GHz band and assign nationwide authority to the Band Manager to perform the coordination function. We now seek comment on what role the Band Manager should play, as part of its frequency coordination duties, in mediating or deciding disputes if parties disagree about existing or proposed operations. 85. For instance, if the Band Manager does play a role in mediating disputes between an applicant and an incumbent licensee, we seek comment on whether we should assign authority to the Band Manager to resolve disputes when mediation is not successful, or simply instruct it to refer matters to the Commission. If the former, should the parties involved in any dispute be able to appeal the Band 219 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 3. 220 Id. 221 WISPA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 18. 735 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 Managers decision to the Commission? If the latter, should the Band Manager provide a recommended resolution when referring any unresolved dispute to the Commission? In this regard, we seek input on what process would work best if the Band Manager needs to mediate disputes between parties over technical issues such as the potential for one user to cause interference to another user. Has frequency coordination worked in other bands without the need for any formal requirement of mediation? 86. Should the Band Manager also have a role in mediating disputes outside its frequency coordination duties? For instance, should the Band Manager mediate disputes as part of its role, as discussed below, in facilitating the leasing of unused spectrum rights to non-public safety entities? If so, would the mediation procedures described above work if the Band Manager needed to mediate disputes between parties over determining the availability of excess capacity for leasing from public safety to non- public safety users? Are there any other scenarios where the Band Manager might need to meditate disputes between parties, such as over the determination of which links are afforded primary status under our rules? 3. Evaluating Potential Integration with Broadband Networks Used by Public Safety 87. PSSA suggested that the nationwide Band Manager should evaluate potential integration of the 4.9 GHz band with the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network.222 Indeed, ten years ago, the Commission sought comment on how the 4.9 GHz band could complement the 700 MHz public safety broadband network.223 Since that time, a number of commercial networks have integrated public safety operations into their broadband networks.224 Thus, we believe the time is ripe to consider this issue anew, but with a broader approach. As it identifies unused spectrum in the band, we tentatively conclude that the Band Manager should explore opportunities to lease spectrum, through the leasing models described below, to operators of broadband networks used by public safety in other frequency bands. We seek comment on our tentative conclusion. 88. We seek further comment on whether the Band Manager should be able to engage with any broadband network providers public safety andor commercial to pursue opportunities for integrating operations in the 4.9 GHz band with broadband networks used by public safety in other spectrum bands through the leasing models described below. Would the introduction of 5G technology into the 4.9 GHz band provide an opportunity for integration with public safety broadband networks in other bands? Are there other technologies that could be deployed in the 4.9 GHz band that also offer an opportunity for integration with public safety broadband networks? What benefits would flow from integrating operations in the 4.9 GHz band with public safety broadband networks? Is there existing statutory authority that would permit the integration of the 4.9 GHz band into public safety broadband networks? If not, would integrating operations in the 4.9 GHz band with broadband networks require legislative or statutory action? Finally, what requirements would ensure that the Band Manger has the appropriate incentives to pursue opportunities to integrate with public safety networks, including broadband networks, in other bands? 222 PSSA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 9. 223 Amendment of Part 90 of the Commissions Rules Implementing a Nationwide, Broadband, Interoperable Public Safety Network in the 700 MHz Band Service Rules for the 698-746, 747-762 and 777-792 MHz Bands, WP Docket No. 07-100, PS Docket No. 06-229, WT Docket No. 06-150, Fourth Report and Order and Fifth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 27 FCC Rcd 6577, 6594-95, para. 47 2012. 224 See, e.g., Verizon Unveils Public Safety Private Core, Verizon March 27, 2018, httpswww.verizon.comabout newsverizon-unveils-public-safety-private-core Weve Made a 10-Year, up to 7.7 Billon Commitment to First Responder Agencies, T-Mobile, httpswww.t-mobile.combusinessgovernmentpublic-safety last visited Jan. 10, 2023. 736 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 4. Technological Incentivization 89. In the Seventh Report and Order, we conclude that the nationwide Band Manager should, as part of a spectrum plan for the band and for the benefit of any interested licensees and lessees, determine how best to incorporate the latest commercially available technologies, including 5G, into the 4.9 GHz band. Should we require that the Band Manager file its spectrum plan for review by the Commission? In addition, should we require that the Band Manager complete the spectrum plan within a certain timeframe, such as within four to six months after the Band Manager is selected? 90. We also seek comment on how to encourage the widespread deployment of such technologies in a way that would promote interoperability while also lowering equipment costs. Should the Band Manager designate one or more preferred standards as part of this process, such as the 3GPP 5G standard, as long as the standards are not mandated and do not restrict the uses of other technologies and protocols, consistent with our preference to adhere to a technology-neutral policy?225 We seek comment on this approach. 5. Contents of Annual Reports 91. The Seventh Report and Order, adopts an annual reporting requirement that will allow the Commission to more effectively oversee the Band Manager, to ensure its activities advance the Commissions stated goals for this band, and to provide greater transparency, certainty, and predictability to the 4.9 GHz band. We now seek comment on what information should be included in those annual reports. 92. We tentatively conclude that the annual reports should include detailed descriptions of the Band Managers efforts to 1 develop a nationwide framework that maximizes use of the band 2 leverage technological advancements, including 5G 3 foster a robust equipment market and lower equipment costs and 4 address non-public safety use of the band to foster innovation and investment. We seek comment on our tentative conclusion. For instance, are these the proper topics for the Band Manager to address when reporting on the status of the band to the Commission? Is there any other information that should be included in these reports by the Band Manager? B. Rights and Responsibilities of a Nationwide Band Manager Regarding Non-Public Safety Operations 93. In the Seventh Report and Order above, we adopt rules that will permit the Band Manager to facilitate and coordinate spectrum leasing to non-public safety entities on a secondary basis. While public safety licensees will remain the primary users of the band, we find that our Band Manager coordinated leasing framework, which enables secondary access by non-public safety users subject to oversight and approval by the Band Manager, is the most efficient way to promote increased use of the 4.9 GHz band. Below, we seek comment on options for implementing this nationwide leasing program. 1. Leasing to Non-Public Safety Entities 94. The Band Manager will be responsible for coordinating public safety and non-public safety access to the band, ensuring that non-public safety use does not interfere with public safety operations, and for adopting procedures to ensure that non-public safety operations can be pre-empted by authorized public safety users as needed. We seek input on two possible means of enabling Band Manager-coordinated non-public safety leasing, as well as general considerations for creating an effective leased access model for the band, in particular, the need to ensure non-discriminatory treatment of potential lessees. Under either model, we want to ensure that all potentially affected licensees, as 225 See, e.g., PSSA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 3 stating the most effective way to accelerate the deployment of 5G technologies in the 4.9 GHz Band is through a nationwide licensee and the appointment of a band manager by such licensee to develop a spectrum plan for the use of 5G across the band, which would facilitate widespread deployment and interoperability, and lower equipment costs PSSA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 9 IAFC Dec. 20, 2021, Reply at 5 concurring with PSSA. 737 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 discussed below,226 are given the opportunity to consent to the leasing arrangements and we seek comment on this below. We also seek comment generally on the distribution of leasing revenues, and methods for ensuring that public safety users retain priority and preemption rights within the band. 95. Model 1 Band Manager as LesseeSublessor. Under Model 1, the Band Manager would lease spectrum access rights directly from public safety licensees and would, in turn, be permitted to sublease those rights to non-public safety entities. The Band Manager would be the only entity eligible to lease from public safety licensees and the only entity eligible to sublease or lease 4.9 GHz band spectrum rights to non-public safety entities the Band Manager would play the role of mandatory intermediary between public safety licensees and any non-public safety 4.9 GHz band user. The Band Manager would be responsible for seeking to obtain leases for access to spectrum rights from all public safety licensees in a given area, as discussed below, meaning the Band Manager would effectively pool all applicable non-exclusive spectrum access rights together to form, if successful, an exclusive spectrum access right which may be limited in time, frequency, or geographic area which it would then be permitted to lease to non-public safety entities. The Band Manager would be responsible for ensuring that any non-public safety operations fully comply with our rules on protection of, and preemption for, public safety operations, including by approving the specifics of lessee deployments to ensure no harmful interference is created. The Band Managers experience with the bandand its relationship with public safety licenseeswould be critical factors underlying its ability under this framework to maximize opportunities for spectrum access while avoiding negative impacts on public safety licensees. 96. We seek comment on this model, and any issues related to its implementation. In particular, we seek comment on any requirements we should place on the negotiation of leases between the Band Manager and public safety licensees. Should the Band Manager and public safety licensees have full freedom in negotiating the terms of these leasing arrangements, or should we specify certain terms which must be included, such as with preemption rights? For example, should we requireor prohibitterms which give a public safety licensee veto rights over the eventual lease entered into by the Band Manager and a non-public safety entity?227 97. Model 2 Band Manager as Lease Approver. Under Model 2, public safety licensees would be permitted to lease directly to non-public safety entities so long as those leases are coordinated through and approved by the Band Manager. All potentially affected public safety licensees that would have been required to lease their spectrum to the Band Manager under Model 1 would, under Model 2, be required to be parties to the lease to the non-public safety entity.228 98. The Band Manager would, in this instance, be responsible for reviewing and consenting to lease agreements and coordinating operations, including by approving the specifics of lessee deployments to ensure no harmful interference is created, but would not be a party to the lease. The Band Managers mandatory role would be limited to supervising and managing the leasing process, ensuring all required consents had been obtained and that the lease terms and proposed operations fully comply with our rules as to protection for, and preemption by, public safety operations. While public safety licensees would be free to engage the Band Manager as their agent in negotiating the lease, it need not be involved in lease negotiations. 99. We seek comment on this model, and on the nature and requirements of the Band Managers consent to a lease proposed by a public safety licensee or group of such licensees. Should the Band Managers consent here be limited to ensuring compliance with our rules, or should the Band 226 See infra para. 108. 227 Potential examples include the licensee does not approve of the specific sublessee selected by the Band Manager it objects to one or more terms of the lease or it has concerns about the proposed non-public safety operations. 228 Under Model 1, public safety agencies would only be a party to the lease to the Band Manager, not the sub-lease to non-public safety users. 738 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 Manager have the right to refuse its consent for other reasons? For example, if the Band Manager determines a lease would comply with all our rules, but believes an alternative non-public safety licensee is preferable because it has more experience with the band and its requirements, should the Band Manager be permitted to refuse its consent to the lease? If the Band Manager has the right to decline to consent to a lease, should the parties be able to appeal to the Commission? At a minimum, we propose that the Band Manager would not have the right to disapprove lease agreements for discriminatory reasons, and we seek comment on any appropriate reasons for which the Band Manager could refuse its consent. Once the Band Manager consents to the leasing agreement, what other responsibilities should the Band Manager have to ensure that the parties comply with the lease agreement and the Commissions rules? Is the fact that it will not be a party to the lease agreement a concern with regards to enforcement? 100. Implementation of the Models. We believe both models would move the 4.9 GHz band forward and dramatically improve the utilization of this important mid-band spectrum. In both cases, public safety licensees remain the primary users of the band and retain full control over it, with non- public safety operations limited to areas where all relevant public safety licensees voluntarily consent. Both models provide a path towards enabling meaningful non-public safety access to the band, which we believe will drive down costs for all users and help facilitate more efficient use of this public resource. 101. There are, however, potential advantages and disadvantages to each model and we seek comment on them. Our goal is to create a consistent, nationwide framework for the 4.9 GHz band that fosters efficient use of this important mid-band spectrum, but retains public safety priority and local control. To what extent do either of these models further these goals? For example, does Model 1s centralization of leasing with the Band Manager, which emphasizes nationwide consistency, potentially reduce local control by limiting a licensees right to be a party to leases with non-public safety entities? In contrast, will Model 2 lead to too much regional variation in leasing terms? Are there ways to modify each model to more effectively achieve our goals? 102. Similarly, is one model more or less accommodating of particular types of agreements? For example, shared system agreements, where a public safety entity and a non-public safety entity jointly build and operate a system, may be more feasible under Model 2, which allows the two entities to directly enter into an agreement, subject to the Band Managers consent. Are there ways we can better enable these kinds of agreements under Model 1? Are there advantages to encouraging a shared system approach? 103. While we have structured each model as a stand-alone proposal, we also seek comment on the possibility of implementing them simultaneously. Can the two models operate together, where some leases involve the Band Manager as a party but others only require its approval? What would be the result if some public safety licensees wish to lease to the Band Manager, but others wish to lease directly to a non-public safety entity? Does allowing both types of agreements present different the incentives for the Band Manager depending on whether or not it is a party to a lease? What other alternative models for leasing should we consider and why? 104. We propose that all lease arrangements with public safety and non-public safety entities in the 4.9 GHz band would be generally required to comply with our secondary markets rules,229 but seek comment on whether any specific rules should not apply to these leases. We also note that the secondary markets rules provide for a variety of leasing vehicles, each with their own regulatory requirements regarding the nature of the licensees role in the lessees operations.230 Should we limit the types of leasing arrangements that 4.9 GHz band leases may use? For example, should we limit leasing to only spectrum manager leasing arrangements,231 as opposed to permitting de facto transfer leases?232 229 See 47 CFR part 1, subpart X. 230 See id. 231 See 47 CFR  1.9020. 232 See id.  1.9030, 1.9035. 739 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 Alternatively, should we create a new leasing model specific to this band, given the unique nature of the relationships involved in this framework? We seek comment on these questions with regards to all types of 4.9 GHz band leases under both Model 1 and Model 2. 105. Required Consents. Regardless of the type of leasing structure we ultimately adopt, we propose that all potentially affected public safety licensees would be required to consent to non-public safety use. This will provide confidence to public safety licensees in the ongoing primacy of their operations specifically, but also of public safety operations generally. It will ensure that all non-public safety operations occur with the full consent of the relevant public safety licensees, making the decision to allow non-public safety operations fully voluntary. Under Model 1, this consent would take the form of a lease from the public safety licensee to the Band Manager, and under Model 2, it would instead involve being a signatory to the lease of the non-public safety entity. 106. We seek comment on this proposal, and on any alternatives to such a consent requirement. Specifically, are there hold-out concerns that would undermine the utility of leasing to rationalize and increase the efficiency of use in the band? Are there other ways of ensuring the primacy and protection of public safety use that could reduce these concerns? We seek comment on whether we should have exceptions to this general consent requirement such as after a period of non-responsiveness or if the licensee has conditioned its consent in a manner which does not conform with our rules. Similarly, should we have an exception to the general consent requirement if, as discussed below, we require certain licensees whose license area does not overlap with the lease area to consent and they do not consent but the lessee and Band Manager demonstrate full protection for their operations? 107. We also note that, in many cases, public safety licensees are subject to overlapping jurisdiction with one another, as in the case of a state public safety agency that overlaps with city and county level agencies within the state. Should the Commission take a position regarding whether each licensee makes its own, independent, decision as to a given lease? For example, states might mandate that local and county agencies consent to any lease that a state agency has consented to should we prohibit these kinds of requirements in order to preserve local control of the band in a given jurisdiction? Commenters proposing such requirements should address our authority to impose such a restriction, whether through our preemption authority or otherwise. 108. We seek comment on how the Band Manager will determine which public safety licensees are potentially affected and therefore must consentor be a partyto a given lease. To what extent can the Band Manager use ULS to determine the relevant public safety licensees? Alternatively, or in conjunction with, should the Band Manager rely solely on a licensees jurisdictional boundaries in determining the set of potentially affected public safety licensees? Under what circumstances should licensees whose license area does not overlap with the lease area be required to consent? In other words, if a lease area overlaps with the license areas of Licensees A and B, but merely abuts that of Licensee C, we propose that Licensees A and B must consent to the lease, but must Licensee C? How should we define consent rights for licensees of fixed systems, as opposed to geographic area, licenses? Must the Band Manager also obtain consent from a licensee who operates on defined channels but which will not be impacted by the proposed lease? 109. Public safety licensees may wish to modify their systems in ways that conflict with a lease agreement to which they have previously agreed. Should public safety licensees be permitted to withdraw consent while a lease is in effect for this reason? While lease and consent agreements might directly cover this question, we seek comment on whether we should address this issue in our rules. We also seek comment on whether our rules should address the ability of public safety licensees to withdraw consent to a lease, such as where they wish to lease to another non-public safety entity or to deploy a mixed-use system which conflicts with leased access. 110. We also seek comment on how to handle consents in situations where a public safety licensee, which did not previously have to consent to a lease, modifies its system in a way that alters whether its consent is required. For example, Licensees A, B, and C are the only licensees who must consent as of the date of a lease with Company Z, and all consent. During the lease, Licensee D applies 740 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 to modify its license in such a way that it now would be a required consenting party to the lease. Should the Band Manager condition its approval of Licensee Ds modification on its consent to the lease with Company Z? Or can Licensee D decline such consent? In that case, what is the impact on Company Zs lease? We seek comment below on the related questions involving new licensees in an area with existing leases.233 111. Non-Discriminatory Leasing. We seek comment on what rules we should adopt to ensure the Band Manager administers leasing in a non-discriminatory manner, and to protect against potential conflicts of interest.234 Should these rules vary depending on what the Band Managers role in leasing might be? 112. For purposes of Model 1, we seek comment on whether the Band Manager should be permitted to use the spectrum rights it leases from public safety licensees itself rather than subleasing it. Similarly, should it be permitted to lease to affiliated entities and, if so, should we have any specific obligations in such circumstances? For example, could such agreements be subject to certain conditions, such as a maximum term length or being limited to situations where no non-affiliated entity will agree to comparable terms? 113. For purposes of Model 2, we seek comment on potential limitations on the Band Managers authority to refuse consent to a given lease. Should the Band Managers authority to do so be limited to cases of non-compliance with our rules? Or can the Band Manager decline consent in favor of an alternate lessee, subject to certain conditions? 114. In the Seventh Further Notice, we sought comment on whether we should limit the types of non-public safety entities that should be eligible for leased accessfor example, only CII entities.235 Because the non-public safety access we are enabling today will be overseen by the Band Manageran entity vetted and supported by public safety licenseeswe do not believe restrictions on the type of non- public safety entities eligible for leasing are necessary. We therefore tentatively conclude we will not adopt rules in this regard, but seek comment on whether the Band Manager should have the flexibility to engage specific non-public safety users and, if so, how that potentially aligns with our rules on non- discriminatory access. 115. Finally, we seek comment on the Commissions role in enforcing these non- discrimination rules. Should we require the Band Manager to actively report to the Commission certain information about leasing, and its relationship to the parties? Or should we rely on the relevant parties to engage the Commission where concerns arise? Should there be a formal right to appeal Band Manager decisions to the Commission? We further seek comment on whether the Commission should oversee the 233 See infra para. 149. 234 See API et al. Aug. 25, 2022, Ex Parte at 2 noting the importance of promoting access to the 4.9 GHz band for all eligible parties, to be defined by the FCC on a . . . non-discriminatory basis.. 235 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15055, para. 64. Commenters were split on this question, with some supporting such a limitation as a way of ensuring that the needs of public safety operators are respected. See, e.g., TDD Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 2-3 stating the Commission should incorporate parts of NPSTCs Aug. 13, 2021 ex parte recommendations, such as opening the band to CII for internal operations of the nations utilities, petrochemical facilities, and transportation networks that increasingly are subject to cyber-attacks FPL Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5-7 supporting a sharing regime that permits non-public safety CII users to access the 4.9 GHz band and agrees with the Commission that such use should not come at the expense of public safety user. However, other commenters noted that such restrictions would limit the pool of available non-public safety operators, limiting the utility of opening the band. See, e.g., WISPA Jan. 22, 2022, Reply at 2-6 stating positions advanced by WISPA, DSA, Federated Wireless and New Americas OTI suggests that if the equipment market will expand with CII, it most certainly will expand even more if eligibility includes those potential users NPSTC and APIENTELEC seek to exclude from the band FPL Nov. 9, 2022, Ex Parte at 1. 741 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 fees charged by Band Managers and, if so, to what the nature of that oversight should be.236 For example, fees charged by spectrum access system administrators in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service must be reasonable237 should we impose a similar requirement on the Band Manager? 116. Commission Oversight. Commission oversight of the Band Manager and any leasing regime must ensure that it complies with all statutory requirements. Under either leasing model, we propose that the Commissions oversight will be based on our secondary market rules. What, if any, changes to our rules may be needed to implement this oversight model? More specifically, should the Commission review or approve each leasing arrangement? Alternatively, if the Band Manager coordinates leases, should the Commission forebear from requiring submission of leasing notifications in ULS? What, if any, changes to our rules would be required to implement this oversight model? 117. Geographic-Area License. Today, most incumbent public safety licensees hold a geographic-area license which generally covers the geographic area encompassing the legal jurisdiction of the licensee.238 Under the new licensing rules we adopt today in the Seventh Report and Order, public safety licensees may be issued site-based licenses for all operations which currently are authorized under their geographic area licenses.239 Under the newly adopted frequency coordination requirements for the band, all licensees, even those that retain a geographic area license, will be required to coordinate future deployments with the Band Manager.240 118. We seek comment on the advantages and disadvantages of allowing all incumbent licensees to retain their geographic-area licenses after they have been issued site-based licenses. Would allowing some or all licensees to retain their geographic licenses aid in the facilitation of leasing excess capacity spectrum to non-public safety users? Are there reasons to only allow certain licensees to retain their geographic-area licenses for purposes of leasing excess capacity spectrum, and if so, how should those licensees be selected? Should we require all other licensees in the band to surrender their geographic-area licenses once the licensees enter their site-based data into ULS? How would site-based- only licensees and commercial operators coordinate in areas near their operations and within their jurisdictions and thus their former geographic licensed area, but not overlapping with their site-based operations? 119. Other Leasing Issues. We seek comment on any other issues related to the implementation of this new leasing regime. What, if any, changes to our rules or to incumbent licenses would be required? Will existing 4.9 GHz licenses need to be modified? What guidelines should we implement to ensure that the Band Managers work in enabling leases and reviewing leasing applications is a fair and informed process? Should the Band Manager develop a process to provide non-public safety entities an opportunity to track the progress of their requests? 120. We also seek comment on the extent to which the Band Manager and other parties involved in leased access public safety licensees and non-public safety operators may, by agreement, streamline the process by which the Band Manager oversees non-public safety operations. For example, could the parties agree that the lessee may deploy without site-by-site approvals in a given area under certain circumstances? 236 Frequency Coordination in the Private Land Mobile Radio Services, PR Docket No. 83-737, Notice of Inquiry, FCC 83-329, 35151, para. 9 1983. 237 See 47 CFR  96.65. 238 Id.  90.1207. 239 See supra Section III.C. 240 See supra Section III.D. 742 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 121. We seek comment on how to enable leased access in areas where there is no public safety licensee.241 In these areas, should we grant the Band Manager the right to lease spectrum in those areas on its own authority? Would such authority require issuance of a license by the Commission? Or should the availability of leasing depend on a public safety entity getting a license in that geographic area? 122. In addition, notwithstanding our decision in the Order to not require interoperability between public safety users in the band, we seek comment on whether the Commission should require interoperability for non-public safety users in the band. We believe that such an approach could have multiple benefits, such as promoting more efficient use of spectrum as well as helping foster a more robust and innovative equipment market. We seek comment on those views and encourage commenters to describe any other effects such a requirement would have on consumers or stakeholders, including public safety. Are there any technical or operational challenges to adopting such a requirement? Are there any alternative approaches that the Commission should consider in lieu of mandating interoperability for non-public safety users? 123. Finally, we seek comment on whether we should distinguish between governmental agencies and nongovernmental entities which hold licenses under our rules.242 We propose that the operations of non-governmental licensees must be fully protected by secondary non-public safety operations in the band, but seek comment on whether our rules on consent to leases, preemption, and compensation should take into account the difference in status of these entities. Are there different incentives for nongovernmental licensees which justify different treatment under our leasing rules? Should we instead grant authority to consent to leases to the governmental entity which supported the licensees application? 2. Distribution of Leasing Revenues and Other Payments to Licensees 124. Funding the Band Manager. We propose that the Band Manager be funded, at least partially, by leasing revenues, which will enable the Band Manager to be fully independent and equipped to engage in the kind of complex spectrum analysis needed to enable this leasing model. This will ensure that those benefiting from the non-public safety accessnon-public safety users and their customersare the ones supporting the access system. We also believe this provides an incentive for the Band Manager to find available spectrum access opportunities wherever it can, subject to the consent of all relevant public safety licensees. 125. We seek comment on this proposal. Will the leasing revenues be sufficient to provide the Band Manager with both sufficient funds to cover its costs and a reasonable rate of return on its investment? We also seek comment on whether this model will provide sufficient start-up funding for the Band Manager, since extensive work will be required prior to any leases going into effect. Should we provide for advanced funding for the Band Manager, and if so, how? Conversely, should we place a cap on the amount of return the Band Manager can make from leases? If so, what should that cap be, and what should be done with revenues above and beyond that amount? 126. Under Model 1 above, the Band Managers role in leasing provides for a direct means by which it can fund itself using leasing revenues. On the other hand, under Model 2, because licensees make agreements directly with non-public safety lessees, there is no such direct funding source for the Band Manager. We seek comment on whether the Band Manager being funded by leasing revenues is feasible if we permit Model 2 lease arrangements. Should we require that a minimum percentage of lease revenues be allocated to the Band Manager or allow negotiations by the parties to determine the Band Managers compensation, since the Band Manager will still be required to approve all leases? If we allow 241 The following statesterritories are not covered by a statewide license American Samoa, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, the Northern Mariana Islands, and South Dakota. 242 See 47 CFR  90.523. 743 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 negotiations to cover the Band Managers funding, should the Band Manager be able to withhold its consent to a lease where the parties are not providing it with sufficient funding? 127. In the Seventh Report and Order, we determined that the Band Manager will be permitted to charge reasonable rates for its coordination services, the way other frequency coordinators do today. We seek comment on implementing this decision, specifically on any requirements we should put in place as to those fees, noting that the Band Manager, unlike most frequency coordinators, will have exclusive control over coordination services in this band. Should we limit fees charged by the Band Manager to public safety licensees and applicants? Are there other funding sources for the Band Manager that our rules should contemplate? 128. Compensation to Licensees. We also seek comment on how our rules should treat compensation to licensees, either directly from non-public safety operators or from the Band Manager. While sharing of lease revenues in Model 1, and direct payments of lease revenues in Model 2, will likely form the majority of payments to licensees, they are not the only form of compensation public safety licensees may expect. Such compensation may include, but is not limited to incentive payments to modify spectrum use by the licensee payments for consent to a lease and in-kind provision of services by a non-public safety entity, such as sharing access to a constructed network. Such compensation can incentivize public safety licensees to rationalize their operations to increase spectrum availability and to distribute the benefits of allowing non-public safety access to the band. 129. That said, we emphasize that the primary purpose of this band is to host public safety communications. We seek comment on how to ensure that lease revenue generation for public safety agencies continues to serve the public interest and our policy goals. We tentatively conclude that any public safety licensee which wholly ceases their licensed public safety operations in the band would no longer be eligible for a license and, therefore, any lease-related compensation. We seek comment on that conclusion, and on any other provisions we should consider that serve the same ends. Should we alternatively require some minimum level of continued public safety operations in order to permit leasing? 3. Preemption 130. In the Seventh Report and Order, we ensure that public safety entities will maintain primary access to the 4.9 GHz band by virtue of being the only entities licensed to operate within it, while non-public safety users will operate in the band on a secondary basis. We now seek comment on how to ensure preemption rights for public safety licensees over non-public safety users in emergency circumstances. 131. As an initial matter, we tentatively conclude that the Band Manager will be responsible for ensuring non-public safety licensees promptly comply with any preemption request, and that cooperation with preemption requests must be a material clause included in any lease agreement with non-public safety users regardless of the leasing model eventually adopted. We seek comment on this tentative conclusion, and on the role of the Band Manager in enabling preemption and ensuring preemption requests are honored. Should licensees have the ability to work directly with non-public safety users, such as when operating a shared system which has been designed to automatically shut down non-public safety operations in a preemptable situation, or should we mandate that all preemption requests flow through the Band Manager in order to ensure full compliance with our rules? 132. Further, we seek comment on what type of shut down mechanism would best enable public safety licensees to trigger preemption of a non-public safety user. Should the Band Manager be tasked with establishing a portal through which public safety entities could provide notice of preemption requests? If so, how long should the Band Manager have to initiate operational changes to impacted non- public safety users once the Band Manager receives a preemption request? What specific types of information should the Band Manager be authorized to collect from public safety entities in connection with preemption requests? Would such requests require the submission of any proprietary information or personally identifiable information, other than contact information e.g., name, address, phone number, 744 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 and email address for a point of contact at the public safety entity? Are there any privacy concerns with allowing the Band Manager to collect and maintain such information? We note that in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service, a Spectrum Access System SAS has 300 seconds to confirm suspension of operation of Citizen Broadband radio devices or relocate those devices to unoccupied frequencies once the SAS is informed that the signal of a federal system has been detected in the area.243 If the Band Manager has dynamic control over a given non-public safety operation in the band, would a similar timeframe be appropriate for a preemption request in the 4.9 GHz band? What would be an appropriate timeframe if the Band Manager does not have dynamic control over non-public safety users? Should there be some other means besides a notification portal for a public safety licensee to initiate a request to preempt non-public safety operations in a particular area? If so, how would preemption work in that case? 133. Are there non-public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band that need not be subject to preemption requests? For example, would P-P links need to be included in any preemption request involving mobile operations? Similarly, should a preemption request apply to the entire band, or should the requestor identify specific band segments that need clearing? Further, should preemption requests be limited in terms of geography such as a distance radius around a licensee and duration? If so, what distance and time duration limits would be appropriate to ensure mission critical public safety licensees have access to the band during an emergency without unduly disrupting non-public safety operation in the band? Should there also be criteria regarding what type of event justifies a preemption request? If so, should the Band Manager have discretion to decide if a particular event justifies preemption of non-public safety operations in the vicinity of that event? Should preemption requests for emergency events of a mobile or nonfixed nature, such as a vehicle pursuit, be subject to geographic and duration limits and, if so, what should those limits be? 134. Finally, we seek comment on whether only certain mission-critical public safety licensees should have the authority to request preemption of non-public safety operations. If so, who should decide which public safety agencies have preemption authority? Should the Band Manager be tasked with working with each state to determine which public safety licensees have the authority to initiate a preemption request? Alternatively, if every public safety licensee in the band has preemption authority, could that lead to excessive preemption requests making the 4.9 GHz band effectively unusable to non- public safety users? In other words, we seek comment on how to balance the need for public safety preemption versus the need to make the band attractive to non-public safety users, which we believe will be to the ultimate benefit of all users of the band. C. Selection of the Band Manager 135. In the Seventh Report and Order, we establish a nationwide Band Manager and conclude that it will be chosen from a pool of qualified applicants by a selection committee.244 Here, we seek comment on the nature of the committee and its processes, and on issues related to the creation of the committee and the Commissions role in ensuring its ultimate selection satisfies not only its criteria but also our rules. We believe the Commission has a responsibility to ensure the selection committee process is competitively neutral, and we seek comment on ways to accomplish this. 136. Selection Committee Composition. We tentatively conclude that the selection committee should include representatives from the public safety community. Should the Commission direct specific organizations to designate a representative to serve on the selection committee, like it did in the 800 MHz re-banding proceeding?245 In addition to public safety representatives, should committee members be 243 See 47 CFR  96.15a4 see also PSSA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 5 noting that the lifecycle of a life-threatening emergency, such as an active shooter incident, can be shorter than a 5-minute period. 244 See supra paras. 18-43. 245 Improving Public Safety Communications in the 800 MHz Band, WT Docket 02-55, Report and Order, 19 FCC Rcd 14969, 15070-71, para. 191 2002 800 MHz Report and Order designating Nextel Communications, Inc. continued. 745 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 representative of potential non-public safety users of the band, such as commercial spectrum users or industry associations?246 If so, which non-public safety entities are most representative of potential users, and thus, should designate a representative to serve on the committee? We note that the Commission has recently used selection committees for clearinghouses in the 3.45 GHz247 and 3.7 GHz bands.248 Should the Commission model its selection committee for the 4.9 GHz band on these committees? Alternatively, are the bandsor the nature of the entity being selected a clearinghouse as opposed to a Band Managertoo different to justify using substantially the same selection process? If so, how are the situations different and how should such differences be reflected in the selection process? 137. We tentatively conclude that the selection committee will be composed of an odd number of representatives to prevent deadlock. We seek comment on this structure, and also on the appropriate number of representatives that should serve on the selection committee. For example, the Commission chose nine entities in the 700 MHz proceeding and five entities in the 800 MHz proceeding.249 To aid in determining the appropriate selection committee size, we also seek comment on the specific number of representatives that should be designated from the different categories of entities, such as public safety and commercial users. For example, would it be sufficient to have nine members herefive representing the incumbent and public safety interests and four representing the prospective lessee and non-public safety interests? If not, what other interests or combinations of interests should be included? For example, would a selection committee composed of an even number of representatives from both public safety and non-public safety entities better represent the interests present in the band? What, if any, qualifications or experience should a member have in order to be selected? Are there any factors that would help ensure the selection committee is neutral and balanced from a competitive standpoint? 138. Selection Committee Procedures. Consistent with the 3.45 and 3.7 GHz proceedings, we tentatively conclude that the Bureaus will release a joint public notice announcing the entities that will comprise the selection committee and each selected entity would then nominate one individual to serve on the selection committee.250 We seek comment on this tentative conclusion. 139. In addition, as in the 700 MHz proceeding, we tentatively conclude that the selection committee must notify the Commission of the final process by which it will review applicants for the Band Manager position.251 The Commission also asked the search committee in the 700 MHz proceeding to ensure that the Clearinghouse meets relevant best practices and standards in its operation to ensure an effective and efficient transition.252 Consistent with this requirement, the 700 MHz band search committee submitted to the Commission a Request for Proposal and detailed instructions for filing The Association of Public Safety Communications Officials-International The Industrial Telecommunications Association Southern LINC and United Telecom Council to designate a representative. 246 In the 700 MHz proceeding, the Commission directed nine entities, which represented a mix of incumbents in the band and prospective flexible-use licensees, to designate a representative to serve on a search committee. Expanding Flexible Use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz Band, GN Docket No. 18-122, Report and Order and Order of Proposed Modification, 35 FCC Rcd 2343, 2450-52, paras. 273-283 2020 700 MHz Report and Order. In the 3.45 GHz band, the Commission asked WTB and OMD to develop a committee process like that in the 3.7 GHz proceeding. See 3.45 GHz Second Report and Order, 36 FCC Rcd at 6045, para. 163. 247 3.45 GHz Second Report and Order, 36 FCC Rcd at 6045, para. 163 3.45 GHz Search Committee PN, 36 FCC Rcd at 12700. 248 47 CFR  27.1414a1. 249 700 MHz Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 2450, para. 274 see also 800 MHz Report and Order, 19 FCC Rcd at 15070-71, para. 191. 250 3.45 GHz Search Committee PN, 36 FCC Rcd at 12700 700 MHz Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 2450-51, para. 274. 251 700 MHz Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 2451, para. 275. 252 Id. 47 CFR  27.1414a2. 746 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 proposals to demonstrate it was fulfilling its responsibilities.253 Should we impose similar requirements on the selection committee for the 4.9 GHz band? Are there other requirements that we should impose on the selection committee? For example, should we require the selection committee, once representatives are designated, to certify that they have reviewed and understand the Commissions rules and requirements in this proceeding? 140. We also tentatively conclude that the selection committee should proceed by consensus. In the event that we select an even number of committee members, or if for some other reason there is a deadlock, we tentatively conclude that the selection committee should inform the Bureaus so that the Bureaus may consider additional measures. We seek comment on these tentative conclusions. Further, we seek input on how the Bureaus should resolve the deadlock. For example, should the Bureaus state that the selection committee must proceed by majority vote? Or should the Bureaus appoint an additional selection committee member? If the Bureaus must resolve deadlock, what is the appropriate resolution timeline? 141. Commission Oversight of the Committee. We propose that applications for the position of Band Manager will be evaluated by the selection committee on the basis of the applicants ability to satisfy eligibility criteria established by the search committee, which it will devise based on the functions of the Band Manager, described above in the Seventh Report and Order and this Ninth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and any future items issued by the Commission or by the Bureaus.254 The Commission will then review the selection committees decision to confirm it satisfies those criteria and that the Band Manager will be able to perform its required functions. We seek comment on this approach. 142. We seek comment generally on what oversight role by the Bureaus is appropriate to ensure the proper performance by the selection committee. We propose the committee must provide the Commission with its selection criteria in advance of its receipt of applications for the Band Manager position so that the Commission may review those criteria and advise the committee on them as appropriate. We propose that prospective Band Managers would be asked to submit to the selection committee, in addition to their qualifications, a general description of the frequency assignment methodology they propose to employ and would also submit their proposed plan for coordinating in the band. Should the selection committee also provide copies of all Band Manager applications to the Commission for its use as part of the review of the committees processes? While we believe the selection committee will be well-equipped to evaluate applications and choose the appropriate Band Manager, we seek comment on ways the Commission can assist in and oversee that process. D. Commission Oversight 143. Beyond our oversight of the selection committee, we also seek comment on the role the Commission and Bureaus should play in overseeing the Band Managers decisions. While the Band Manager will not be a licensee of the Commission, our general authority over spectrum management forms the basis of our oversight of the Band Manager and its operations, including ensuring it fulfills its functions consistent with our rules. We therefore propose that we delegate to the Bureaus a general oversight responsibility, including the authority to address negligence, discrimination, or other errors or abuses by the Band Manager. We seek comment on this proposal, and on any other ways of ensuring that any discriminatory practices or abuses are properly mitigated andor remedied, including any penalties which might be appropriate in cases of violations of our rules. 144. We additionally seek comment on oversight of the Band Manager on the basis of performance, such as the quality and timeliness of public safety coordination and non-public safety leasing recommendations. What performance standards would be useful metrics to oversee the Band 253 Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Announces Relation Payment Clearinghouse Request for Proposal Selection Criteria, and Application Deadlines in the 3.7-4.2 GHz Band Transition, GN Docket No. 18-122, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 5768 WTB 2020. 254 As discussed above in supra para. 22, the Bureaus will have authority to manage the selection committee process. 747 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 Manager based on performance? Specifically, what performance standards should be used when it comes to timeliness, such as the speed of providing a frequency recommendation, and quality, such as recommending the best available frequency? To the extent performance standards are adopted, are there any incentives or mechanisms, such as shot clocks, that would be appropriate to ensure the Band Manager is meeting or exceeding those standards? Alternatively, should the Commission only oversee the Band Managers performance when specific complaints are submitted?255 145. We could also measure the performance of the Band Manager against any responsibilities we ultimately adopt based on those proposed above in the qualifications section. For example, where it appears that the Band Manager is not performing its duties in a manner consistent with the public interest obligations imposed in this proceeding, we tentatively conclude that the Commission or Bureaus may, on their own motion or at the public's request, conduct an inquiry into the Band Managers performance.256 While we do not foresee initiating such an inquiry on the basis of isolated complaints, we anticipate beginning an inquiry if it appears that the Band Manager has established a pattern of failing to perform in accordance with the requirements adopted here or is otherwise acting contrary to the public interest. We seek comment on the Commissions role in overseeing the performance of the Band Manager. 146. We also seek comment on whether we should impose a specific term length for the Band Managers appointment, or whether the Band Manager should instead serve until removal by the Commission. What are the advantages or disadvantages of either approach? Should a Band Manager whose term has expired be eligible to serve in that position again? If so, what type of renewal showing should the Band Manager be required to make? 147. Finally, we seek comment on the impact of a Band Manager being removed from its position, whether for cause or because of the end of its term. Should we reinstitute the selection committee to appoint a new Band Manager? What are the implications for any agreements entered into by the Band Manager in the event the entity serving in that role changes? Should we require that all such agreements specify a succession plan? E. Other Considerations 1. Future Licensing of the Band 148. Under the current freeze on applications for new licenses in the 4.9 GHz band, which we retain here pending resolution of this Ninth Further Notice, no new licensees may enter the band but incumbents may file to modify their licenses or to license new points in a fixed system.257 We seek comment on how to address future licensing of the band, given our decision to adopt a Band Manager and taking into consideration the variety of different implementation issues on which we seek comment today. 149. Should the Commission fully lift the freeze and allow any eligible public safety entity to obtain a license in the band? If so, what role should the Band Manager play in the issuance of new licenses, as opposed to simply coordinating new systems? Going forward, how could new licensees impact any existing leases, either in the form of consents or the underlying lease rights? Should new licensees be treated differently from incumbent licensees with regards to lease consent and revenue rights? Given the potential for revenue-generation from 4.9 GHz licenses under our new leasing system, are there additional buildout or other requirements we should place on new licensees to avoid spectrum warehousing? 150. Alternatively, should we instead require that new public safety deployments be under the auspices of an existing license, either an overlapping county or local jurisdiction, or pursuant to a 255 Frequency Coordination in the Private Land Mobile Radio Services, PR Docket No. 83-737, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 49 Fed. Reg. 45454, 45458, para. 23 1984. 256 Frequency Coordination in the Private Land Mobile Radio Services, PR Docket No. 83-737, Report and Order, 103 FCC 2d 1093, 1155-56, para. 127 1986. 257 See supra para. 70. 748 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 statewide license? This would enable new, locally controlled, public safety systems to be deployed, subject to our frequency coordination rules and Band Manager approval, without the creation of new licensees and new consent rights. Under this proposal, new systems would be treated as new deployments by an incumbent for purposes of protection from non-public safety operations. Is this preferable to a system of new licensure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a model? 151. Regardless of whether we permit new licenses to be issued in the 4.9 GHz band generally, we propose that the Commission would allow state entities to obtain statewide licenses where such a license does not currently exist.258 We seek comment on this tentative conclusion, and on whether there is a preferable alternative to other means of allowing access to the band where it is not currently licensed. 2. Aeronautical Mobile Use 152. The Commissions existing rules prohibit aeronautical mobile operations in the 4.9 GHz band,259 although some aeronautical operations have been approved on a case-by-case basis via waiver.260 Recognizing that aeronautical mobile transmissions pose a challenge to radio astronomy observatories RAS,261 the Commission proposed in the Sixth Further Notice in this proceeding to allow crewed aeronautical mobile use for public safety purposes, not including unmanned aircraft systems UAS, in the lowest five megahertz of the band with altitude and other technical limitations.262 Public safety parties, API and ENTLEC, FPL, and TDD supported allowing aeronautical mobile on a coordinated basis.263 CORF opposed aeronautical mobile use, including by UAS, due to potential interference problems for RAS that operate in the 4950-4990 MHz band, but specified provisions to protect observatories if the Commission allows aeronautical mobile use.264 153. Because we, through the Seventh Report and Order and Ninth Further Notice, are working to adopt a comprehensive coordination framework for public safety and non-public safety use, 258 The following statesterritories are not covered by a statewide license American Samoa, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, the Northern Mariana Islands, and South Dakota. 259 47 CFR  2.106, 90.1205c. 260 See, e.g., call signs WQCQ391 Dekalb County Police Department, WQCP515 Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of State Police, WQCQ392 Fayette County Sheriffs Office, WQDD311 Seattle Police Department, WQGX352 Westchester County Department of Public Safety, WPYU857 City of Chicago, WQCQ393 Glendale, City of, WQJE424 City of Long Beach, WQLF531 County of Los Angeles, WQNS910 Pomona Police Department. 261 Administrations should bear in mind that the radio astronomy service is extremely susceptible to interference from space and airborne transmitters. ITU Radio Regulations, Art. 29.12 2020. 262 Sixth Further Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 3266-70, paras. 12-24. 263 APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5 NPSTC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 10, 12 explaining law enforcement agencies operate helicopters and fixed wing aircraft using video cameras to help locate missing persons and to assess accident scenes and natural disasters.

Specifically, CORF supported the 5 megahertz guard band between aeronautical mobile and radio astronomy operations and the 1,500 foot altitude limit, conditioned on a 100 km exclusion zone around any observatory listed in footnotes US 385 or US161. It also supported only allowing low power devices aboard aircraft, and suggested that applicants should be required to provide a description of their operations to demonstrate that such operations will protect radio astronomy and other terrestrial uses from interference. Id. 749 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 we defer this issue and seek comment on whether the Band Manager could coordinate potential aeronautical mobile use of the band. Commenters should focus in particular on CORFs concerns about interference to radio astronomy. We seek comment on whether the Band Manager would be equipped to ensure any aeronautical mobile use fully protects these important operations, based on the criteria CORF provided in its comments.265 Should we adopt a buffer zone around radio astronomy operations such as the 100km proposal by CORF?266 Should the Band Manager be required to work with radio astronomy operators to ensure non-interference, or is it equipped to do so on its own? What sorts of requirements should be put on the Band Manager to ensure protection for RAS from any aeronautical mobile signals? 154. The Eighth Further Notice specifically excluded consideration of UAS operations from the aeronautical mobile proposal.267 We seek comment on whether the new Band Manager framework presents new opportunities for these operations in the band.268 Should we permit UAS operations in the band if we allow aeronautical mobile operations generally?269 Commenters should specifically address concerns raised by CORF and explain why any restrictions on unmanned operations would prevent harmful interference to RAS.270 3. Digital Equity and Inclusion 155. Finally, the Commission, as part of its continuing effort to advance digital equity for all,271 including people of color, persons with disabilities, persons who live in rural or Tribal areas, and others who are or have been historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality, invites comment on any equity-related considerations272 and benefits if any that may be associated with the proposals and issues discussed herein. Specifically, we seek comment on how our proposals may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, as well the scope of the Commissions relevant legal authority. 265 Id. 266 Id. 267 Sixth Further Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 3268, para. 19 stating it would be premature at this time to permit UAS, but seeking comment on the potential for the 4.9 GHz band to support possible future UAS payload operations Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15053, para. 60 seeking comment on allowing manned aeronautical mobile, not including unmanned aeronautical systems UAS. 268 See, e.g., Letter from Ari Q Fitzgerald, Counsel to Florida Power  Light Company to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WP Docket No. 07-100 Mar. 29, 2022 urging the Commission to permit UAS operations in the 4.9 GHz band. 269 The Federal Aviation Administration FAA has authority over matters of aviation safety, and is tasked by statute with the safe integration of UAS into the National Airspace System. See 49 U.S.C.  44802. Accordingly, any potential UAS operation permitted in the 4.9 GHz band would be subject to applicable FAA rules. 270 For example, it may be desirable to restrict UAS operation to specific use cases to minimize interference potential. 271 Section 1 of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended provides that the FCC regulates interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make such service available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. 47 U.S.C.  151. 272 The term equity is used here consistent with Executive Order 13985 as the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color members of religious minorities lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer LGBTQ persons persons with disabilities persons who live in rural areas and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.

PROCEDURAL MATTERS 156. Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis. This Seventh Report and Order may contain new or modified information collection requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 PRA, Public Law 104-13. All such requirements will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget OMB for review under Section 3507d of the PRA. OMB, the general public, and other Federal agencies will be invited to comment on any new or modified information collection requirements contained in this proceeding. In addition, we note that pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44 U.S.C.  3506c4, we previously sought specific comment on how the Commission might further reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees. 157. In this present document, we have assessed the effects of our creation of a new Band Manager and the collection of new granular licensing information, as well as the new technical rules for the 4.9 GHz band, and find that they will have a small impact on small governmental entities which are currently 4.9 GHz licensees, mainly related to the collection of data about existing 4.9 GHz deployments. 158. This Ninth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking may contain new or modified information collections subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.273 All such new or modified information collection requirements will be submitted to OMB for review under section 3507d of the PRA. OMB, the general public, and other federal agencies are invited to comment on any new or modified information collection requirements contained in this proceeding. In addition, pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002,274 we seek specific comment on how we might further reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.275 159. Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended RFA276 requires that an agency prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for notice and comment rulemakings, unless the agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.277 Accordingly, the Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis FRFA concerning the potential impact of the rule and policy changes adopted in the Seventh Report and Order on small entities. The FRFA is set forth in Appendix D. 160. We have also prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFA concerning the potential impact of rule and policy change proposals in the Ninth Further Notice on small entities. The IRFA is set forth in Appendix E. 161. Congressional Review Act. The Commission has determined, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, concurs, that this rule is non-major under the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C.  8042. The Commission will send a copy of the Seventh Report and Order to Congress and the Government Accountability Office pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  801a1A. 162. Ex Parte Presentations.

Add  90.1217 to subpart Y to read as follows  90.1217 4.9 GHz Band Manager. The 4.9 GHz Band Manager will have the following three primary responsibilities a Frequency coordination for public safety applications b Incentivizing the use of the latest commercially available technologies, including 5G and c Facilitating non-public safety use of the 4.9 GHz band. 760 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 APPENDIX C Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended RFA,1 an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFA was incorporated in the Eighth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Eighth FNPRM in October 2021.2 The Commission sought written public comment on the proposals in the Eighth FNPRM, including comments on the IRFA. No comments were filed addressing the IRFA. This present Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis FRFA conforms to the RFA.3 A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Final Rules 2. In the Seventh Report and Order, the Commission takes a number of actions to advance its goals for a comprehensive and integrated approach to the 4.9 GHz band which emphasizes public safety needs while spurring innovation and driving down costs in the band. As an initial matter, the Commission establishes a nationwide Band Manager which will coordinate public safety operations in the band, ensuring protection of public safety operations, and promoting more efficient use of spectrum resources while facilitating non-public safety use of the band through spectrum leasing. The Commission also adopts its proposal to collect more granular data on public safety deployments in the Commissions Universal Licensing System ULS and provide incumbent licensees a one-year period to submit the necessary technical detail. Furthermore, the Commission adopts formal frequency coordination procedures for public safety applicants seeking to license new or modify existing facilities in the band and assigns authority to the Band Manager to perform the frequency coordination function. Additionally, the Commission adopts certain technical rules it sought comment on in the Eighth Further Notice to increase use of the band while declining to adopt technical standards to promote interoperability or a spectrum management role for Regional Planning Committees RPCs. Finally, the Commission retains the freeze for all applicants who are not already 4.9 GHz licensees. Consequently, the rules we adopt in the Seventh Report and Order further our goal to maximize use of the 4.9 GHz band to support public safety while opening the door for limited non-public safety use and a more robust equipment market. B. Summary of Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments in Response to the IRFA 3. There were no comments filed that specifically addressed the proposed rules and policies presented in the IRFA. C. Response to Comments by Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration 4. Pursuant to the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which amended the RFA, the Commission is required to respond to any comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration SBA, and to provide a detailed statement of any change made to the proposed rules as a result of those comments.4 5. The Chief Counsel did not file any comments in response to the proposed rules in this proceeding. 1 See 5 U.S.C.  603.

Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rules Will Apply 6. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of, and where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities that may be affected by the rules adopted herein.5 The RFA generally defines the term small entity as having the same meaning as the terms small business, small organization, and small governmental jurisdiction.6 In addition, the term small business has the same meaning as the term small business concern under the Small Business Act.7 A small business concern is one which 1 is independently owned and operated 2 is not dominant in its field of operation and 3 satisfies any additional criteria established by the Small Business Administration SBA.8 7. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions. Our actions, over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present. We therefore describe here, at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.9 First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, according to data from the SBAs Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.10 These types of small businesses represent 99.9 of all businesses in the United States which translates to 32.5 million businesses.11 8. Next, the type of small entity described as a small organization is generally any not- for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.12 The Internal Revenue Service IRS uses a revenue benchmark of 50,000 or less to delineate its annual electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.13 Nationwide, for tax year 2020, there were approximately 447,689 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of 50,000 or less according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.14 5 See 5 U.S.C.  604a4. 6 5 U.S.C.  6016. 7 5 U.S.C.  6013 incorporating by reference the definition of small-business concern in the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C.  632. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  6013, the statutory definition of a small business applies unless an agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definitions in the Federal Register. 8 15 U.S.C.  632. 9 See 5 U.S.C.  6013-6. 10 See SBA, Office of Advocacy, Frequently Asked Questions, What is a small business?, httpscdn.advocacy.sba.govwp-contentuploads20211103093005Small-Business-FAQ-2021.pdf. Nov 2021. 11 Id. 12 5 U.S.C.  6014. 13 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C  6015 that is used to define a small governmental jurisdiction. Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small organizations in this small entity description. See Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt Organizations  Form 990-N e-Postcard, \"Who must file,\" httpswww.irs.govcharities-non-profitsannual-electronic-filing-requirement-for-small-exempt-organizations- form-990-n-e-postcard. We note that the IRS data does not provide information on whether a small exempt organization is independently owned and operated or dominant in its field. 14 See Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract EO BMF, CSV Files by Region, httpswww.irs.govcharities-non-profitsexempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf. The IRS Exempt Organization Business Master File EO BMF Extract provides information on all registered tax- exemptnon-profit organizations. The data utilized for purposes of this description was extracted from the IRS EO BMF data for businesses for the tax year 2020 with revenue less than or equal to 50,000 for Region 1-Northeast continued. 762 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 9. Finally, the small entity described as a small governmental jurisdiction is defined generally as governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.15 U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census of Governments16 indicate that there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.17 Of this number there were 36,931 general purpose governments county18, municipal and town or township19 with populations of less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments - independent school districts20 with enrollment populations of less than 50,000.21 Accordingly, based on the 2017 U.S. Census of Governments data, we estimate that at least 48,971 entities fall into the category of small governmental jurisdictions.22 10. Frequency Coordinators. Frequency coordinators are entities or organizations certified by the Commission to recommend frequencies for use by licensees in the Private Land Mobile Radio Services PLMR that will most effectively meet the applicant's needs while minimizing interference to licensees already operating within a given frequency band. Neither the Commission nor the SBA have developed a small business size standard specifically applicable to spectrum frequency coordinators. Area 58,577, Region 2-Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes Areas 175,272, and Region 3-Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast Areas 213,840 that includes the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii. This data does not include information for Puerto Rico. 15 5 U.S.C.  6015. 16 See 13 U.S.C.  161. The Census of Governments survey is conducted every five 5 years compiling data for years ending with 2 and 7. See also Census of Governments, httpswww.census.govprograms- surveyscogabout.html. 17 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Census of Governments  Organization Table 2. Local Governments by Type and State 2017 CG1700ORG02. httpswww.census.govdatatables2017econgus2017-governments.html. Local governmental jurisdictions are made up of general-purpose governments county, municipal and town or township and special purpose governments special districts and independent school districts. See also Table 2. CG1700ORG02 Table Notes_Local Governments by Type and State_2017. 18 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Census of Governments - Organization, Table 5. County Governments by Population-Size Group and State 2017 CG1700ORG05. httpswww.census.govdatatables2017econgus2017- governments.html. There were 2,105 county governments with populations less than 50,000. This category does not include subcounty municipal and township governments. 19 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Census of Governments - Organization, Table 6. Subcounty General-Purpose Governments by Population-Size Group and State 2017 CG1700ORG06. httpswww.census.govdatatables2017econgus2017-governments.html. There were 18,729 municipal and 16,097 town and township governments with populations less than 50,000. 20 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Census of Governments - Organization, Table 10. Elementary and Secondary School Systems by Enrollment-Size Group and State 2017 CG1700ORG10. httpswww.census.govdatatables2017econgus2017-governments.html. There were 12,040 independent school districts with enrollment populations less than 50,000. See also Table 4. Special-Purpose Local Governments by State Census Years 1942 to 2017 CG1700ORG04, CG1700ORG04 Table Notes_Special Purpose Local Governments by State_Census Years 1942 to 2017. 21 While the special purpose governments category also includes local special district governments, the 2017 Census of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on population size for the special purpose governments category. Therefore, only data from independent school districts is included in the special purpose governments category. 22 This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments county, municipal and town or township with populations of less than 50,000 36,931 and the number of special purpose governments - independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 12,040, from the 2017 Census of Governments - Organizations Tables 5, 6, and 10. 763 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 Business Associations23 which comprises establishments primarily engaged in promoting the business interests of their member, is the closest applicable industry with a SBA small business size standard.24 11. The SBA small business size standard for Business Associations classifies firms with annual receipts of 8 million or less as small.25 For this industry, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 14,540 firms that operated for the entire year.26 Of these firms, 11,215 had revenue of less than 5 million.27 Based on this data, the majority of firms in the Business Associations industry can be considered small. However, the Business Associations industry is very broad and does not include specific figures for firms that are engaged in frequency coordination. Thus, the Commission is unable to ascertain exactly how many of the frequency coordinators are classified as small entities under the SBA size standard. According to Commission data, there are 13 entities certified to perform frequency coordination functions under Part 90 of the Commissions rules.28 For purposes of this FRFA the Commission estimates that a majority of the 13 FCC-certified frequency coordinators are small 12. Private Land Mobile Radio Licensees. Private land mobile radio PLMR systems serve an essential role in a vast range of industrial, business, land transportation, and public safety activities. Companies of all sizes operating in all U.S. business categories use these radios. Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite 29 which encompasses business entities engaged in radiotelephone communications, is the closest industry with an SBA small business size standard applicable to these services. The SBA small size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.30 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms that operated in this industry for the entire year.31 Of this number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 23 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 813910 Business Associations, httpswww.census.govnaics?input813910year2017details813910. 24 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 813910. 25 Id. 26 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Selected Sectors Sales, Value of Shipments, or Revenue Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEREVFIRM, NAICS Code 813910, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n813910tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEREVFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 27 Id. The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of firms that meet the SBA size standard. We note that the U.S. Census Bureau withheld publication of the number of firms that operated with salesvalue of shipmentsrevenue in the individual category for less than 100,000, to avoid disclosing data for individual companies see Cell Notes for the salesvalue of shipmentsrevenue in this category. Therefore, the number of firms with revenue that meet the SBA size standard would be higher than noted herein. We also note that according to the U.S. Census Bureau glossary, the terms receipts and revenues are used interchangeably, see httpswww.census.govglossaryterm ReceiptsRevenueServices. 28 The Commissions records indicate that there are currently 13 frequency coordinators that would be affected by this rulemaking. See httpswww.fcc.govwirelessbureau-divisionsmobility-divisionindustrial-businessindustrial- business-licensingfrequency-coordinators. 29 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517312 Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517312year2017details517312. 30 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517312. 31 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEEMPFIRM, NAICS Code 517312, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517312tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEEMPFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 764 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 employees.32 Thus under the SBA size standard, the Commission estimates licensees in this industry can be considered small. 13. Based on Commission data as of December 14, 2021, there are approximately 387,370 active PLMR licenses.33 Active PLMR licenses include 3,577 licenses in the 4.9 GHz band34 19,011 licenses in the 800 MHz band35 and 2,716 licenses in the 900 MHz band.36 Since the Commission does not collect data on the number of employees for licensees providing these services, at this time we are not able to estimate the number of licensees with active licenses that would qualify as small under the SBAs small business size standard. Nevertheless, the Commission believes that a substantial number of PLMR licensees are small entities. 14. Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing radio and television broadcast and wireless communications equipment.37 Examples of products made by these establishments are transmitting and receiving antennas, cable television equipment, GPS equipment, pagers, cellular phones, mobile communications equipment, and radio and television studio and broadcasting equipment.38 The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies businesses having 1,250 employees or less as small.39 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 656 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.40 Of this number, 624 firms had fewer than 250 32 Id. The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of firms that meet the SBA size standard. 33 Based on a FCC Universal Licensing System search on December 14, 2021, httpswireless2.fcc.govUlsAppUlsSearchsearchAdvanced.jsp.

Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite. This industry comprises establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide communications via the airwaves.42 Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and wireless video services.43 The SBA size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.44 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.45 Of that number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 employees.46 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 797 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of wireless services.47 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 715 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.48 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities. E. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements for Small Entities 16. Band Manager. In the Seventh Report and Order, the Commission adopted a single, nationwide framework for the 4.9 GHz band, that is centered around a new Band Manager, which will be equipped with additional information about the current public safety use of the band and empowered to work with public safety licensees to ensure efficient use of this spectrum and enable new, non- commercial operations on a secondary, preemptable basis. Once selected, the Band Manager will have three primary responsibilities 1 frequency coordination 2 incentivizing the use of the latest commercially available technologies, including 5G and 3 facilitating secondary non-public safety use. 17. Licensing Database. In the Seventh Report and Order, the Commission adopts a requirement to collect more granular data on public safety deployments in ULS. We require small and other incumbent licensees and future applicants to supply complete microwave path data for fixed links, and to license base stations currently authorized under the geographic license scheme on a site-by-site basis. Specifically, we require applicants for and current licensees of point-to-point P-P, point-to- multipoint P-MP, and fixed receivers to provide the following information transmitter and receiver antenna coordinates, azimuth direction, polarization, beamwidth, physical dimensions, gain, and height above ground, as well as transmit details such as power, channel, bandwidth, and emissions. These requirements are consistent with existing Commission microwave radio service rules. We require 41 Id. The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of firms that meet the SBA size standard. 42 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517312 Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517312year2017details517312. 43 Id. 44 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517312. 45 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEEMPFIRM, NAICS Code 517312, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517312tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEEMPFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 46 Id. The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of firms that meet the SBA size standard. 47 Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Universal Service Monitoring Report at 26, Table 1.12 2021, httpsdocs.fcc.govpubId.licattachmentsDOC-379181A1.pdf. 48 Id. 766 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 applicants for and current licensees of basemobile operations to provide the following information coordinates base, height above average terrain base, number of units mobile, mobile area of operation, power, channels, and emissions. These requirements are consistent with existing Commission private land mobile radio service rules. 18. The Commission directed the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to make necessary enhancements to ULS and announce by public notice when ULS is prepared to accept more granular data on public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band. Incumbent licensees and future applicants seeking to license point-to-point, point-to-multi-point, and fixed receivers as well as basemobile, mobile-only or temporary fixed operations are required to use FCC Form 601. There will not be any application fees associated with this information collection for public safety entities because they are exempt from application fees pursuant to 47 CFR  1.1116b. 19. The Seventh Report and Order gives incumbent geographic licensees one year to identify and submit the necessary technical data into the ULS, including P-P links, P-MP hubs, fixed receivers, base stations, and mobiles that are not currently licensed site-by-site. We believe that collecting this data will improve the level of interference protection licensees receive in the band and will create a more predictable and transparent spectrum environment for any current and future users of the band, including potential non-public safety users. The Commission estimates the average burden for each applicant completing FCC Form 601 and associated schedules to be 1.25 hours, which includes the time to read the instructions, look through existing records, gather and maintain required data, and actually complete and review the form or response.49 20. Frequency Coordination. In the Seventh Report and Order, the Commission adopts a part 90 formal frequency coordination requirement for public safety applicants seeking to license facilities in the 4.9 GHz band and assigns nationwide authority to the Band Manager to perform the coordination function. Specifically, the Band Manager will review applications from public safety entities seeking to license facilities in the 4.9 GHz band before they are filed with the Commission. It will perform an interference analysis and recommend to applicants the most appropriate channels, bandwidth, operating power, area of operation if mobile or temporary fixed operation is requested, or any other technical criteria which promotes robust use of the band while minimizing interference to incumbent licensees. Furthermore, once a Band Manager is in place, all applications filed with the Commission via ULS which seek to license new facilities or modify existing facilities in the 4.9 GHz band must include a showing of frequency coordination by the Band Manager. Finally, we allow the Band Manager to outsource the interference analysis portion of its frequency coordination duties to third parties. 21. Non-Public Safety Use of the Band. We amended our rules in the Seventh Report and Order to allow non-public safety use of the band by small and other non-public safety operators as authorized by the Band Manager. Non-public safety operations are required to fully protect and, when necessary, abide by preemption rules regarding the public safety operations which will remain the primary use of the band. Non-public safety operators will not be licensed. Licensed operations will remain exclusively in support of public safety. Further, the Band Manager will centrally coordinate non- public safety access and will create a standardized set of rules and contractual provisions for such access by small and other non-public safety operators, which will ensure that public safety retains priority and preemption rights. F. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and Significant Alternatives Considered 22. The RFA requires an agency to provide, a description of the steps the agency has taken to minimize the significant economic impact on small entities . . . including a statement of the factual, policy, and legal reasons for selecting the alternative adopted in the final rule and why each one of the 49 See FCC Form 601 at 1, available at httpswww.fcc.govsitesdefaultfilesfcc-form-601.pdf. 767 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 other significant alternatives to the rule considered by the agency which affect the impact on small entities was rejected.50 23. The Commissions actions in the Seventh Report and Order require small and other public safety incumbents and future applicants for the 4.9 GHz band to submit more granular data on FCC Form 601, however, the economic impact will be minimized since, as noted above, there arent any application fees associated with filing this information in the ULS. We have also taken steps to minimize the burden of submitting the data by collecting the technical information on forms which licensees in the public safety community are already familiar with because they use these same forms to file license applications in other frequency bands. Furthermore, we provide small and other incumbent licensees a one-year period to submit the necessary technical details into the ULS. As we note in the Seventh Report and Order, collecting the additional technical data on public safety operations will benefit public safety licensees operating in the band because it will improve interference protection and give public safety licensees more confidence in the band without adding a significant burden on licensees or applicants to submit the data. 24. While small and other public safety applicants seeking to license facilities in the 4.9 GHz band will be subject to formal frequency coordination procedures, the economic impact will be minimized since we adopt a frequency coordination process which public safety licensees operating PLMR facilities in other frequency bands are familiar. Once in place, the formal frequency coordination process will ensure the efficient assignment and use of spectrum by public safety licensees while minimizing interference to incumbent public safety licensees. Consequently, the frequency coordination process will improve interference protection and give public safety licensees more confidence in the band without adding a significant burden on applicants. 25. The Commission considered but declined to adopt a more active form of frequency coordination for public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band, such as the automated frequency coordination in the 6 GHz band or the spectrum access system that facilitates dynamic spectrum sharing in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service CBRS. No comments were filed specifically addressing the costs associated with more active forms of frequency coordination, both in terms of setup and implementation going forward, compared to traditional part 90 frequency coordination. Thus, given the lack of record on costs associated with more active forms of frequency coordination, and the likelihood of considerable disruption to small and other incumbent licensees caused by the need to upgrade or replace all of their equipment currently in use, the Commission determined the public interest is best served by adopting the part 90 frequency coordination framework which does not require any modification of or replacement to equipment currently in use in the band 26. In the Seventh Report and Order we also declined to adopt a spectrum management role at 4.9 GHz for RPCs given the lack of necessary funding and resources for RPCs nationwide, the lack of expertise in the types of technology likely to be deployed in the band, and a lack of consensus in the record that regional planning is consistent with our goal of establishing a national framework for the band. This decision imposes zero burdens and costs and thus imposes no significant economic impact on RPCs and the NRPC, all of which we estimate to be small entities. 27. Further, we believe our decision to allow small and other non-public safety operators use of the 4.9 GHz band as detailed in the Seventh Report and Order will provide economic benefits for small entities and strikes the proper balance between allowing localized control of 4.9 GHz band operations by public safety licensees and reducing interference, while also ensuring consistent, nationwide rules that will promote overall spectral efficiency, foster innovation, and drive down equipment costs. 28. Finally, the Commission also considered but declined to 1 impose an interoperability standard in light of the wide variety of uses and potential uses of the band, imposing such standards at this juncture could lead to fewer equipment options thereby potentially stifling innovation and contradicting 50 5 U.S.C.  604a6. 768 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 our goal of reducing equipment costs 2 adopt our proposal to limit temporary P-P operations to thirty days maximum over a given path over a one-year period because such a limitation would limit flexibility in the band, and 3 adopt our proposal to require a minimum antenna gain for P-P antennas because commercially available antennas would be rendered non-compliant such a limitation could inhibit development of a robust and affordable equipment market for the band that leverages commercially available antennas and technologies. G. Report to Congress 29. The Commission will send a copy of the Seventh Report and Order and Ninth Further Notice, including this FRFA, in a report to Congress pursuant to the Congressional Review Act.51 In addition, the Commission will send a copy of the Seventh Report and Order and Ninth Further Notice, including this FRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA. A copy of the Seventh Report and Order and Ninth Further Notice, and FRFA or summaries thereof will also be published in the Federal Register.52 51 See 5 U.S.C.  801a1A. 52 See 5 U.S.C.  604b. 769 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 APPENDIX D Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended RFA,1 the Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFA of the possible significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in the Ninth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Ninth Further Notice. Written public comments are requested on this IRFA. Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for comments as specified in the Ninth Further Notice. The Commission will send a copy of the Ninth Further Notice, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration SBA.2 In addition, the Ninth Further Notice and IRFA or summaries thereof will be published in the Federal Register.3 A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules 2. Having decided in the Seventh Report and Order that a nationwide Band Manager for the 4.9 GHz band is the best option for moving forward on a comprehensive nationwide, coordinated approach to the band, in the Ninth Further Notice the Commission seeks comment on the tentative conclusions, proposals and inquiries we put forth addressing the rights and responsibilities of the nationwide Band Manager regarding public safety and non-public safety operations, selection of the Band Manager, Commission oversight of the Band Manager and other considerations involving licensing and use of the band. More specifically, we seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice on an interference criteria for the Band Manager to apply as part of its frequency coordination duties. We also seek comment on the Band Manager mediating disputes, evaluating potential integration of the 4.9 GHz band with broadband networks used by public safety in other frequency bands, and facilitating the leasing of unused spectrum rights to non-public safety entities which includes two possible leasing models that could be implemented. We further seek comment on our proposals regarding the applicable rules for leasing arrangements, the required consents for non-public safety use of the band, funding of the Band Manager primarily by leasing revenues, allowing the Band Manager to charge licensees and applicants reasonable rates for its coordination services and the eligibility criteria to be used by the selection committee in its evaluation process for Band Manager applicants. 3. Finally, we seek comment on ensuring preemption rights for public safety licensees over non-public safety users, qualifications for any entity seeking the Band Manager position, a selection committee to select the Band Manager, the role of the Commission in overseeing the Band Manager as well as the contents of annual reports from the Band Manager, on future public safety licensing of the band and on aeronautical mobile use of the band. 4. In seeking comment on these issues, we believe the Commission can implement a nationwide framework for the 4.9 GHz band which ensures public safety operations continue to be prioritized while opening the band to additional users which will facilitate increased use of the band, encourage a more robust market for equipment and greater innovation, and at the same time protect public safety users from harmful interference. B. Legal Basis 5. The proposed action is authorized pursuant to Sections 1, 4i, 4j, 4o, 301, 303b, 303g, 303r, 316, 332, and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  151, 154i, 154j, 154o, 301, 303b, 303g, 303r, 316, 332, and 403. 1 See 5 U.S.C.  603. The RFA, 5 U.S.C.  601-612, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, SBREFA Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 1996. 2 See 5 U.S.C.  603a. 3 See id. 770 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed Rules Will Apply 6. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of, and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules and policies, if adopted.4 The RFA generally defines the term small entity as having the same meaning as the terms small business, small organization, and small governmental jurisdiction.5 In addition, the term small business has the same meaning as the term small business concern under the Small Business Act.6 A small business concern is one which 1 is independently owned and operated 2 is not dominant in its field of operation and 3 satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.7 7. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions. Our actions, over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present. We therefore describe here, at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.8 First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, according to data from the Small Business Administrations SBA Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.9 These types of small businesses represent 99.9 of all businesses in the United States, which translates to 32.5 million businesses.10 8. Next, the type of small entity described as a small organization is generally any not- for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.11 The Internal Revenue Service IRS uses a revenue benchmark of 50,000 or less to delineate its annual electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.12 Nationwide, for tax year 2020, there were approximately 447,689 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of 50,000 or less according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.13 4 5 U.S.C.  603b3. 5 See id.  6016. 6 See id.  6013 incorporating by reference the definition of small-business concern in the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C.  632. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  6013, the statutory definition of a small business applies unless an agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definitions in the Federal Register. 7 15 U.S.C.  632. 8 See 5 U.S.C.  6013-6. 9 See SBA, Office of Advocacy, Frequently Asked Questions, What is a small business?, httpscdn.advocacy.sba.govwp-contentuploads20211103093005Small-Business-FAQ-2021.pdf. Nov 2021. 10 Id. 11 See 5 U.S.C.  6014. 12 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C  6015 that is used to define a small governmental jurisdiction. Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small organizations in this small entity description. See Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt Organizations  Form 990-N e-Postcard, \"Who must file,\" httpswww.irs.govcharities-non-profitsannual-electronic-filing-requirement-for-small-exempt-organizations- form-990-n-e-postcard. We note that the IRS data does not provide information on whether a small exempt organization is independently owned and operated or dominant in its field. 13 See Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract EO BMF, \"CSV Files by Region,\" httpswww.irs.govcharities-non-profitsexempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf. The IRS Exempt Organization Business Master File EO BMF Extract provides information on all registered tax- continued. 771 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 9. Finally, the small entity described as a small governmental jurisdiction is defined generally as governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.14 U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census of Governments15 indicate that there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.16 Of this number there were 36,931 general purpose governments county17, municipal and town or township18 with populations of less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments - independent school districts19 with enrollment populations of less than 50,000.20 Accordingly, based on the 2017 U.S. Census of Governments data, we estimate that at least 48,971 entities fall into the category of small governmental jurisdictions.21 10. Private Land Mobile Radio Licensees. Private land mobile radio PLMR systems serve an essential role in a vast range of industrial, business, land transportation, and public safety activities. Companies of all sizes operating in all U.S. business categories use these radios. Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite 22 which encompasses business entities engaged in exemptnon-profit organizations. The data utilized for purposes of this description was extracted from the IRS EO BMF data for businesses for the tax year 2020 with revenue less than or equal to 50,000, for Region 1-Northeast Area 58,577, Region 2-Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes Areas 175,272, and Region 3-Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast Areas 213,840 which includes the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii. This data does not include information for Puerto Rico. 14 See 5 U.S.C.  6015. 15 See 13 U.S.C.  161.

Therefore, only data from independent school districts is included in the special purpose governments category. 21 This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments county, municipal and town or township with populations of less than 50,000 36,931 and the number of special purpose governments - independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 12,040, from the 2017 Census of Governments - Organizations tbls.5, 6  10. 22 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517312 Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517312year2017details517312. 772 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 radiotelephone communications, is the closest industry with an SBA small business size standard applicable to these services. The SBA small size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.23 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms that operated in this industry for the entire year.24 Of this number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 employees.25 Thus under the SBA size standard, the Commission estimates licensees in this industry can be considered small. 11. Based on Commission data as of December 14, 2021, there are approximately 387,370 active PLMR licenses.26 Active PLMR licenses include 3,577 licenses in the 4.9 GHz band27 19,011 licenses in the 800 MHz band28 and 2,716 licenses in the 900 MHz band.29 Since the Commission does not collect data on the number of employees for licensees providing these services, at this time we are not able to estimate the number of licensees with active licenses that would qualify as small under the SBAs small business size standard. Nevertheless, the Commission believes that a substantial number of PLMR licensees are small entities. 12. Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing radio and television broadcast and wireless communications equipment.30 Examples of products made by these establishments are transmitting and receiving antennas, cable television equipment, GPS equipment, pagers, cellular phones, mobile communications equipment, and radio and television studio and 23 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517312. 24 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEEMPFIRM, NAICS Code 517312, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517312tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEEMPFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 25 Id. The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of firms that meet the SBA size standard. 26 Based on a FCC Universal Licensing System search on December 14, 2021, httpswireless2.fcc.govUlsAppUlsSearchsearchAdvanced.jsp.

Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite. This industry comprises establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide communications via the airwaves.35 Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and wireless video services.36 The SBA size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.37 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.38 Of that number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 employees.39 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 797 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of wireless services.40 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 715 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.41 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities. D. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements for Small Entities 14. The Ninth Further Notice may impose new or additional reporting or recordkeeping andor other compliance obligations on small entities, if adopted. Based on Commission proposals in the Ninth Further Notice, small and other entities are likely to be subject to the requirement that all lease arrangements between public safety and non-public safety entities in the 4.9 GHz band comply with our secondary markets rules, if our proposal is adopted. Small and other entities are also likely to be subject 31 Id. 32 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 334220. 33 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEEMPFIRM, NAICS Code 334220, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n334220tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEEMPFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 34 Id.

We also seek comment on what role, if any, public safety licensees should have in reviewing and approving lease agreements being negotiated by the Band Manager. In particular, we seek comment on the benefits and costs of different models of licensee involvement in the leasing process. Further, we seek comment whether the Commission should permit the Band Manager to limit the categories of entities eligible for leased access, or whether such limitations would be contrary to the Commissions goals of ensuring fair access and efficient use of spectrum. The resolution of each of these matters may result in additional compliance obligations for small and other entities operating in the 4.9 GHz band. 16. In assessing the cost of compliance for small entities, at this time the Commission is not in a position to determine whether, if adopted, the proposals and matters upon which we seek comment will require small entities to hire professionals to comply and cannot quantify the cost of compliance with any of the potential rule changes that may be adopted. We expect the information we received in comments including where requested, cost and benefit analyses, to help the Commission identify and evaluate relevant compliance matters for small entities, including compliance costs and other burdens that may result from the proposals and inquiries we make in the Ninth Further Notice. E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and Significant Alternatives Considered 17. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business, alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives among others 1 the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities 2 the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance or reporting requirements under the rule for such small entities 3 the use of performance, rather than design, standards and 4 an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities.42 18. Parties in the proceeding uniformly supported the goal of protecting current and future public safety licensees from interference but differ on how to define interference and which interference protection approach is most appropriate. Therefore, rather than imposing a standard on its own which could adversely impact small entities, in the Ninth Further Notice the Commission seeks further comment on specific criteria for protecting public safety licensees operating in the band from interference. Based on comments, we considered and seek comment on these alternative approaches, the threshold degradation approach of TIA-10, a propagation modeling approach used by part 90 frequency coordination for TDMA systems operating in the VHF band or contour overlap analysis as the basis for determining interference to public safety licensees operating in the 4.9 GHz band. In each case, we seek comment on whether the interference protection criteria would strike the right balance between allowing robust use of the band while protecting critical public safety communications. Further, in the Ninth Further Notice we invite the submission of other approaches and proposals with cost and benefit analyses to establish protection for public safety licensees operating in the 4.9 GHz band. 19. In the Ninth Further Notice, we also seek comment on ways to enable the Band Manager to facilitate the leasing of unused spectrum rights to non-public safety entities. We propose that all relevant public safety licensees would be required to consent to this arrangement but considered and seek comment on alternatives such as whether we should have exceptions to this general requirement and allow leasing in the absence of a given licensees consent, for example after a period of non- responsiveness or if the licensee has conditioned its consent in a manner which violates our rules on compensation. Or whether we should have an exception for lack of consent if, we require certain licensees whose license area does not overlap with the lease area to consent. 42 5 U.S.C.  604a6. 775 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3 20. To safeguard small and other entities from discriminatory treatment, we seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice on what rules should be imposed on the Band Manager to ensure it administers leasing in a non-discriminatory manner. Our inquiry for non-discriminatory leasing rules explores specific lessees as well as the types of lessees and the nature of the operations they will conduct with the 4.9 GHz band. Finally, while we propose that the Band Manager fund itself from leasing revenue, to minimize the impact for small and other entities we considered and seek comment on whether there are any requirements we should put in place as to those fees, whether we should limit the fees charged by the Band Manager to public safety licensees and applicants, whether there are other funding sources for the Band Manager that our rules should contemplate, and how to approach revenues exceeding the Band Managers costs for its services. 21. The Commission is hopeful that the comments it receives will specifically address matters impacting small entities and include data and analyses relating to these matters. Further, while the Commission believes the rules that are eventually adopted in this proceeding should benefit small entities, whether public safety licensees seeking interference protection in the band or non-public safety entities seeking access to valuable spectrum, the Commission expects to more fully consider the economic impact and alternatives for small entities following the review of comments filed in response to the Ninth Further Notice. The Commissions evaluation of this information will shape the final alternatives it considers, the final conclusions it reaches, and any final actions it ultimately takes in this proceeding to minimize any significant economic impact that may occur on small entities.

The EAS is a national system that federal, state, and local government authorities use to disseminate public warnings of impending emergencies, such as hurricanes and other dangerous weather conditions, wildfires, and child abductions AMBER alerts, over broadcast, cable, and satellite networks to consumers radios, televisions, and other audio and video devices.1 Broadcasters, cable television operators, wireless cable operators, wireline video service providers, satellite digital audio radio service providers, and direct broadcast satellite providers also are required to supply the communications capability for delivery of nationwide messages to the American public during a national emergency via the EAS.2 1 See Amendment of Part 11 of the Commissions Rules Regarding the Emergency Alert System, Report and Order, PS Docket No. 15-94, FCC 22-75, para. 3 released Sept. 30, 2022. 2 See CBS Broadcasting Inc. dba CBS Television Network, CBS Television Stations, Inc., CBS Stations Group of Texas LLC, CBS LITV LLC, Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, 34 FCC Rcd 8417, para. 1 2019 forfeiture paid CBS NAL FEMA, Emergency Alert System, httpswww.fema.govemergency- continued. 777 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-4 3. To preserve the unique purpose and effectiveness of the EAS Tones, the Commission enforces laws that prohibit their use or simulation,3 except for specific Permitted Uses.4 The Commission has warned that the use of simulated or actual EAS Tones for non-authorized purposessuch as commercial or entertainment purposescan lead to alert fatigue, whereby the public becomes desensitized to the alerts, questioning or simply disregarding whether a particular alert is intended to warn about a real, imminent threat or some other cause.5 Moreover, because the EAS Tones include operative data elements,6 the misuse of simulated or actual EAS Tones may result in false activations of the EAS that can spread false information or lock out legitimate activations of the EAS. Unauthorized use of the EAS Tones thus undermines the integrity and effectiveness of the EAS and presents a substantial threat to public safety. 4. In this Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, we find that FOX apparently willfully violated section 11.45a of the Commissions rules7 on November 28, 2021, when it transmitted or caused the transmission of EAS Tones during a FOX NFL promotional segment in the absence of any actual emergency, authorized test of the EAS, qualified PSA, or other Permitted Uses.8 The prohibition on such transmissions has been in place for many years, and the Commission has repeatedly made its requirements clear.9 Accordingly, based on our review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this Continued from previous page managerspractitionersintegrated-public-alert-warning-systempublicemergency-alert-system last visited Aug. 16, 2022. 3 A simulation of the EAS tones includes not only recordings of actual EAS codes or Attention Signals, see 47 CFR  11.31, but also sounds that mimic or are substantially similar to them, such that an average listener could reasonably mistake the sounds for an actual EAS code or Attention Signal.

II. BACKGROUND A. Legal Framework 5. Pursuant to section 503b1 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended Act, any person who is determined by the Commission to have willfully or repeatedly failed to comply with any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commission shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty.10 Section 312f1 of the Act defines willful as the conscious and deliberate commission or omission of such act, irrespective of any intent to violate the law.11 The legislative history to section 312f1 of the Act clarifies that this definition of willful applies to both sections 312 and 503b of the Act,12 and the Commission has so interpreted the term in the section 503b context.13 In order to impose such a penalty, the Commission must issue a notice of apparent liability, the notice must be received, and the person against whom the notice has been issued must have an opportunity to show, in writing, why no such penalty should be imposed.14 The Commission will then issue a forfeiture if it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person has willfully or repeatedly violated the Act or a Commission rule.15 6. Under section 11.45a of the Commissions rules, no person may transmit or cause to transmit the EAS codes or Attention Signal, or a recording or simulation thereof, in any circumstance other than in an actual National, State or Local Area emergency or authorized test of the EAS or as specified in sections 10.520d, 11.46, and 11.61 of this chapter.16 The Commission adopted section Continued from previous page 9 See generally False, Fraudulent, or Unauthorized Use of the Emergency Alert System or Wireless Emergency Alert Codes or Attention Signals is Strictly Prohibited, Public Notice, 34 FCC Rcd 7041 EB 2019 Enforcement Advisory promoting understanding of the regulations governing the appropriate use of EAS Tones Viacom FO, 30 FCC Rcd 797 affirming findings that Viacom and ESPN committed violations of the Commissions rules by transmitting or causing transmission of EAS Tones in a promotional announcement for the movie, Olympus Has Fallen, on cable networks 2013 EAS Enforcement Advisory, 28 FCC Rcd 15438 promoting understanding of the laws governing appropriate use of EAS Tones to address concerns about misuse of EAS Tones aired in order to capture audience attention when there is no actual emergency or test.

NW Communications of Phoenix, Inc. NW Communications of Austin, Inc. New World Communications of Atlanta, Inc. New World Communications of Tampa, Inc. and New World Communications of Detroit, Inc. FOX, a publicly traded Delaware corporation, is a news, sports, and entertainment company.19 FOX owns and operates a television broadcast network that produces and distributes programming on its 29 full power broadcast television stations, and to its more than 200 domestic affiliate stations.20 FOX programming is available in essentially all U.S. households, and its owned-and-operated television stations include 14 of the 15 largest television markets in the United States.21 FOX maintains that it is a leader in marquee live sports broadcasts, and that FOX Sports programming, including the NFL is 1 in live sports viewership among all television networks.22 8. The Commission received information from multiple sources alleging that at approximately 1220 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 28, 2021, FOX apparently transmitted, or caused the transmission of, EAS Tones during a FOX NFL promotional segment Promotional Segment, in the absence of any actual emergency, authorized test of the EAS, or qualified PSA.23 The Enforcement Bureaus Investigations and Hearings Division issued a letter of inquiry LOI on January 4, 2022, Continued from previous page alerting.

In enforcing Section 11.45 of the Commissions rules, the Commission explained The plain language of the rule prohibits any transmission of the EAS Tones in the absence of an actual emergency or authorized test . . . . Moreover, section 11.45 contains no provision limiting liability under the rule to cases where intent to deceive exists, nor does the rule make exceptions for, or protect, dramatic uses of the EAS Tones. Instead, the rule provides that the transmission of the EAS Tones is prohibited in any circumstance except when an actual emergency or authorized test warrants their use.

In its LOI Response, FOX describes the Promotional Segment as a short comedic advertisement for an upcoming game, aired as part of the FOX NFL SUNDAY pre-game show.25 FOX admits that the Promotional Segment used an approximately three-second excerpt of the EAS Attention Signal commonly used to precede broadcast emergency alerts two simultaneous tones of 853 Hz and 960 Hz.26 The three-second excerpt of the EAS Attention Signal was downloaded or recorded from a YouTube video.27 FOX further admits that its transmission of the Promotional Segment, and the EAS Tones, was not made in connection with any Permitted Use, i.e., an actual emergency, authorized test of the EAS, or qualified PSA.28 FOX acknowledges that it broadcast the Promotional Segment over 18 of its owned-and-operated stations, and transmitted it to 190 network affiliated stations nationwide.29 In addition to television distribution, FOX caused the transmission of the Promotional Segment on Fox Sports Radio, the leading voice in sports talk entertainment, broadcasting to radio stations nationwide and reaching nearly 15 million listeners on iHeartRadio and FOXSportsRadio.com,30 and on the Fox Sports on XM channel, which is carried nationwide on the Sirius XM satellite digital audio radio service.31 FOX asserts that the Promotional Segment was provided and distributed by the Fox Broadcasting Company, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Fox Corporation.32 Certain members of FOXs production team reviewed the Promotional Segment following its development, and prior to its public transmission, but provided no comments or changes.33 24 See Letter from Christopher Sova, Deputy Chief, Investigations and Hearings Division, FCC Enforcement Bureau, to Joseph M.

DelNero and Brooke Kahn, counsel to FOX, to Anya Baez, FCC Feb. 18, 2022 on file in EB-IHD-21-00033079 Supplemental LOI Response. 30 FOX transmitted the Promotional Segment on its FOX NFL SUNDAY programming, and licensed its distribution on Fox Sports Radio. See LOI Response at 2-3 While FOX does not maintain a list of all radio stations affiliated with Fox Sports Radio, it is FOXs understanding that such stations typically broadcast FOX NFL SUNDAY. Therefore, FOX knowingly caused the transmission on iHeartRadio and FOXSportsRadio.com. See, e.g., Viacom NAL, 29 FCC Rcd at 2558, para. 23 section 11.45 clearly applies to actions that cause to transmit the restricted tones and is not limited to direct transmissions CBS NAL, 34 FCC Rcd at 8423, para. 13 prohibition thus applies to programmers that distribute programming containing a prohibited sound regardless of whether or not they deliver the unlawful signal directly to consumers.

See LOI Response at 8. 32 Id. at 2. 33 Id. at 6. 781 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-4 III. DISCUSSION 10. We find that FOX apparently willfully violated section 11.45a of the Commissions rules. FOX confirms that the November 28, 2021 broadcast of the Promotional Segment included the EAS Tones.34 FOX admits that its wholly owned subsidiary created and distributed the Promotional Segment with the EAS Tones, and that it was broadcast by 18 of FOXs owned-and-operated television broadcast stations and 190 network-affiliated television broadcast stations nationwide.35 FOX further admits the Promotional Segment that included the EAS Tones was transmitted nationwide over Fox Sports Radio and Fox Sports on XM.36 FOX also admits that none of the material in question was transmitted in connection with an actual national, state, or local emergency, authorized test, or qualified PSA.37 11. Based on FOXs admissions and our review of the video recording of the Promotional Segment, we find that FOX apparently violated section 11.45a of the Commissions rules in its capacity as a broadcast programming network and, separately, as a multi-station broadcast licensee.38 Therefore, we find FOX responsible for broadcasting the Promotional Segment containing the EAS Tones on 18 of its owned-and-operated broadcast stations, transmitting the Promotional Segment to 190 of its network- affiliated television broadcast stations, and causing the transmission of the Promotional Segment on Fox Sports Radio and the Fox Sports on XM channel. 12. Despite being shorter in duration than the full EAS Tones,39 the three-second EAS Tone used in the Promotional Segment possessed the same dual-tone frequency, pitch, and timbre as the actual EAS Tones, and was recognizable by viewers or listeners as substantially similar to the EAS Tones.40 The Promotional Segments comedic tone41 also did not alter or neutralize its overall effect of falsely warning listeners and viewers of a non-existent emergency, as the EAS Tones were clearly audible, cognizable, and appropriated for a non-emergency use.42 This manner of appropriation of the EAS Tones is exactly the type of simulation that the Commissions rules seek to address and prohibit in order to avoid diluting the EAS Tones real meaning over time.43 IV.

Section 1.80b of the Commissions rules provides for a base forfeiture of 8,000 for various EAS and false distress rule violations, for each violation or each day of a continuing violation.50 The Commission has previously applied an 8,000 base forfeiture for violations of section 11.45a of the Commissions rules.51 We have discretion, however, to depart from the base forfeiture guidelines, taking into account the particular facts of each individual case.52 In determining the proposed forfeiture amount, we considered the factors outlined in the Commissions Forfeiture Policy Statement, section 1.80 of the Commissions rules, and section 503 of the Act. We have considered the number of transmissions at issue, FOXs sizeable nationwide audience reach, the gravity of the violation, the violators degree of culpability, ability to pay, and the serious public safety implications of the apparent violations, as well as the other factors outlined in the Commissions Forfeiture Policy Statement and section 1.80 of the Commissions rules. 15. The nature of EAS violations requires particularly serious consideration because, among other issues, such violations undermine the integrity of the EAS by desensitizing the public to the potential importance of warning tones. EAS violations therefore implicate substantial public safety concerns. As explained in the CBS NAL, our forfeiture determination in such cases is based on multiple factors associated with the nature of the violation and the violator.53 When applying the statutory factors concerning the circumstances, extent, and gravity of an EAS violation, we take into account a number of specific factors, including 1 the number of repetitions i.e., the number of individual transmissions 2 the duration of the violation i.e., the number of days or months over which the violation occurred 3 the audience reach of the transmissions e.g., nationwide, regional, or local and 4 the extent of the 45 47 U.S.C.  503b2A 47 CFR  1.80b1. See Amendment of Section 1.80b of the Commissions Rules, Annual Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties to Reflect Inflation, DA-22-1356, 88 Fed.

In this case, we find FOX responsible for broadcasting the EAS Tones during the Promotional Segment over 18 television broadcast stations that it owns and operates. In its capacity as a broadcast licensee, FOX transmitted the EAS Tones one time over each of its 18 television broadcast stations, resulting in a base forfeiture of 144,000. 17. Reviewing the factors in this case, we find that an upward adjustment is warranted. FOX stated that its programming is available in essentially all U.S. households, and its television broadcast stations are located in the five largest, and fifteen of the top twenty, television markets in the United States.55 As such, the audience reach of each of the FOX owned-and-operated stations is considerable and warrants an upward adjustment of the base forfeiture levied against FOXs 18 television broadcast stations. Moreover, in this particular case, the creation and transmission of the Promotional Segment involved a self-promotion by FOX for its upcoming pre-game programming and NFL game.56 As a leader in live sports broadcasts,57 and a longstanding broadcast licensee, FOX was well aware of the importance and implementation of the EAS rules.58 We find that, in view of the gravity of the violation and the violators degree of culpability, this self-promotion for the purposes of additional economic gain59 at the expense of the integrity of the EAS constitutes egregious misconduct warranting an additional upward adjustment. 18. We also find FOX responsible for transmitting the Promotional Segment containing the EAS Tones to its television station affiliates nationwide for broadcast, as well as Fox Sports Radio and Fox Sports on XM. These were separate actions that resulted in separate transmissions of the simulated EAS Tones.60 The Commission is not pursuing a forfeiture in this case for FOXs transmissions and responsibilities in its capacity as a programming network due to the expiration of the statute of limitations period. However, we emphasize that these actions constitute violations of the Commissions rules, and we find that they warrant an additional upward adjustment.61 19. Given the totality of the circumstances, and consistent with the Forfeiture Policy Statement, section 1.80 of the Commissions rules, and the statutory factors, we conclude that a proposed forfeiture of 504,000 is appropriate in this case for FOXs apparent egregious violation of section 11.45a of the Commissions rules. 54 See id. 55 See 2021 SEC Form 10-K, supra note 20, at I-3 LOI Response at Exhibit D  Fox Owned  Operated Stations. 56 LOI Response at 2. 57 2021 Form SEC 10-K, supra note 20, at I-2. 58 LOI Response at 6-9. 59 FOX reported a quarterly revenue of 4.44 Billion for October 1 - December 31, 2021, which encompassed the date this Promotional Segment aired.

Based on our review of the current record, we find no basis for a downward adjustment.62 First, this was not a minor violation. FOX had clear and unambiguous notice of the requirements and applicability of the EAS rules to its advertising programming,63 as evidenced in its advertising guidelines, which clearly prohibited the use of EAS Tones, or simulation thereof, in advertisements under any circumstances.64 Yet, despite touting that it is fully knowledgeable and has a policy barring the improper use of the EAS Attention Signals, which was purportedly made known generally to employees of FOX involved in the production of programming, FOX admits that all personnel involved in creation and review of the Nov. 28 Segment  lacked full understanding of FOXs policy against use of EAS Attention Signals.65 Second, this case involved a mandatory, not voluntary, disclosure. Commission rule 11.45b requires EAS participants to notify the Commission within 24 hours of discovering it has transmitted a false alert to the public.66 FOXs having sent an e-mail to the FCC Ops Center67 as required by the Commissions rules, does not constitute the type of good faith disclosure that warrants a reduction to the proposed forfeiture amount.68 Third, as FOX acknowledges, it has been the subject of previous enforcement actions.69 We therefore find no countervailing downward adjustment to be appropriate based on compliance history.70 Finally, we note that FOX reported substantial revenue of 4.44 billion for the relevant quarter.71 FOX clearly has an ability to pay, and there is nothing in the record that would indicate that the penalty is otherwise excessive.72 Therefore, we find FOX apparently liable for a total forfeiture of 504,000.73 62 47 CFR  1.80b10, Table 3 downward adjustment factors include minor violations, good faith or voluntary disclosure, history of overall compliance, and inability to pay. 63 See, e.g., Viacom NAL, 29 FCC Rcd at 2558-59, para. 23. 64 LOI Response at 6-7 Exhibit G. 65 Id. at 7-8. 66 47 CFR  11.45b. 67 LOI Response at 6. 68 FOX acknowledges that it received multiple notifications from representatives of broadcast affiliates concerning this matter.

The Commission has before it for comparative consideration 34 groups of mutually exclusive MX applications for new noncommercial educational NCE FM station construction permits.1 By this Memorandum Opinion and Order Order, we perform threshold fair distribution of service analyses and use a point system to tentatively select an application for grant in each group. Petitions to deny the application of any of these tentative selectees must be filed within 30 days of the 1 On November 29, 2021, the Media Bureau Bureau issued a public notice identifying 231 groups of mutually exclusive NCE FM applications. See Media Bureau Identifies Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications Submitted in the November 2021, Filing Window for New Noncommercial Educational Stations, MB Docket No. 20-343, Public Notice, DA 21-1476 MB rel. Nov. 29, 2021 NCE MX Public Notice. Each of the groups analyzed herein was included in the NCE MX Public Notice. 789 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 date of release of this Order.2 2. We address in this Order applications that were filed in November 2021, during the most recent filing window for new NCE FM applications.3 These applicants have had an opportunity to enter into settlement agreements among themselves to resolve mutual exclusivity,4 and, in the absence of any such settlement, are now subject to a simplified, comparative process codified in Part 73, Subpart K, of our rules.5 II. GENERAL NCE COMPARATIVE PROCEDURES 3. Given the finite nature of and high demand for spectrum, the Commission cannot grant a construction permit to every qualified NCE applicant. Due to the noncommercial nature of the NCE service, MX6 applications for new station construction permits are not subject to auction, but are resolved by applying comparative procedures.7 Specifically, the Commissions comparative analysis of MX NCE applications generally consists of three main components. First, when NCE FM applicants in an MX group propose service to different communities, the Commission performs a threshold fair distribution analysis under section 307b of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended the Act.8 Second, application conflicts that are not resolved under this fair distribution analysis are compared by the Commission under an NCE point system,9 which is a simplified, paper hearing process.10 Third, if 2 See 47 CFR  73.7004b. 3 See Media Bureau Announces NCE FM New Station Application Filing Window Window Open from November 2, 2021, to November 9, 2021, MB Docket No. 20-343, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 7449 MB rel. April 21, 2021. The window was available for FM reserved band channels 201-220 proposals. See 47 CFR  73.501. 4 See NCE MX Public Notice at 2-5. The NCE FM applicants had an opportunity to enter into and file settlement agreements and to submit technical amendments to resolve conflicts and expedite the grant of applications filed in the NCE FM window. 5 47 CFR  73.7000  7005.

An MX group consists of all applications which are MX to at least one other application in the group. 7 See Reexamination of the Comparative Standards for Noncommercial Educational Applicants, Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd 7386 2000 2000 NCE Order, clarified, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 16 FCC Rcd 5074 2001 2001 NCE MOO, recon. denied, Memorandum Opinion and Second Order on Reconsideration, 17 FCC Rcd 13132 2002.

Although the Media Bureau has delegated authority to perform the Section 307b analyses, we are performing the Section 307b analyses, where applicable herein, for certain groups in conjunction with our point system analyses in order to expedite consideration of these groups. See Comparative Consideration of 76 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New or Modified Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 22 FCC Rcd 6101, n.16 2007 NCE Omnibus 27 Group Comparative Order, supra note 5.

Each of these steps is described in greater detail below.11 A. 307b --Threshold Fair Distribution Study. 4. Section 307b states that the Commission must provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of broadcast service among the states and communities.12 In accordance with this directive, the Commission considers the fair distribution of service as a first, or threshold, issue in its NCE FM comparative review process13 in order to ascertain whether grant of any of the applications would best further the Section 307b objective.14 The first step of the Section 307b, or fair distribution, analysis, is to determine whether any of the applicants in the MX group is a federally recognized Native American Tribe or Alaska Native Village proposing to serve Tribal Lands15 and claims the Tribal Priority.16 5. If there is no Tribal Applicant in the MX group,17 the second step in the Section 307b analysis is to determine whether any applicant would provide a first or second reserved band channel NCE aural service to a substantial population the First or Second NCE Service Preference by comparing population coverage totals.18 Specifically, during this step, an NCE FM applicant is eligible to receive a 11 In advance of the November 2021 filing window, the Commission amended its rules and procedures for filing NCE FM applications and selecting and licensing competing NCE FM applications. See NCE LPFM Order, supra note 7. The changes were designed to improve the comparative selection procedures, reduce confusion among future applicants, expedite the initiation of new service to the public, and eliminate unnecessary applicant burdens.

Applicants Form 2100, Schedule 340, Fair Distribution of Service certifications enable the Commission to consider whether service to one community over the other would best achieve the Commissions directive to distribute radio service fairly among communities. 15 See 47 CFR  73.7000, 73.7002b. 16 An NCE FM applicant is eligible to receive a fair distribution preference, and ultimately be awarded the construction permit, if it identifies itself as a Tribal Applicant, proposes Tribal Coverage, and proposes the first reserved channel NCE service owned by any Tribal Applicant at a community of license located on Tribal Lands the Tribal Priority. See 47 CFR  73.7000 defining a Tribal Applicant and Tribal Coverage see also 47 CFR  73.7002b Policies to Promote Rural Radio Service and to Streamline Allotment and Assignment Procedures, First Report and Order, 25 FCC Rcd 1583 2010 establishing the Section 307b Tribal Priority.

April 19, 2022. 17 None of the MX groups addressed in this Order contain a Tribal Applicant. Accordingly, the first step of the Section 307b analysis, the Tribal Priority analysis, is inapplicable herein. 18 See 47 CFR  73.7002b. 791 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 fair distribution preference or Section 307b preference19 if it would provide a first or second reserved band channel NCE aural service to at least 10 of the population in the aggregate, within the proposed stations service area, provided that the population served is at least 2,000 people. If only one applicant in an MX group qualifies for the First or Second NCE Service Preference, its fair distribution Section 307b preference is dispositive,20 and that applicant will be awarded the construction permit. 6. If more than one applicant in the MX group claims a First or Second NCE Service Preference, the applicant proposing to provide the greatest number of people with the highest level of service will be awarded a construction permit, if it will provide such service to at least 10 of the people within the station's 60 dBu contour and to at least 5,000 more people than the next best applicant.21 First service will be preferred over second service.22 Accordingly, the Commission first examines the applicants' first service levels alone to determine whether one of the proposals is superior and should receive a decisive preference. If such applicants are equivalent with respect to first service, or no applicant qualifies for a first service preference, the Commission considers combined first and second NCE aural service population totals. At each stage of the Section 307b analysis, any applicant that is comparatively disfavored in terms of Section 307b eligibility or service totals is eliminated. The process ends when the Commission determines that one applicant is entitled to a Section 307b preference, or that either 1 none of the remaining applicants can be selected or eliminated based on a Section 307b preference, or 2 each remaining applicant proposes to serve the same community. Any remaining MX applicants proposing equivalent service overall, or proposing the same community, proceed to a point system analysis.23 7. Each applicant claiming a First or Second NCE Service preference must support its fair distribution claim with an exhibit identifying the population residing within the proposed stations 60 dB service contour and the number of people that would receive a new first or second NCE aural service.24 Further, any applicant which receives a decisive Section 307b preference is required to construct and operate technical facilities substantially as proposed, and cannot downgrade service to the area on which the preference was based for a period of four years of on-air operations.25 19 The terms fair distribution preference and Section 307b preference are used interchangeably to refer to the preference given to an MX application that is deemed to substantially further the fair distribution of service goals enunciated in Section 307b. 20 As noted, in the case of an MX group with a Tribal Applicant, an applicant qualifying for a Tribal Priority, however, will prevail over any MX applicant claiming a First or Second NCE Service Preference. 21 47 CFR  73.7002b. 22 Id. 23 See 47 CFR  73.7003 point system selection procedures. 24 See id.  73.7002b. Applicants were required to use the most recently available, i.e., 2010 Census, population data. See Media Bureau Announces NCE FM New Station Filing Procedures and Requirements for November 2-9, 2021, Window, DA 21-885, at 5-7 and n.24 MB rel. July 23, 2021 NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice FCC Form 2100, Schedule 340, Instructions for Fair Distribution of Service at 12-14. An applicants fair distribution showing must be computed as of the time of filing close of the filing window for applications filed prior to the window and cannot be enhanced thereafter. See 47 CFR  73.7003e and f3 NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice at 11 2001 NCE MOO, 16 FCC Rcd at 5082-83. However, an applicant that subsequently makes engineering changes that would diminish its fair distribution position must amend its application to reflect that diminished position. See 47 CFR  1.65 and 73.7003e. 25 See 47 CFR  73.7005b see also 47 CFR  73.7002c. During this period, such applicant may make minor modifications to its authorized facilities, provided that i the modification does not downgrade service to the area on which the preference was based, or ii any potential loss of first and second NCE service is offset by at least equal first and, separately, combined first and second NCE service population gains, and the applicant would continue to qualify for a decisive Section 307b preference.. Id. 792 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 B. Point System Selection Process. 8. The Commission compares mutually exclusive groups of NCE FM applications, which cannot be decided pursuant to the Section 307b analysis, under the point system set forth in section 73.7003 of the rules.26 The NCE point system awards a maximum of seven merit points, based on four distinct criteria, described below.27 When MX NCE FM applications proceed to a point system analysis, the Commission reviews the applicants point submissions28 to compare the MX applications and tentatively select the application with the highest point total from each MX group for grant.29 9. First, we award three points to applicants certifying that they have been local and established for at least two years. To qualify for the three points as an established local applicant30 an applicant must certify that it has been local and established in the community to be served continuously for at least two years immediately prior to the application filing.31 To be considered local, a non- governmental applicant must have a physical headquarters, campus, or 75 of its governing board members residing within 25 miles of the reference coordinates of the proposed community of license.32 A governmental unit is considered local within its jurisdictional boundaries.33 10. If an applicant certifies that it is an established local applicant it must submit substantiating documentation with its application to illustrate how it qualifies as local and established.34 Examples of acceptable documentation include corporate material from the secretary of state, lists of names, addresses, and length of residence of board members and copies of governing documents requiring a 75 local governing board, or course brochures indicating that classes have been offered at a local campus for the preceding two years.35 Any applicant awarded localism points in this Order has provided support for its certification. Thus, the specific point system determinations for each MX group 26 See 47 CFR  73.7003. Unlike the 307b analysis, the point system selection process cannot be performed by the Bureau on delegated authority. See 2000 NCE Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7420. 27 See 47 CFR  73.7003b. 28 Each NCE FM applicant was required to complete the Point System FactorsTie Breakers Section of FCC Form 2100, Schedule 340, Noncommercial Educational Station for Reserved Channel Construction Permit Application Schedule 340 in the Bureaus Licensing and Management System LMS by the November 9, 2021 filing deadline. 29 The Commission has reaffirmed its longstanding one-grant policy. See NCE Order on Reconsideration, supra note 7. The one-grant policy provides that only one application should be granted out of each mutually exclusive group, while providing the remaining competing applicants the opportunity to file again in the next filing window. Id. The Commission will not authorize secondary grants in MX NCE FM groups after the initial resolution of the MX applications. A secondary grant process would allow non-winning applicants that are not mutually exclusive with the tentative selectee to proceed to a second round of analysis by the Commission. Id. See also NCE LPFM Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 12528, n.68 reaffirming the established one-grant policy and declining to pursue a secondary application grant practice. 30 See 47 CFR  73.7000. 31 See id.  73.7003b1. 32 A local headquarters or residence must be a primary place of business or residence and not, for example, a post office box, lawyer's office, branch office, or vacation home, which are more easily feigned andor present less of an opportunity for meaningful contact with the community. See 2000 Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7410, para. 54. 33 For example, a state government is considered local throughout the state a City Board of Education is considered local through the city a state university is considered local throughout the state. 34 An applicant claiming points as an established local applicant must also pledge to maintain localism characteristics during the period from grant of the construction permit until the station has achieved at least four years of on-air operations. See 47 CFR  73.7005c see also NCE LPFM Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 12523, para 8. 35 See NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice at 8. 793 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 that follows only discuss an applicants documentation if it is insufficient to justify awarding localism points. 11. Second, we award two points for local diversity of ownership if no party to the application holds an attributable interest in any other station within the principal community contours of the applicants proposed station.36 To qualify for the diversity of ownership points, an applicant must submit either a contour map showing no overlap with the proposed NCE FM station, a statement that the applicant holds no attributable interests in any nearby radio stations, or a certification that it holds no attributable interests in any broadcast stations.37 Any applicant awarded diversity of ownership points in this Order has either satisfied this requirement or submitted a divestiture pledge, as detailed below. Thus, the specific point system determinations for each MX group that follows only discuss an applicants documentation if it is insufficient to justify awarding diversity points. 12. We note that an NCE FM applicant with an overlapping attributable interest, however, can still qualify for diversity of ownership points if it commits to divest the broadcast interest or resign from the attributable positional interest.38 The applicant must submit the divestiture pledge with the application by the close of the filing window. We do not require the applicant to divest or resign by the close of the filing window. Rather, if we award that applicant a construction permit based on points, the applicant must complete the actual divestiture or resignation by the time the new NCE FM station commences program test operations.39 13. Third, we award two points for certain state-wide networks providing programming to accredited schools. These points are available only to applicants that cannot claim a credit for local diversity of ownership.40 The state-wide network credit is an alternative for applicants that use multiple stations to serve large numbers of schools and, therefore, do not qualify for the local diversity of ownership credit. Applicants claiming points as a state-wide network must submit supporting documentation as an application exhibit.41 14. Fourth, an applicant that proposes the best technical proposal in the group i.e., proposes service to the largest population and area, excluding substantial areas of water may receive up to two points. The applicant receives one point if its proposed service area and population are 10 greater than those of the next best area and population proposals, or two points if both are 25 greater than those of the next best area and population proposals as measured by each proposed stations predicted 60 dBu signal strength contour.42 If the best technical proposal does not meet the 10 threshold, no applicant is 36 See 47 CFR  73.7003b2. Parties with attributable interests are defined as the applicant, its parent, subsidiaries, their officers, and members of their governing boards. See 47 CFR  73.7000. Interests of certain entities providing more than 33 of the applicants equity andor debt are also attributable. Id. 37 See Attributable Interests, Other Authorizations, of Schedule 340. An applicant claiming points for diversity of ownership must also pledge to comply with the restrictions on station modifications and acquisitions during the period from grant of the construction permit until the station has achieved at least four years of on-air operations. See 47 CFR  73.7005c see also NCE LPFM Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 12524, para. 12. 38 See NCE LPFM Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 12525, para. 13 expanding the Commissions divestiture policy by recognizing full-service station divestiture pledges for comparative purposes and crediting all contingent divestiture pledges that are made and submitted by the close of the filing window. 39 Id. 40 See 47 CFR  73.7003b3. 41 See Form 2100, Schedule 340 Instructions at page 16 detailing preferred documentation to support this point claim. 42 Id.  73.7003b4. See NCE Omnibus, 22 FCC Rcd at 6121-22, paras. 50-51. If there is one top applicant in terms of area and population, that applicant will receive one point even if there is no single next best applicant for continued. 794 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 awarded points under this criterion. In considering this criterion, we have accepted applicants coverage and population claims.43 15. Finally, the Commission tallies the total number of points awarded to each applicant. The applicant with the highest score in a group is designated the tentative selectee. All other applicants are eliminated. C. Tie-Breakers. 16. In the event MX applicants are tied with the highest number of points, the tied applicants proceed to a tie-breaker round.44 The first tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant.45 The applicant with the fewest attributable authorizations prevails and becomes the tentative selectee. If the tie is not broken by this first factor, we apply a second tie-breaker the number of pending radio station applications attributable to each applicant.46 The tentative selectee will be the applicant with the fewest pending new and major change applications in the same service. 17. If a tie remains after the second tie-breaker, applicants are considered under a third and final tie-breaker criterion  prior NCE applications.47 The tentative selectee will be the applicant that can demonstrate that 1 it applied in a previous filing window, and had its application accepted for filing and processed, but subsequently dismissed in favor of an applicant possessing superior points or a tie-breaker showing 2 it was in continuous existence as a legal entity at all times from the date of the previous NCE window filing until the present and 3 it does not hold any NCE construction permit or license.48 If this third factor fails to break the tie, we use time-sharing as the tie-breaker of last resort. Specifically, we designate the remaining tied applicants in the MX group as the tentative selectees and direct the tentative selectees to submit, within 90 days of the release of the Order identifying the tentative selectees, a voluntary time-sharing agreement.49 both factors. The Commission will compare the top applicants proposed area to the proposed area of the applicant with the next best area proposal and the top applicants population to the proposed population of the applicant with the next best population proposal. 43 Our procedures for this filing window required applicants to measure area in square kilometers and exclude significant areas of water, e.g., oceans and lakes, and measure population using the 2010 Census Block Data available from the Census Bureau. See Form 2100, Schedule 340 Instructions at page 16. 44 See 47 CFR  73.7003c. 45 Id.  73.7003c1. Applicants are required to count all attributable full service commercial and NCE radio stations licenses and construction permits and any FM translator stations providing non-fill-in service. An applicant may exclude fill-in translators, any translator which the applicant seeks to replace with its applied for full- service NCE FM station, and any station, which it pledges to divest. See 2001 NCE MOO, 16 FCC Rcd at 5102- 03, para. 85 see also Form 2100, Schedule 340 Instructions at page 17. 46 See 47 CFR  73.7003c2. When reporting pending applications, applicants were required to include new and major change radio applications, including the subject application and all other applications filed in the window by the November 9, 2021 deadline. Applicants should not have included any requests to participate in an auction filed on Schedule 175 and other applications such as voluntary assignment of license, license renewal, and minor change in existing facilities. See NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice at 10. 47 See NCE LPFM Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 12527-28, para. 19 47 CFR  73.7003c3. 48 Id. Applicants were required to submit an attachment demonstrating their qualifications under this third tie- breaker criterion. 49 See 47 CFR  73.7003c4. If the tentative selectees do not agree on a voluntary time sharing arrangement within 90 days, we will impose mandatory time sharing, granting all tentative selectees equal, concurrent, non- renewable licenses. 47 CFR  73.7003c5. 795 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 D. Timely Documentation of Comparative Qualifications. 18. The NCE FM application, Schedule 340, is certification-based, but requires applicants to document certain of their claims by submitting supporting information.50 Applicants must submit timely- filed exhibits supporting their point claims. We will not give credit to certifications which require the applicant to submit documentation, but which are not supported with any such timely submitted documentation. For example, we reject claims in this Order where the applicant certifies that it qualifies for points as an established local applicant but fails to supply supporting information referred to in the certification. While there is some flexibility in the type of documentation an applicant may provide, an applicant that does not submit timely support cannot have made a valid certification and will not receive the claimed points.51 Similarly, we will not consider documentation to support a claimed comparative point if it was submitted in an amendment after the November 2021, filing deadline. In such cases, we adjust the points of such applicants downward. 19. Finally, the NCE FM applicant's qualifications for points are initially determined as of the closing of the filing window i.e., the November 9, 2021, filing deadline.52 For example, NCE organizations are considered established if they have operated as local entities since November 9, 2019, i.e., for at least two years prior to the November 9, 2021, Application Deadline. These snap shot applicant characteristics establish an applicant's maximum points and its maximum position in the event of a tie-breaker. This common reference date ensures a level competitive field for applicants, with their qualifications all compared as of the same time.53 In order to prevent gamesmanship, any changes made after the filing deadline may potentially diminish, but cannot enhance, an applicant's comparative position and point total. Therefore, we have taken into account any amendments that adversely affect an applicants point total and comparative position. We have not considered any amendments, filed after the filing deadline, which improve an applicants comparative position.54 III. GROUP-BY-GROUP ANALYSES 20. This Section contains narrative descriptions of our analyses, organized sequentially by group number. Unless otherwise noted, each component of the analysis is based on information provided by each of the respective applicants.55 We have provided readers with an Appendix that condenses the group-by-group narratives that follow into chart form for quick reference. 50 See 2000 NCE Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7423, para. 89. 51 See, e.g., Comparative Consideration of 32 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New or Modified Noncommercial Educational FM Stations Filed in the October 2007 Filing Window, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 25 FCC Rcd 5013, 5017, para. 11 2010 applicant submitting no timely documentation at all cannot be found to have made a valid certification. 52 See 47 CFR  73.7003e. 53 See, e.g., 2001 NCE MOO, 16 FCC Rcd at 5082-83, paras. 23-26 see also id. at 5083, para. 26 Of overall concern to us in this area is that we are comparing applications that use the same data. Reliance on information as of the close of the window will ensure that applicants have essentially a common reference date. With a common reference date and a common method of calculating population, the staff will analyze applicants on a similar basis.. 54 See 47 CFR  73.7003e. For example, an applicant may lose claimed points, such as the diversity of ownership points, as a result of acquiring an overlapping station after the November 2021, filing deadline. In contrast, if an applicant certifies that it does not qualify for one of the point factors, it cannot later amend its application to claim such points. This is the case even if the applicant actually would have qualified for the point it is seeking at the time it filed the application. 55 See FCC Form 2100, Schedule 340, Fair Distribution of Service certifications and Point System FactorsTiebreakers certifications. 796 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 21. At the outset, we again note that each group of applicants has had an opportunity to resolve mutual exclusivities by settlement and technical amendment. In addition, we emphasize that applicants were required to report their qualifications as of the date of closing of the filing window.56 Any changes made thereafter may potentially have diminished, but could not enhance, an applicants comparative position. Finally, we note that the majority of these 34 groups require no discussion of the initial 307b analysis because the applicants within the group either all proposed to serve the same community57 or certified that they are not eligible for a fair distribution preference. In such cases, we proceed directly to the point system analysis. 22. Group 14. This group consists of three applications proposing service to different communities in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Gentry Communications Network, Inc. GCN proposes to serve Sulphur Springs, Arkansas Centro Familiar de Restauracion y Vida CFRV proposes to serve Noel, Missouri and Citizenship Tulsa, Inc. CT proposes to serve Adair, Oklahoma. Each applicant claims that it is eligible for a fair distribution preference.58 GCN and CT each claims a fair distribution preference based on first NCE service population totals. CFRV does not, and is therefore, eliminated. GCN and CT claim to provide first NCE service to 7,772 people and 6,198 people, respectively. The proposals are comparable because neither exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people. Accordingly, we consider combined first and second NCE service population totals. GCN would provide a first or second NCE service to 18,334 people 7,772 first service plus 10,562 second service CT to 18,332 people 6,198 first service plus 12,134 second service. Because these proposals are also comparable, GCN and CT proceed to a point system analysis. 23. GCN claims three points as an established local applicant. CT certifies that it is not entitled to any points under this criterion. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership, with GCNs claim based on a commitment to divest LPFM station KOZR-LP, Gentry, Arkansas. CT did not submit documentation to support its diversity claim, and certifies that it has two other existing authorizations. Thus, we do not award diversity of ownership points to CT.59 Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, GCNs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,973 square kilometers with a population of 34,210. CTs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,674 square kilometers with a population of 29,747. GCN qualifies for one point as the best technical proposal because it proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than CT. Accordingly, CT is not credited with any points, and GCN is credited with a total of six points. GCN is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 14. 24. Group 16. This group consists of two applications proposing service to different communities in Arizona. Remanente Broadcasting Network RBN proposes to serve Dudleyville, and Arizona Board of Regents for Benefit of University of Arizona ABOR proposes to serve Kearny. Neither applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, the applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 56 NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice at 10-11. 57 The fair distribution analysis is only considered when applicants in an MX group propose to serve different communities. 58 See File Nos. 167736, 167086 and 167841, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits. GCNs 60 dBu contour encompasses 34,210 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 18,334 people. CFRVs 60 dBu contour encompasses 40,137 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 15,524 people. CTs 60 dBu contour encompasses 29,747 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 18,332 people. Thus, each applicant would provide a combined first and second NCE service to at least 10 of the population within its 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people. 59 We note that even if we were to award the two diversity points to CT, it would not change the outcome of this group. 797 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 25. ABOR claims three points as an established local applicant. RBN certifies that it is not entitled to any points under this criterion. RBN claims two points for diversity of ownership ABOR does not. Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, RBNs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 4,140 square kilometers with a population of 23,872. ABORs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,523 square kilometers with a population of 7,351. RBN qualifies for one point as the best technical proposal because it would serve at least 10 more area and population than ABOR. Accordingly, RBN and ABOR are each credited with three points and proceed to the tie-breaker analysis. 26. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. RBN certifies that it has no attributable interest in any radio authorization, and ABOR certifies that it has attributable interests in 26 radio authorizations. RBN is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 16.60 27. Group 32. This group consists of three applications proposing service to different communities in California. Delta 2000 Delta proposes to serve Byron Iglesia del Valle IDV proposes to serve Manteca and Hatch Workshop HW proposes to serve Terminous. No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, the applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 28. Each applicant claims three points as an established local applicant. However, because IDV did not submit any supporting documentation for its localism claim, we do not award IDV localism points. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership. IDV, however, certifies that it has one other existing authorization and did not submit documentation to support its diversity claim. We, therefore, do not award IDV points under this criterion. IDV also claims two points as a state-wide network. Such points, however, are only available to applicants that do not qualify for two points for diversity of ownership. IDV cannot claim points under both criteria.61 With respect to technical parameters, Deltas proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 167 square kilometers with a population of 10,376. HWs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 274 square kilometers with a population of 37,566. IDVs application is incomplete because it only lists the proposed population, and we, therefore, cannot consider IDVs technical parameters in our analysis. HW qualifies for two points as the best technical proposal because it proposes to serve at least 25 more area and population than Delta. Accordingly, IDV is not credited with any points, Delta is credited with a total of five points, and HW is credited with a total of seven points. HW is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 32. 29. Group 34. This group consists of three applications proposing service to different communities in California. Remanente Broadcasting Network RBN proposes to serve Boron Cedar Broadcasting, Inc. CBI proposes to serve Randsburg and Nevada Public Radio NPR proposes to serve Ridgecrest. No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, the applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 30. No applicant claims points as an established local applicant or as a state-wide network. RBN and NPR claim two points each for diversity of ownership. CBI certifies that it is not entitled to points under this criterion. With respect to technical parameters, RBNs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 8,002 square kilometers with a population of 42,073. CBIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 4,838 square kilometers with a population of 49,003. NPRs proposed 60 dBu contour would 60 We note that Triangle Access Broadcasting, Inc. TABI filed an Informal Objection to the RBN application. See Pleading No. 167141. We generally do not consider objections at this stage, but rather, review the merits of any objection ifwhen the subject application becomes accepted for filing. We will review the merits of TABIs objection after the tentative selectees application is accepted for filing. 61 See 47 CFR  73.7003b3. Moreover, IDV does not submit any information to support its claim that it qualifies as a state-wide network. 798 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 encompass 8,571 square kilometers with a population of 53,539. Because no applicants proposal would serve at least 10 more area and population than the next best proposal, we do not award points for this criterion. Accordingly, CBI is not credited with any points RBN and NPR are each credited with a total of two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis. 31. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. RBN certifies that it has no attributable interests in any radio authorization, and NPR certifies that it has attributable interests in 15 radio authorizations. RBN is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 34.62 32. Group 49B.63 This group consists of three applications proposing service to different communities in Virginia. Positive Alternative Radio, Inc. PAR proposes to serve Courtland Redeemer Broadcasting, Inc. RBI proposes to serve Fredericksburg and Calvary Baptist Church of Spotsylvania CBCS proposes to serve Spotsylvania. No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, the applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 33. CBCS claims three points as an established local applicant. PAR and RBI do not claim points under this criterion. RBI and CBCS claim two points each for diversity of ownership. PAR certifies that it does not qualify for points under this criterion. No applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, PARs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,764 square kilometers with a population of 153,432. RBIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,164 square kilometers with a population of 133,089. CBCSs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,407 square kilometers with a population of 146,515. No applicant qualifies for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than the next best proposal. Accordingly, PAR is not credited with any points RBI is credited with a total of two points CBCS is credited with a total of five points. CBCS is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 49B. 34. Group 50. This group consists of two applications proposing service to different communities in Florida. Putnam Radio Ministries, Inc. PRMI proposes to serve Keystone Heights, and Inverse Focus Ministry, Inc. IFMI proposes to serve Starke. Neither applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, the applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 35. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network. PRMI and IFMI each certifies that it is entitled to two points for diversity of ownership. PRMI, however, provides no support for its diversity claim, and certifies that it has one existing authorization. Accordingly, we do not award points to PRMI under this criterion.64 With respect to technical parameters, PRMIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 840 square kilometers with a population of 29,383. IFMIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 925 square kilometers with a population 62 We note that Triangle Access Broadcasting, Inc. TABI filed an Informal Objection to the RBN application. See Pleading No. 167141. We generally do not consider objections at this stage, but rather, review the merits of any objection ifwhen the subject application becomes accepted for filing. We will review the merits of TABIs objection after the tentative selectees application is accepted for filing. 63 Group 49, which originally contained 13 applications, was bifurcated as a result of a technical amendment. The other applications in the group were evaluated as Group 49A in a previous order. See Threshold Fair Distribution Analysis of 13 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 22-477, at para. 10 MB May 2, 2022 13 Group Fair Distribution Order. 64 We note that even if we were to award PRMI points for diversity of ownership, it would not change the outcome of this group. 799 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 of 34,857. IFMI receives one point under the best technical proposal criterion because it would serve at least 10 more area and population than PRMI. Accordingly, PRMI is not credited with any point, and IFMI is credited with a total of three points. IFMI is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 50. 36. Group 51. This group consists of two applications proposing service to the same community in Florida. Teleamerica Communications West Palm Beach Corp. TCW and Newland Broadcasters Incorporated NBI each proposes service to Key West. Because the applicants propose service to the same community, TCW and NBI proceed to a point system analysis. 37. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership. NBI also claims points as a state-wide network. Such points, however, are only available to applicants that do not qualify for two points for diversity of ownership. NBI cannot receive points under both criteria.65 With respect to technical parameters, TCWs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 16 square kilometers with a population of 24,649. NBIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 11 square kilometers with a population of 23,342. Because neither applicants proposal would serve at least 10 more area and population than the other, we do not award points for this criterion. Thus, TCW and NBI are each credited with a total of two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis. 38. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. TCW certifies that it has no attributable interests in any radio authorization, and NBI certifies that it has an attributable interest in one radio authorization. TCW therefore prevails based on this first tie-breaker and is the tentative selectee in Group 51.66 39. Group 54. This group consists of four applications proposing service to the same community in Florida. Call Communications Group, Inc. CCGI, Ethree Group, Inc. EGI, New Media Humanity Association Inc. NMHA, and Central Baptist Church of Ocala Inc. CBCO each proposes to serve Weeki Wachee. Because the applicants proposes to serve the same community, they proceed to a point system analysis. 40. No applicant claims that it qualifies for points as an established local applicant or state-wide network. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership with NMHAs claim based on a pledge to divest its LPFM station, WYPW-LP, Brandon, Florida. With respect to technical parameters, CCGIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 847 square kilometers with a population of 110,411. EGIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 693 square kilometers with a population of 88,689. NMHAs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 668 square kilometers with a population of 97,594. CBCOs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 945 square kilometers with a population of 105,470. No applicant is eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than the next best proposal. Accordingly, CCGI, EGI, NMHA, and CBCO are credited with a total of two points each and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis. 41. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. CCGI certifies that it has attributable interests in nine radio authorizations, and CBCO certifies that it has attributable interests in two radio authorizations. EGI and NMHA each certifies that it has no 65 See 47 CFR 73.7003b3. Moreover, NBI does not submit any information to support its claim that it qualifies as a state-wide network. 66 Between December 20, 2021, to May 11, 2022, NBI filed several petitions to deny the TCW application. See Pleading Nos. 177507, 186288, and 190458. Because the TCW application has not yet been accepted for filing, the NBI petitions are premature and will not be considered at this stage. We will review the merits of the NBI petitions after the TCW application is accepted for filing. 800 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 attributable interest in any radio authorization. CCGI and CBCO are therefore eliminated, and EGI and NMHA proceed to the second tie-breaker  the number of pending radio applications attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest applications prevails. EGI certifies it has no pending applications, and NMHA certifies it has one pending application. EGIs count, however, is inaccurate because it does not include the instant application and its six other pending applications.67 After accounting for this error and adjustment, NMHA prevails on the basis of this second tie-breaker and is the tentative selectee in Group 54. 42. Group 55. This group consists of four applications to serve different communities in Florida. Ethree Group, Inc. EGI proposes to serve Big Pine Key West Radio KWR and Specialized Educational Broadcasting SEB each proposes to serve Key West Frequency Zero, Inc. FZI proposes to serve Stock Island. Each applicant certifies that it is not eligible for a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, all four applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 43. No applicant claims that it qualifies for points as an established local applicant or state- wide network. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership. With respect to technical parameters, EGIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 312 square kilometers with a population of 26,234. KWRs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 30 square kilometers with a population of 29,890. SEBs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 37 square kilometers with a population of 29,550. FZIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 33 square kilometers with a population of 31,066. No applicant is eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than the next best proposal. Accordingly, EGI, KWR, SEB, and FZI are each credited with a total of two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis. 44. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. Each applicant certifies that it has no attributable interest in any radio authorization. All four applicants, therefore, proceed to the second tie-breaker  the number of pending radio applications attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest applications prevails. EGI certifies it has no pending applications KWR certifies it has one pending application SEB certifies that it has five pending applications FZI certifies it has two pending applications. EGIs count, however, is inaccurate because it does not include the instant application and its six other pending applications.68 After accounting for this error and adjustment, KWR has the fewest pending applications, and is therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 55. 45. Group 63. This group consists of three applications proposing service to the same community in Georgia. Inverse Focus Ministry, Inc. IFM, Frequency Zero, Inc. FZI, and Sanctuary Church SC each proposes to serve Darien. Because each applicant proposes to serve the same community, the three applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 46. SC claims that it qualifies for three points as an established local applicant IFM and FZI do not claim points under this criterion. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership with SCs claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station WWZR-LP, Brunswick, Georgia. No applicant claims that it qualifies for points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, IFMs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,018 square kilometers with a population of 59,210. FZIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 348 square kilometers with a population of 36,249. SCs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 667 square kilometers with a population of 54,575. No applicant is eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than another. Accordingly, SC is credited with a total of five 67 See File Nos. 166667, 166680, 166720, 166738, 167098, 167113, and 167131. 68 See File Nos. 166667, 166680, 166720, 166738, 167098, 167113, and 167131. 801 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 points, and IFM and FZI are each credited with two points. SC is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 63. 47. Group 79. This group consists of seven applications proposing service to four different communities in Iowa. Friendship Baptist Church FBC, Bible Broadcasting Network, Inc. BBN, Community Public Radio, Inc. CPR, and Calvary Chapel Iowa CCI each proposes to serve Cedar Rapids. Rising Tide Broadcasting, Inc. RTB proposes to serve Center Point. Vida Ministry Inc. VM proposes to serve Marion, and Extend the Dream Foundation EDF proposes to serve Swisher. Each applicant certifies that it is not eligible for a fair distribution preference, and accordingly, all seven applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 48. FBC, CCI, and EDF each claims that it qualifies for three points as an established local applicant. BBN, CPR, RTB, and FM do not claim points under this criterion. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership with CCIs claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station KEWR-LP, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and EDFs claim based on a pledge to divest KICI-LP, Iowa City, Iowa. No applicant claims that it qualifies for points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, the applicants proposed 60 dBu contours would encompass areas and populations as follows FBC, 1,598 square kilometers with a population of 207,189 BBN, 1,551 square kilometers with a population of 205,737 CPR, 4,034 square kilometers with a population of 250,043 CCI, 2,008 square kilometers with a population of 217,630 RTB, 2,011 square kilometers with a population of 211,469 VM, 2,685 square kilometers with a population of 231,036 and EDF, 2,846 square kilometers with a population of 230,891. No applicant is eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than the next best proposal. Accordingly, FBC, CCI, and EDF are each credited with a total of five points BBN, CPR, RTB, and VM are each credited with two points. FBC, CCI, and EDF, therefore, proceed to a tie-breaker analysis. 49. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. Each applicant certifies that it has no attributable interest in any radio authorization.69 Accordingly, FBC, CCI, and EDF proceed to the second tie-breaker  the number of pending radio applications attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest applications prevails. FBC and EDF each certifies it has one pending application, and CCI certifies it has no pending applications. Applicants, however, were required to count the application at issue when reporting their pending applications. Therefore, one pending application is the lowest possible number of pending applications that can be specified correctly on the Schedule 340.70 With this adjustment, FBC, CCI, and EDF remain tied and proceed to a third tie-breaker - prior NCE applications. 50. The tentative selectee will be the applicant that can demonstrate that 1 it applied in a previous filing window, and had its application accepted for filing and processed, but subsequently dismissed in favor of an applicant possessing superior points or a tie-breaker showing 2 it was in continuous existence as a legal entity at all times from the date of the previous NCE window filing until the present and 3 it does not hold any NCE construction permit or license. No applicant certifies that it satisfies this final tie-breaker criterion. Accordingly, FBC, CCI, and EDF are all the tentative selectees 69 CCI and EDF pledge to divest their current LPFM stations, and accordingly, were not required to count these stations as existing authorizations. See Schedule 340, Point SystemTie-breakers Section, Existing Authorizations \"Radio applicants should count all attributable full service radio stations, AM and FM, commercial and noncommercial, and FM translator stations other than fill-in stations or those identified in the second question pledge to divest an attributable broadcast interestresign from an attributable positional interest under Diversity of Ownership. 70 See NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice, supra note 24 When reporting pending applications, applicants must include new and major change radio applications, including the subject application and all other applications filed in this window by the Application Deadline.. 802 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 for Group 79, and, we direct the applicants to submit, within 90 days of the release of the Order, a voluntary time-sharing agreement. 51. Group 83.71 This group consists of two applications proposing service to the same community in Idaho. First Baptist Church of Riverview FBCR and Salt  Light Radio, Inc. SLRI each proposes to serve Mountain Home. Because the applicants propose service to the same community, FBCR and SLRI proceed to a point system analysis. 52. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network. Each applicant certifies that it is entitled to two points for diversity of ownership. With respect to technical parameters, FBCRs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,815 square kilometers with a population of 25,104. SLRIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,809 square kilometers with a population of 23,846. Because neither applicants proposal would serve at least 10 more area and population than the other, we do not award points for this criterion. Accordingly, FBCR and SLRI are each credited with two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis. 53. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. FBCR certifies that it has attributable interests in seven radio authorizations, and SLRI certifies that it has five radio attributable interests. Accordingly, SLRI is the tentative selectees in Group 83. 54. Group 92. This group consists of four applications to serve different communities in Illinois and Indiana. Covenant Network CN and 2820 Communications Inc. 2820 each proposes to serve Danville, Illinois. Appalachian Educational Communication Corporation AECC proposes to serve Paris, Illinois, and Olivet Nazarene University ONU proposes to serve Wingate, Indiana. Each applicant certifies that it is not eligible for a fair distribution preference, and accordingly, all four applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 55. No applicant claims that it qualifies for points as an established local applicant or state- wide network. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership. However, because CN and 2820 did not submit documentation to support this claim, we cannot award either applicant points under this criterion.72 With respect to technical parameters, CNs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 402 square kilometers with a population of 16,197. 2820s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 2,375 square kilometers with a population of 85,330. AECCs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,272 square kilometers with a population of 18,443. ONUs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,620 square kilometers with a population of 35,227. 2820 is eligible for two points under the 71 Group 83 was analyzed in a previous point system order, and First Baptist Church of Riverview FBCR was declared the tentative selectee. See Comparative Consideration of 32 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, FCC 22-78 rel. Oct. 25, 2022. On November 1, 2022, FBCR notified Bureau staff that it had prepared an amendment to update its count of existing authorizations to reflect recent grants and assignments, all of which had occurred prior to the October 25, 2022, release of the point order, but inadvertently neglected to file the amendment. Therefore, on November 1, 2022, FBCR concurrently filed its amendment to update its count of existing authorizations. On November 25, 2022, Salt  Light Radio, Inc. filed a petition to deny the FBCR application SLRI Petition, asserting that FBCRs recent amendment changes the result of the previous point system analysis and had the information now available to the agency staff been before the staff when the Order was released 30 days ago, the staff would have tentatively selected Salt  Lights competing application. See Pleading No. 204286. FBCR did not file an opposition to the SLRI Petition. The initial tentative selection of the FBCR application was an interlocutory decision, not a final action on the two applications in Group 83, and therefore, can be modified or rescinded when, as the case here, new facts arise which demonstrate the tentative selection was made without accurate data, and therefore, wrong. We, therefore, re-analyze Group 83 herein and dismiss the SLRI Petition as moot. 72 CN and 2820 each hold attributable interests in Illinois andor nearby states. Each applicant neglected to submit a statement that there is no overlap with the proposed station. 803 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 best technical proposal criterion because it proposes to serve at least 25 more area and population than each other applicant. Accordingly, CN is not credited with any points. 2820, AECC, and ONU are each credited with two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis. 56. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. 2820 certifies that it has an attributable interest in nine radio authorizations, AECC in five, and ONU in seven. Accordingly, AECC is the tentative selectee for Group 92. 57. Group 106. This group consists of two applications proposing service to the same community in Rhode Island. Radio Sharon Foundation RSF and Horizon Christian Fellowship HCF each proposes to serve Narragansett Pier. Because the applicants propose to serve the same community, RSF and HCF proceed to a point system analysis. 58. RSF certifies that it is entitled to three points as an established local applicant. HCF does not claim points under this criterion. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership. Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, RSFs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 203 square kilometers with a population of 49,310 people. HCFs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 976 square kilometers with a population of 59,822 people. HCF is eligible for one point under the best technical proposal criterion because it proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than RSF. Accordingly, RSF is credited with a total of five points, and HCF is credited with a total of three points. Thus, RSF is the tentative selectee in Group 106. 59. Group 124. This group consists of six applications to serve different communities in Minnesota. Southern Minnesota Catholic Radio has two applications in the group, one for Mankato SMCR-Mankato and one for Waseca SMCR-Waseca. The other applicants are Minnesota State University, Mankato MSUM, One Day Church Project, Inc. ODCPI, and Fairmont Area Catholic Radio FACR, each for Mankato and Minn-Iowa Christian Broadcasting Inc. MICBI for Mapleton. No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, the six applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 60. MSUM and MICBI each claim three points as an established local applicant. The other four applicants do not claim points under this criterion. ODCPI, SMCR-Mankato, FACR, and SMCR- Waseca each claim two points for diversity of ownership, with ODCPIs claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station KCJL-LP, Dodge Center, Minnesota, and with FACRs claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station KYEJLP, Fairmont, Minnesota. MSUM and MICBI do not claim diversity points. No applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, each applicants proposed 60 dBu contours would encompass areas and populations as follows MSUM, 4,352 square kilometers with a population of 120,672 ODCPI, 4,951 square kilometers with a population of 133,200 SMCR-Mankato, 755 square kilometers with a population of 70,902 FACR, 1,104 square kilometers with a population of 76,602 MICBI, 756 square kilometers with a population of 6,485 and SMCR- Waseca, 617 square kilometers with a population of 25,524. ODCPI is credited with one point under the best technical proposal criterion because its proposal will serve at least 10 more area and population than MSUMs next best proposal. Accordingly, SMCR-Mankato, FACR, and SMCR-Waseca are each credited with a total of two points MSUM, MICBI, and ODCPI are each credited with a total of three points and therefore proceed to the tie-breaker analysis. 61. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. MSUM certifies that it has attributable interests in three radio authorizations. MICBI certifies that it has attributable interests in 25 radio authorizations, and ODCPI certifies it has no attributable radio authorizations. ODCPI therefore prevails based on this first tie-breaker and is the tentative selectee in Group 124. 804 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 62. Group 137B.73 This group consists of three applications to serve different communities in North Carolina. Hitquake Community Radio Network HCRN proposes to serve Glencoe. Church Planters of America CPA proposes to serve McLeansville, and Hispanic American Christian Network, Inc. HACNI proposes to serve Sedalia. No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, the three applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 63. No applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership. With respect to technical parameters, HCRNs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 129 square kilometers with a population of 31,147. CPAs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 305 square kilometers with a population of 47,401. HACNI did not provide information regarding its proposed 60 dBu contour or population served, and is therefore not included in our analysis for the best technical proposal. CPA qualifies for two points as the best technical proposal because it proposes to serve at least 25 more area and population than the HCRN proposal. Accordingly, HCRN and HACNI are each credited with two points. CPA is credited with a total of four points, and is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 137B. 64. Group 137C.74 This group consists of three applications to serve the same community in Virginia. Positive Alternative Radio, Inc. PARI, Church Planters of America CPA, and Hitquake Community Radio Network HCRN all propose to serve Danville. Because each applicant proposes to serve the same community, the three applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 65. No applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network. CPA and HCRN each claim two points for diversity of ownership PARI does not. With respect to technical parameters, PARIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 351 square kilometers with a population of 59,098. CPAs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 665 square kilometers with a population of 60,139. HCRNs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 813 square kilometers with a population of 72,547. HCRN qualifies for one point under the best technical proposal criterion because its proposal would serve at least 10 more area and population than CPAs next best proposal. Accordingly, PARI is not credited with any points, CPA is credited with two points, and HCRN is credited with a total of three points. HCRN is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 137C. 66. Group 144. This group consists of four applications to serve different communities in New Jersey. Radio Vision Cristiana Management Corporation RVCMC proposes to serve Brick. Rejuvenation Outreach Center Inc. ROCI and Community Public Radio, Inc. CPRI each proposes to serve Lakewood. Cantico Nuevo Ministry, Inc. CNMI proposes to serve Leisure Village. No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, the four applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 67. CNMI claims three points as an established local applicant, but did not submit documentation to support its claim. Accordingly, we will not award CNMI the three localism points. RVCMC, ROCI, and CPRI do not claim points under this criterion. RVCMC, ROCI, and CPRI claim two points for diversity of ownership CNMI does not. CNMI claims two points as a state-wide network, but did not submit documentation to support its claim. Accordingly, we will not award CNMI the two points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, RVCMCs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 520 square kilometers with a population of 392,195. ROCIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 113 square kilometers with a population of 126,118.75 CPRIs proposed 60 73 Group 137, which originally consisted of 16 applications, was divided into three sub-groups as a result of a technical amendment. Groups 137B and 137C are evaluated herein. The applications in Group 137A were evaluated in a previous order. See 13 Group Fair Distribution Order, supra note 63. 74 See supra note 73. 75 On December 23, 2021, ROCI amended its application to increase its proposed area to 116.5 square kilometers and its proposed population to 130,531. Because the amendment was filed after the close of the filing window, we continued. 805 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 dBu contour would encompass 534 square kilometers with a population of 396,270. CNMIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 173 square kilometers with a population of 128,350. No applicant is eligible for any points under the best technical proposal criterion because no proposal will serve at least 10 more area and population than the next best proposal. Accordingly, CNMI is not credited with any points RVCMC, ROCI, and CPRI are each credited with two points and proceed to the tie-breaker analysis. 68. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. RVCMC certifies that it has attributable interests in five radio authorizations. ROCI certifies that it has no attributable radio interests. CPRI certifies that it has attributable interests in one radio authorization. ROCI therefore prevails based on this first tie-breaker and is the tentative selectee in Group 144. 69. Group 145. This group consists of five applications to serve different communities in New Jersey. Casa de Destino CDD and Calvary Chapel Morris Hills CCMH each proposes to serve Bernardsville Redeemer Broadcasting, Inc. RBI proposes to serve Mendham Transmission Communications Network TCN proposes to serve Millington and Cantico Nuevo Ministry, Inc. CNM proposes to serve Watchung. CDD, CCMH, and RBI each claim eligibility for a fair distribution preference.76 TCN and CNM do not claim eligibility for a fair distribution preference. Although CDD certifies that it is eligible for a fair distribution preference, it failed to timely provide sufficient documentation to support its claim in its original application.77 Accordingly, TCN, CNM, and CDD are each eliminated. CCMH claims to provide new first NCE service to 36,190 people RBI to 38,643 people. The proposals of CCMH and RBI are comparable because neither proposal exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people. Accordingly, we consider combined first and second NCE service population totals. CCMH would provide a first or second NCE service to 83,722 people 36,190 first service plus 47,532 second service RBI to 88,378 people 38,643 first service plus 49,735 second service. Because the CCMH and RBI applications are still comparable, CCMH and RBI proceed to a point system analysis. 70. CCMH claims three points as an established local applicant RBI does not. Both CCMH and RBI claim two points for diversity of ownership, with CCMHs claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station WCFT-LP, Dover, New Jersey. Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, CCMHs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 431 square kilometers with a population of 177,699. RBIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 457 square kilometers with a population of 157,527. Because neither applicants proposal would serve at least 10 more area and population than the other, we do not award points for this criterion. Accordingly, CCMH do not consider it. We have repeatedly disallowed the enhancement of qualifications in NCE comparative cases, consistent with section 73.7003e of the rules. See 47 CFR 73.7003e. 76 See File Nos. 167880, 167028, and 166759, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits. CDDs 60 dBu contour encompasses 134,947 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 75,634 people. CCMHs 60 dBu contour encompasses 177,699 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 83,722 people. RBIs 60 dBu contour encompasses 157,527 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 88,378 people. Thus, each applicant would provide a combined first and second NCE service to at least 10 of the population within its 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people. 77 See File No. 167880, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits. In CDDs original application, submitted on November 9, 2021, it did not certify that it would provide a first or second NCE service, nor did it attach the required documentation. CDD submitted an amendment to the original application on January 24, 2022, that corrects the fair distribution of service certifications and supplies the required supporting documentation. Id. We find that CDDs amended application, which claimed fair distribution preference for the first time, was a prohibited attempt to enhance its comparative position, and will therefore not be considered. 806 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 is credited with a total of five points, and RBI is credited with a total of two points. CCMH is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 145.78 71. Group 153. This group consists of three applications to serve the same community in New Mexico. Off the Cuff Educational Broadcasting OTCEB, City of Hobbs, NM CHN, and The Association for Community Education, Inc. AFCEI all propose to serve Hobbs. Because each applicant proposes to serve the same community, the three applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 72. CHN claims three points as an established local applicant OTCEB and AFCEI do not claim localism points. CHN and AFCEI each claim two points for diversity of ownership, with CHNs claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station KHBX-LP, Hobbs, New Mexico. OTCEB does not claim points under this criterion. No applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, OTCEBs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 484 square kilometers with a population of 34,628. CHNs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,304 square kilometers with a population of 44,280. AFCEIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 495 square kilometers with a population of 42,589. No applicant is eligible for any points under the best technical proposal criterion because no proposal will serve at least 10 more area and population than the next best proposal. Accordingly, OTCEB is not credited with any points, CHN is credited with five points, and AFCEI is credited with two points. CHN is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 153. 73. Group 156. This group consists of three applications proposing service to the same community in New Mexico. Northern New Mexico Radio Foundation NMRF, The Association for Community Education, Inc. ACE, and The Rock Christian Outreach of Las Vegas RCLV each proposes to serve Las Vegas. Because the applicants propose service to the same community, NMRF, ACE, and RCLV proceed to a point system analysis. 74. RCLV claims it qualifies for three points as an established local applicant. NMRF and ACE do not claim points under this criterion. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership, with RCLVs claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station KLYN-LP, Las Vegas, New Mexico. No applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, NMRFs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 339 square kilometers with a population of 18,311. ACEs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 548 square kilometers with a population of 18,938. RCLVs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 390 square kilometers with a population of 18,476. No applicant qualifies for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to serve least 10 more area and population than the next best proposal. Accordingly, RCLV is credited with a total of five points. NMRF and ACE are each credited with two points. Thus, RCLV is the tentative selectee in Group 156. 75. Group 174. This group consists of two applications proposing service to the same community in Oklahoma. Woodward Catholic Radio, Inc. WCR and Great Plains Christian Radio, Inc. GPCR each proposes to serve Woodward. Because the applicants propose to serve the same community, WCR and GPCR proceed to a point system analysis. 76. WCR claims that it qualifies for three points as an established local applicant. GPCR does not claim points under this criterion. WCR also claims two points for diversity of ownership based on its pledge to divest LPFM station, KFPP-LP, Woodward, Oklahoma. GPCR does not claim diversity points. Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, WCRs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,248 square kilometers with a population of 17,400. 78 On January 7, 2022, RBI filed an Informal Objection to the CCMHs application. See Pleading No. 179137. We generally do not consider objections at this stage, but rather, review the merits of any objection ifwhen the subject application becomes accepted for filing. We will review the merits of RBIs objection after the tentative selectees application is accepted for filing. 807 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 GPCRs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,212 square kilometers with a population of 18,652. Neither applicant is eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because neither proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than the other. Accordingly, WCR is credited with a total of five points, and GPCR is not credited with any points. WCR is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 174. 77. Group 177. This group consists of three applications to serve three different communities in Oklahoma. Outside the Doors Ministry Foundation ODMF proposes to serve Altus, Western Oklahoma Catholic Faith Foundation WOCF proposes to serve Elk City, and Top O' Texas Educational Broadcasting Foundation, Inc. TEBF proposes to serve Sayre. No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference.79 ODMF, WOCF, and TEBF, therefore, proceed to a point system analysis. 78. WOCF claims it qualifies for three points as an established local applicant. ODMF and TEBF do not claim points under this criterion. ODMF and WOCF each claim two points for diversity of ownership, with WOCFs claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station KPFSLP, Elk City, Oklahoma. TEBF certifies that it is not entitled to diversity points. ODMF also claims points as a state- wide network. Such points, however, are only available to applicants that do not qualify for two points for diversity of ownership. ODMF cannot claim points under both criteria.80 With respect to technical parameters, ODMFs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 985 square kilometers with a population of 26,084. WOCFs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 4,419 square kilometers with a population of 23,870. TEBFs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 2,176 square kilometers with a population of 8,115. No applicant qualifies for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than the next best proposal. Accordingly, ODMF is credited with a total of two points, WOCF is credited with five points, and TEBF is not credited with any points. Thus, WOCF is the tentative selectee in Group 177. 79. Group 181. This group consists of two applications to serve the same community in Oregon. Coos Commons Protection Council CCPC and Southern Oregon University SOU each propose to serve Bandon. Because each applicant proposes to serve the same community, the applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 80. CCPC and SOU each claim three points as an established local applicant. CCPC and SOU also each claim two points for diversity of ownership. SOU certifies that its diversity claim is based on a divestiture pledge, but it neglects to provide such a pledge or submit any information to support its claim. Accordingly, we will not award SOU points under this criterion. Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, CCPCs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,410 square kilometers with a population of 11,439. SOUs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,306 square kilometers with a population of 11,040. Because neither applicants proposal would serve at least 10 more area and population than the other, we do not award points for this 79 See File No. 167817, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits. In its initial application, WOCF claimed eligibility for a fair distribution preference based on first and second NCE service population totals and was named the tentative selectee of Group 177. See Threshold Fair Distribution Analysis of 19 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 22-314 MB Mar. 24, 2022. On April 22, 2022, WOCF filed an amendment to its application to disclaim its eligibility for a fair distribution preference. The initial tentative selection of the WOCF application was an interlocutory decision, not a final action on the three applications in Group 177, and therefore, can be modified or rescinded when, as the case here, facts arise which nullify the previous fair distribution analysis. In any event, WOCF remains the tentative selectee based on application of the established criteria as outlined above. 80 See 47 CFR  73.7003b3. Moreover, ODMF does not submit any information to support its claim that it qualifies as a state-wide network. 808 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 criterion. Accordingly, CCPC is credited with a total of five points, and SOU is credited with a total of three points. CCPC is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 181. 81. Group 184. This group consists of three applications proposing service to the same community in Oregon. First Baptist Church of Riverview FBCR, Idaho Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists, Inc. ICSA, and Baker Art Guild BAG each proposes to serve Baker City. Because the applicants propose service to the same community, FBCR, ICSA, and BAG proceed to a point system analysis. 82. ICSA and BAG each claim three points as an established local applicant. FBCR does not claim points under this criterion. FBCR and BAG claim two points each for diversity of ownership ICSA does not. No applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, FBCRs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 507 square kilometers with a population of 10,865. ICSAs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 562 square kilometers with a population of 11,985. BAGs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,307 square kilometers with a population of 13,193. BAG qualifies for one point under the best technical proposal criterion because its proposal would serve at least 10 more area and population than ICSAs next best proposal. Accordingly, BAG is credited with a total of six points, ICSA is credited with three points, and FBCR is credited with two points. BAG is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 184. 83. Group 185. This group consists of two applications to serve the same community in Oregon. Ondas de Vida, Inc. ODVI and Modoc Broadcasting Corporation MBC each proposes to serve Altamont. Because the applicants propose to serve the same community, ODVI and MBC proceed to a point system analysis. 84. MBC claims three points as an established local applicant ODVI does not. ODVI and MBC each claim two points for diversity of ownership. ODVI, however, certifies that it has 10 existing authorizations and does not submit documentation to support its diversity claim.81 Accordingly, we will not award ODVI points under this criterion. Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, ODVIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 162 square kilometers with a population of 37,281. MBCs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 2,833 square kilometers with a population of 26,633. Because neither applicants proposal would serve at least 10 more area and population than the other, we do not award points for this criterion. Accordingly, ODVI is not credited with any points, and MBC is credited with a total of five points. MBC is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 185. 85. Group 192. This group consists of two applications to serve the same community in Texas. Hallettsville Right to Life, Inc. HRLI and Vida Ministry Inc. VMI each proposes to serve Hallettsville. Because HRLI and VMI propose to serve the same community, the applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 86. HRLI claims three points as an established local applicant VMI does not. HRLI and VMI each claim two points for diversity of ownership. Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, HRLIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,541 square kilometers with a population of 27,122. VMIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,752 square kilometers with a population of 13,792. Neither applicant qualifies for any points under the best technical proposal criterion because neither proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than the other. Accordingly, HRLI is credited with a total of five points, and VMI is credited with two points. HRLI is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 192. 81 We note that even if we were to award ODVI points for diversity of ownership, it would not change the outcome of this group. 809 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 87. Group 198. This group consists of two applications to serve the same community in Texas. Vida Ministry Inc. VMI and Ixoye Productions, Inc. IPI each proposes to serve Thorndale. Because VMI and IPI propose to serve the same community, the applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 88. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network. VMI and IPI each claim two points for diversity of ownership. With respect to technical parameters, VMIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 440 square kilometers with a population of 3,462. IPIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 150 square kilometers with a population of 2,129. VMI qualifies for two points as the best technical proposal because it proposes to serve at least 25 more area and population than the IPI proposal. Accordingly, VMI is credited with a total of four points, and IPI is credited with two points. VMI is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 198. 89. Group 200. This group consists of four applications proposing service to three different communities in Texas. Call Communications Group, Inc. CCGI proposes to serve Beaumont. Vida Ministry Inc. VMI proposes to serve Central Gardens. Christian Ministries of the Valley, Inc. CMV and CCS Radio, Inc. CCSR each proposes to serve Port Arthur. No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, the four applicants proceed to a point system analysis. 90. No applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network. CCGI and VMI each claim two points for diversity of ownership. CMV and CCSR do not claim points under this criterion. With respect to technical parameters, CCGIs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,157 square kilometers with a population of 218,225 VMI, 539 square kilometers and 114,876 people CMV, 1,882 square kilometers and 221,770 people and CCSR, 1,402 square kilometers and 108,218 people. No applicant qualifies for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than the next best proposal. Accordingly, CMV and CCSR are not credited with any points. CCGI and VMI are each credited with a total of two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis. 91. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. VMI certifies that it has no attributable interests in any radio authorization, and CCGI certifies that it has attributable interests in nine radio authorizations. VMI therefore prevails based on this first tie- breaker and is the tentative selectee in Group 200. 92. Group 201. This group consists of five applications to serve five different communities in Texas. Radio Inc. RI proposes to serve Ballinger. The other applicants are La Promesa Foundation LPF for Brady Hispanic American Christian Network, Inc. HACN for El Dorado Sun Radio Foundation SRF for Mason and Centro Cristiano de Vida Eterna San Antonio CCSA for Rock Springs. LPF and CCSA each claim eligibility for a first NCE service fair distribution preference. 82 RI, HACN, and SRF do not claim eligibility for a first NCE service fair distribution preference. Accordingly, RI, HACN, and SRF are each eliminated. We note that Albert David David filed an Informal Objection Objection to the CCSA application,83 asserting that CCSAs population figures in support of its fair distribution claim are unreliable because it failed to consider NCE FM stations KKERFM, Kerrville, Texas, and KTXIFM, Ingram, Texas. CCSA, however, amended its application to account for these 82 See File Nos. 167328 and 167127, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits. LPF claims that it would provide first NCE service to 6,907 of the 6,907 people encompassed within its 60 dBu contour, and CCSA to 5,470 of the 5,529 people. Thus, each applicant would provide first NCE service to at least 10 of the population within its 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people. 83 See Pleading No. 184828 filed February 15, 2022. We generally do not consider objections at this stage, but rather, review the merits of any objection ifwhen the subject application becomes accepted for filing. Here, we dismiss Davids Objection to the CCSA application as moot because CCSA amended its application to correct and update its population data in response to the Objection. 810 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 stations and correct and update its population data.84 Accordingly, we dismiss the David Objection as moot.85 93. LPF claims to provide new first NCE service to 6,907 people, and CCSA to 5,470 people. The applications are comparable because neither exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people. Accordingly, we consider combined first and second NCE service population totals. LPF claims to provide combined first and second service to 6,907 people all first service CCSA to 5,483 5,470 first service plus 13 second service. The applications are still comparable, and therefore, LPF and CCSA proceed to a point system analysis. 94. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network. LPF and CCSA each claim two points for diversity of ownership. With respect to technical parameters, LPFs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,468 square kilometers with a population of 6,907. CCSAs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 6,518 square kilometers with a population of 5,529. Because neither applicants proposal would serve at least 10 more area and population than the other, we do not award points for this criterion. Accordingly, LPF and CCSA are each credited with a total of two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis. 95. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. LPF certifies that it has attributable interests in 32 radio authorizations, and CCSA certifies that it has attributable interests in ten radio authorizations. CCSA therefore prevails based on this first tie- breaker and is the tentative selectee in Group 201. 96. Group 206. This group consists of two applications to serve the same community in Utah. Castle Valley Inc. CVI and University of Utah UU each propose to serve Moab. Because the applicants proposes to serve the same community, CVI and UU proceed to a point system analysis. 97. CVI and UU each claim three points as an established local applicant, but CVI does not submit documentation to support its claim. Accordingly, we will not award CVI points under this criterion.86 CVI and UU each claim two points for diversity of ownership with CVIs claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station KCVD-LP, Castle Valley, Utah and UUs claim based on a pledge to divest FM translator stations K219KR, Moab, Utah, and K215EL, North Moab, Utah. Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, UUs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 4,995 square kilometers with a population of 9,850. CVIs proposed 60 dBu contour would include a population of 8,379. CVI does not provide information regarding its proposed area served. To allow us to compare the proposals, and not unfairly disadvantage UU, we will only consider the proposed population served. We therefore award UU one point under the best technical 84 See File No. 167127 amended February 16, 2022 see also CCSA Opposition to Objection, Pleading No. 189092 filed April 8, 2022. CCSAs amendment reduced its first NCE service population count from 5,529 to 5,470 people. 85 In his Reply to CCSAs Opposition, David acknowledges that CCSA corrected the population figures and states that he does not object to the amended figures being used in a determination of a fair distribution preference. See Pleading No. 189432 filed April 18, 2022. David, however, argues that the initial inaccurate figures appears to qualify as a willful false statement, and the subsequent correction does not appear to nullify what was committed in the first place. Id. We disagree. Although it is undisputed that CCSA made a mistake in its initial population count, a mistake standing alone is not a misrepresentation. In this case, there is no evidence of any intent to deceive. See, e.g., Fox River Broadcasting, Order, 93 FCC 23 127 1983. 86 We note that even if we were to award CVI points as an established local applicant, it would not change the outcome of this group. 811 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 proposal criterion because it proposes to serve at least 10 more population than the CVI proposal.87 Accordingly, UU is credited with a total of six points, and CVI is credited with a total of two points. UU is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 206. 98. Group 219. This group consists of three applications proposing service to two different communities in Washington. Iglesia Case de Milagros ICM proposes to serve Leavenworth. Upper Columbia Mission Society of Seventh-Day Adventists UPMS and First Baptist Church of Riverview FBC each proposes to serve Wenatchee. No applicant claims a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, ICM, UPMS and FBC proceed to a point system analysis. 99. UPMS claims three points as an established local applicant ICM and FBC do not claim points under this criterion. Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership. No applicant claims points as a state-wide network. With respect to technical parameters, ICMs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,666 square kilometers with a population of 72,249. UPMSs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 294 square kilometers with a population of 67,368. FBCs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 172 square kilometers with a population of 64,836. No applicant is eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than the next best proposal. Thus, UPMS is credited with a total of five points, and ICM and FBC are each credited with two points. Accordingly, UPMS is the tentative selectee in Group 219. 100. Group 220. This group consists of two applications to serve different communities in Washington. Iglesia Casa de Milagros ICM proposes to serve Chelan, and Northwest Communities Education Center NCEC proposes to serve Manson. Neither applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference. Accordingly, ICM and NCEC proceed to a point system analysis. 101. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network. ICM and NCEC claim two points each for diversity of ownership. With respect to technical parameters, ICMs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 817 square kilometers with a population of 10,451. NCECs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 993 square kilometers with a population of 13,307. NCEC qualifies for one point as the best technical proposal because it proposes to serve at least 10 more area and population than the ICM proposal. Accordingly, ICM is credited with two points, and NCEC is credited with a total of three points. NCEC is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 220. 102. Group 223. This group consists of eight applications to serve different communities in Wisconsin. The Salvation Poem Foundation, Inc. SPF proposes to serve Cedar Grove. Call Communications Group, Inc. Call proposes to serve Eden. Educational Media Foundation EMF proposes to serve Fond Du Lac. State of Wisconsin - Educational Communications Board State proposes to serve Plymouth. Vanguard Association of Sunbelt Colleges Corporation Vanguard proposes to serve Rosendale. Immanuel Bible Church Immanuel proposes to serve Sheboygan. Finally, Waupun Baptist Church Waupun and Wrvm, Inc. WRVM each proposes to serve Waupun. SPF, Vanguard, and WRVM each claims eligibility for a fair distribution of service preference based on first NCE service population totals.88 The other applicants do not. Accordingly, Call, EMF, State, Immanuel, and Waupun are each eliminated. SPF would provide a first NCE service to 2,929 people Vanguard to 18,092 people and WRVM to 19,906 people. Because Vanguard and WRVM would each provide a first 87 We note that even if, due to CVIs incomplete application, we did not compare the proposals and award points under the best technical proposal criterion, it would not change the outcome of the group. UU would remain the tentative selectee for Group 206. 88 See File Nos. 167767, 167734, and 166135, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits. SPF claims that it would provide a first NCE service to 2,929 of the 27,330 people within its proposed 60 dBu contour Vanguard to 18,092 of the 163,678 people and WRVM to 19,906 of the 170,548 people within its proposed 60 dBu contour. Thus, each applicant would provide first NCE service to at least 10 of the population within its 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people. 812 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 NCE service to at least 5,000 more people than SPF, SPF is eliminated. The Vanguard and WRVM first service proposals are comparable because neither exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people. Accordingly, we consider combined first and second NCE service population totals. Vanguard would provide a first or second NCE service to 69,122 people 18,092 first service plus 51,030 second service WRVM to 72,677 people 19,906 first service plus 52,771 second service. Because neither proposal exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people, Vanguard and WRVM procced to the point system analysis. 103. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network. Vanguard and WRVM each claim two points for diversity of ownership. With respect to technical parameters, Vanguards proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,324 square kilometers with a population of 163,678 people. WRVMs proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,963 square kilometers with a population of 170,548 people. Because neither applicants proposal would serve at least 10 more area and population than the other, we do not award points for this criterion. Accordingly, Vanguard and WRVM are each credited with two points and proceed to the tie-breaker analysis. 104. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails. Vanguard certifies that it has no attributable interests, and WRVM certifies that it has attributable interests in 30 radio authorizations. Vanguard is, therefore, the tentative selectee for Group 223.89 IV. NEXT STEPS 105. Acceptability Studies and Filing of Petitions. Once the Bureau or Commission identifies a tentative selectee pursuant to the fair distribution analysis or point system, the next step is to consider whether the selectees application has defects.90 The Commission has studied the application of each tentative selectee identified herein for application defects. Each tentative selectee identified in this Order and its Appendix appears to be fully qualified to become the licensee of the new NCE FM station it has proposed. We tentatively conclude that the grant of these applications would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. Accordingly, upon the release of this Order, the tentative selectees are accepted for filing. This triggers a 30-day period for the filing of petitions to deny.91 106. Any argument that the tentatively selected application should not be granted should be raised in such a petition, even if the objection relates only indirectly to the tentative selectees qualifications. For example, an applicant that concedes that the tentative selectee is qualified for the points received but believes its own proposal should have received a greater number of points than the tentative selectees would make its argument in a petition to deny. Likewise a disappointed applicant that believes the tentative selectee should have received fewer points would make such an argument in a petition to deny. Parties should not raise such matters as petitions for reconsideration of the instant Order 89 On December 15, 2021, Call filed an Informal Objection to Vanguards application, and on January 11, 2022, WRVM filed a Petition to Deny the Vanguard application. See Pleading Nos. 177311 and 179670. We generally do not consider objections at this stage, but rather, review the merits of any objection ifwhen the subject application becomes accepted for filing. We will review the merits of Call and WRVMs pleadings after Vanguards application is accepted for filing. 90 If a tentative selectees application is found unacceptable for filing, it is dismissed. The applicant then has one opportunity to submit a curative amendment and a petition for reconsideration requesting reinstatement nunc pro tunc within 30 days, provided that the amendment is minor and does not alter the fair distribution analysis. See 47 CFR  73.3522b1. A tentative selectee that is unable to cure the defect is disqualified. 47 CFR  73.7004d. 91 47 CFR  73.7004. 813 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 because the point hearings herein take no final action on any application, and petitions for reconsideration do not lie against such interlocutory decisions.92 107. Forthcoming Staff Action. We direct the Bureau staff, once the petition to deny period has run, to conduct a final study of each tentatively selected application in accordance with its routine processing procedures. The staff studies should consider any petitions, comments, and objections to determine whether there is any substantial and material question of fact concerning whether grant of the tentatively selected application would serve the public interest. If the Bureau finds on the basis of the application, the pleadings filed, or other matters which it may officially notice that there are no substantial and material questions of fact, and that a grant of the application would be consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, it shall make the grant on the basis of the fair distribution analyses and point system determinations made herein, dismiss all competing applications, deny any petition to deny, and issue a concise statement of the reasons for denying such petition and disposing of all substantial issues raised by the petition.93 108. With the exception of issues that are novel or require Commission consideration as specified below, the staff shall act on the tentatively selected applications pursuant to delegated authority. We delegate to the staff authority to act on any routine matter that may be raised, including whether the applicant is eligible, as certified, for the points awarded herein, and whether the application complies with all relevant Commission rules and policies.94 The staff need not refer such matters to the full Commission unless the staff determines that the issues are new or novel, or raise a substantial and material question regarding the award of points. Generally, the staff should refer issues to the Commission where the exclusion or inclusion of challenged or claimed points could alter the outcome in the particular NCE group, or where a new or novel question or substantial and material question of fact otherwise exists.95 In such cases, the staff would refer the mutually exclusive group to the Commission for resolution of the novel issue andor the determination of a successor tentative selectee. 109. Severance for Purposes of Petitions, Appeals and Finality. We are including a provision in the ordering clauses herein that each decision involving a mutually exclusive group is to be considered distinct and separate for purposes of petitions to deny, petitions for reconsideration, review on the Commissions own motion, and appeals. The timing of any action disposing of a petition or appeal affecting a particular group will not delay the finality of our decision for purposes of administrative or judicial review under section 1.103b of our rules with respect to any other group.96 V. ORDERING CLAUSES 110. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, that each decision involving a mutually exclusive group in this Memorandum Opinion and Order shall be deemed a distinct and separate decision for purposes of petitions to deny, subsequent petitions for reconsideration and reconsideration by the Commission or 92 See NCE Order on Reconsideration, 35 FCC Rcd 10180, para. 13 A tentative selection is not final until the entire administrative process of resolving petitions to deny, and any subsequent pleadings, is complete 47 CFR  1.106 a1. See also Patrick J. Vaughn, Esq., Letter, 22 FCC Rcd 11165 MB 2007. 93 47 U.S.C.  309d. 94 See, e.g., Central Florida Educational Foundation, Inc., Letter, 23 FCC Rcd 1695 MB 2008 staff dismissal of defective application tentatively selected in a point hearing, and staff award of permit on a non-comparative basis to only remaining acceptable applicant. 95 See generally NCE Omnibus, 22 FCC Rcd at 6162, n.230 2007 If the Bureau finds that there are no new or novel questions, or material questions that would cause the tentative selectee to have fewer than or the same number of points as another applicant in the group, the staff would act on the petitions to deny, and by public notice grant the application of the tentative selectee and dismiss the competing mutually exclusive application. This function is consistent with the Bureaus delegated authority. See 47 C.F.R.  0.61h, 0.283.. 96 See 47 CFR  1.103b. 814 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5 Bureau on its own motion, applications for review and review on the Commissions own motion, and appeals.97 If any decision in this Memorandum Opinion and Order is declared invalid for any reason, the remaining portions shall be severable from the invalid part and SHALL REMAIN in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law. 111. Group 14. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, That the Application filed by Gentry Communications Network, Inc. File No. 167736 is TENTATIVELY SELECTED to be awarded a construction permit for a new NCE FM station in Sulphur Springs, Arkansas, and its application IS ACCEPTED FOR FILING, establishing a deadline thirty 30 days hereafter for the filing of petitions to deny. If, after the petition to deny period has run, the Bureau finds on the basis of the application, the pleadings filed, or other matters which it may officially notice that there is no substantial and material question concerning the grantability of the tentative selectees application, and it is determined that grant of the application serves the public interest, we direct the Media Bureau, by public notice, TO DISMISS the mutually exclusive applications of Centro Familiar de Restauracion y Vida File No. 167086 and Citizenship Tulsa, Inc.

INTRODUCTION 1. In this Order on Reconsideration, Second Report and Order, Order, and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we continue the Commissions efforts to improve the Rural Health Care RHC Program. The RHC Program supports rural health care providers with the costs of broadband and other communications services so that they can serve patients in rural areas that may have limited resources, fewer doctors, and higher rates for broadband and communications services than urban areas. Telehealth and telemedicine services, which expanded considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic, have also become essential tools for the delivery of health care to millions of rural Americans. These services bridge the vast geographic distances that separate health care facilities, enabling patients to receive high-quality medical care without sometimes lengthy or burdensome travel. The RHC Program promotes telehealth by providing financial support to eligible health care providers for broadband and telecommunications services. 2. In todays Order on Reconsideration, we address petitions for reconsideration of the 2019 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.1 We grant petitions challenging the database of urban and rural rates Rates Database for the Telecommunications Program Telecom Program established in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, return the Telecom Program to the rate determination rules in place before the adoption of the Rates Database, and deny petitions for reconsideration of other issues from the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order. In the Report and Order, we adopt proposals from the February 2022 Further Notice to amend RHC Program invoicing processes and the internal cap application and prioritization rules to promote efficiency, reduce delays in funding commitments, and prioritize support for the current funding year.2 In the Order, we dismiss as moot Applications for Review of the Commissions guidance to the Universal Service Administrative Company the Administrator regarding the Rates Database. Lastly, in the Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we propose revisions to the rate determination rules, seek comment on to reinstating the cap on support for satellite services, propose to make it easier for health care providers to receive RHC Program funding as soon as they become eligible, propose to align the deadline to request a Service Provider Identification Number SPIN change with the invoice filling deadline, and seek comment on revisions to data collected in the Telecom Program. II. BACKGROUND 3. The RHC Program consists of two component programs 1 the Telecom Program and 2 the Healthcare Connect Fund HCF Program. The Telecom Program was established in 1997 and 1 Promoting Telehealth in Rural America, WC Docket No. 17-310, Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd 7335 2019 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order. 2 Promoting Telehealth in Rural America, WC Docket No. 17-310, Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 22-15 Feb. 18, 2022 Further Notice. 828 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 subsidizes the difference between the rates in the health care providers rural area and rates for comparable services available in urban areas within that state.3 The HCF Program was created in 2012 to promote the use of broadband services and facilitate the formation of health care provider consortia that include both rural and urban health care providers4 by providing a flat 65 discount on an array of advanced telecommunications and information services.5 4. In August 2019, the Commission adopted the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, which included several reforms to RHC Program rules and procedures with the goals of ensuring transparency and consistency in the Program and simplifying the calculation of urban and rural rates used to determine the amount of support available to health care providers under the Telecom Program. Specifically, the Commission directed the Administrator to create the Rates Database and determined that the urban and rural rates would be the median of all rates for functionally similar services6 in the relevant state within the health care providers applicable rural area.7 Other significant reforms included new rules for prioritizing RHC Program support for rural areas in the event Program demand exceeds available funding,8 reforms to ensure competitive bidding is fair and open,9 and adopting Program-wide rules and procedures to simplify application processes and provide clarity regarding procedures.10 Alaska Communications the North Carolina Telehealth Network Association and Southern Ohio Health Care Network collectively, NCTNSOHCN the Schools, Health and Libraries Broadband Coalition SHLB the State of Alaska Office of the Governor and USTelecom  The Broadband Association USTelecom filed petitions for reconsideration seeking reconsideration of various aspects of the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.11 GCI Communication Corp. GCI and Alaska Communications subsequently filed 3 See 47 U.S.C.  254h1A Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, CC Docket No. 96-45, Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd 8776, 9093-161, paras. 608-749 1997 Universal Service First Report and Order. 4 See Rural Health Care Support Mechanism, WC Docket No. 02-60, Report and Order, 27 FCC Rcd 16678, 16680, paras. 1-2 2012 Healthcare Connect Fund Order. 5 See 47 U.S.C.  254h2A 47 CFR  54.611 Healthcare Connect Fund Order, 27 FCC Rcd at 16680-81, paras. 1-3. 6 The Commission instructed the Administrator to determine whether services are functionally similar based on a technology-agnostic inquiry from the perspective of the end user experience and specifically noted that rates used to determine the median rate should include rates for private carriage and information services. Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7345, para. 18. Section 54.605 of the Commissions rules directs applicants to use the lower of either the rural rate in the database or the rural rate included in a service agreement between the health care provider and the service provider. 47 CFR  54.605a. 7 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7372-73, para. 78 47 CFR  54.604a, 54.605a. Under the Commissions rules, the rurality tiers are defined as Less Rural, Rural, Extremely Rural, and Frontier. Less Rural areas are those that contain an urban area with a population of 25,000 or greater but are within a specific census tract that itself does not contain any part of a Place or Urban Area with a population of greater than 25,000. Rural areas are those that are within a Core Based Statistical Area that does not have an Urban Area with a population of 25,000 or greater. Extremely Rural areas are those that are entirely outside of a Core Based Statistical Area. Frontier areas are located in Alaska only, in areas outside of a Core Based Statistical Area that are inaccessible by road as determined by the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development, Division of Community and Regional Affairs.

Due to significant anomalies in the initial median urban and rural rate calculations in the Rates Database, the Bureau issued a series of waivers of the rules requiring use of the Rates Database through funding year 2023, initially for Alaska and subsequently for the entire United States.14 In lieu of the Rates Database, Program participants determined urban and rural rates using the rules that were in effect before the adoption of the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.15 Participants also had the option to use a rate that had previously been approved under those rules.16 6. In the Further Notice, we provided an overview of concerns about the Rates Database and sought comment on several issues related to determining support in the Telecom Program, including defining rurality, categorizing service technologies, various approaches to rate determination, and the potential transition period.17 We also sought comment on proposals to reform the RHC Programs internal cap on multi-year commitments and upfront payments, harmonize invoicing procedures, and sought general comment on additional steps to improve application processing, funding decisions, and appeals.18 III. ORDER ON RECONSIDERATION 7. In this Order on Reconsideration, we restore the mechanisms for calculating rural and urban rates that existed before adoption of the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order. We uphold the Promoting Telehealth Report and Orders rule changes regarding what services are similar to one another. We maintain the rurality tiers adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, which, due to the elimination of the Rates Database, now apply only to the prioritization of funding requests. We also keep the internal cap and funding prioritization systems and invoice certifications requirements from the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.

Rates Determination 8. As an initial matter, we grant in part petitions seeking reconsideration of the rules the Commission adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order to implement the Rates Database and restore the three methods for calculating rural rates in the Telecom Program. We deny petitions for reconsideration seeking review of clarifications and rules adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order regarding similar services and site and service substitution rules and dismiss as moot all remaining petitions related to the rules governing the Rates Database. 1. Urban and Rural Rates Determination Mechanism 9. We grant in part petitions seeking reconsideration of the adoption of the Rates Database in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order. We amend the current sections 54.504 and 54.505 of the Commissions rules to eliminate the use of the Rates Database to determine urban and rural rates and rescind the Commissions direction to the Administrator in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order to create the Rates Database.19 Based on the record before us, we find that reinstating the Commissions previous rules for calculating urban and rural rates, effective for RHC Program funding year 2024, is the best option for ensuring sufficient, reasonable rural and urban rates.20 10. Section 254h1A of the Communications Act requires that Telecom Program support must be based on the difference between the urban rate, which must be reasonably comparable to the rates charged for similar services in urban areas in that State, and rates for similar services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas, i.e., the rural rate. Because the Rates Database was deficient in its ability to set adequate rates, we find that restoration of the previous rural rate determination rules, which health care providers have continued to use to determine rural rates in recent funding years under the applicable Rates Database waivers,21 is the best available option pending further examination in the Second Further Notice, to ensure that healthcare providers have adequate, predictable support.22 11. Rural rates. We first find that the rural rates generated by the Rates Database could result in inadequate or inconsistent Telecom Program support for rural health care providers that undermines the goals of the Telecom Program. We agree with SHLB and the State of Alaskas general arguments that the Rates Database would not accurately reflect the costs of delivering telecommunications services and would not provide sufficient funding for most rural health care providers because the Rates Databases geographic rurality tiers were too broad and did not accurately represent the cost of serving dissimilar communities.23 The Commission created the rurality tiers to prevent median rates for more rural areas of a state from being unfairly reduced due to the inclusion of rates for similar services in less rural areas.24 This approach to rate determination was based on the reasonable assumption that the cost to provide telecommunications services increases as the density of an 19 See 47 CFR  54.504, 50.505 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7372-73, paras. 76-78. 20 Until 2019, these rules had been codified in section 54.607. Because that section number has since been re- assigned, the new rules for determining rural rates will replace the current section 54.605. 21 See Alaska Rates Database Waiver Order Nationwide Rates Database Waiver Order Alaska Rates Database Waiver Extension Nationwide Rates Database Extension Order. 22 The Bureau permitted the use of previously-approved rural rates in the waivers of the Rates Database. Nationwide Rates Database Waiver Order, at 7-8, para. 17. Because the rules we are restoring today did not allow for the use of previously-approved rural rates, this option will not be available to RHC Program participants. 23 SHLB Petition at 13-14 State of Alaska Petition at 4-5. Commenters responding to the Further Notice also argued that the Rates Database provided inadequate support for health care providers. See SHLB Comments at 5 SHLB Reply Comments at 7-8 Windstream Comments at 5-7 Alaska Communications Comments at 27 ANHB Comments at 7 GCI Comments at 5. We address arguments made in petitions for reconsideration that the Rates Database provided inadequate support and therefore do not address these comments. 24 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7351, para. 33. 831 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 area decreases, as rates are generally a function of population density.25 However, we find that in light of the significant anomalies in the Rates Database uncovered by the Bureau, including many situations where support amounts for more rural areas were less than those for less rural areas,26 the petitioners are correct that the geographic tiers used in the Rates Database do not result in rates that accurately reflect the cost of delivering telecommunications services for many rural health care providers.27 12. Under the rules we reinstate today, healthcare providers may use one of three methods for calculating the rural rates in the Telecom Program, depending on the circumstances 1 the average of rates that the carrier actually charges to other non-health care provider commercial customers for the same or similar services provided in the rural area where the health care provider is located Method 1 2 if the carrier does not have any commercial customers in the health care providers rural area, the average of tariffed and other publicly available rates charged by other service providers for the same or similar services provided over the same distance in the rural health care providers area Method 2 or 3 if there are no such rates or the carrier reasonably determines that those rates would be unfair, a cost- based rate that is approved by the Commission for interstate services or the relevant state commission for intrastate services Method 3.28 A carrier seeking approval of a rural rate under Method 3 will be required to provide a justification of the proposed rural rate that includes an itemization of the costs of providing the requested service.29 13. We reiterate the requirements previously associated with this methodology. Methods 1, 2, and 3 must be applied sequentially. Method 1 must be used to determine a rural rate unless the service provider selected is not actually charging non-health care provider customers rates for same or similar services in the rural area where the eligible health care provider is located.30 In that case, health care providers and service providers must attempt to calculate a rural rate using Method 2.31 If it is not possible to determine a rural rate because there are no tariffed or publicly available32 rates charged by other service providers for same or similar services in the rural area where the eligible health care provider is located, or if the service provider reasonably determines that the rural rate calculated using 25 Id. see also Connect America Fund, et al., WC Docket No. 10-90, et al., Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 26 FCC Rcd 17663, 17717 n.220 2011 noting that the same characteristics, such as lack of density, that make it expensive to provide voice service make it expensive to provide broadband service as well Federal Communications Commission, Connecting America The National Broadband Plan, at 136 2010 observing that because service providers in these areas cannot earn enough revenue to cover the costs of deploying and operating broadband networks, including expected returns on capital, there is no business case to offer broadband services in these areas. 26 See Nationwide Rates Database Waiver Order, para. 13 and Nationwide Rates Database Extension Order, para. 8. 27 But see infra Section III.B retaining rurality tiers for purposes of prioritization of funding in the event demand exceeds available funding. 28 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.605, as adopted herein see also 47 CFR  54.607 2019. 29 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.605b1, as adopted herein see also 47 CFR  54.607b1 2019. 30 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.605a, as adopted herein see also 47 CFR  54.607a 2019. 31 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.605b, as adopted herein see also 47 CFR  54.607b 2019. 32 Available rates include tariff rates and rates posted on service providers websites, rate cards, and publicly available contracts such as state master contracts, as well as undiscounted rates charged to E-Rate Program applicants, and prior funding year RHC Program pricing data. This list of possible sources of available rates is not intended to be exhaustive and other sources may be possible. The Wireline Competition Bureau Provides Guidance Regarding the Commissions Rules for Determining Rural Rates in the Rural Health Care Telecommunications Program, WC Docket No. 02-60, Public Notice, 34 FCC Rcd 533, 537 WCB 2019 Rural Rates Public Notice. 832 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 Method 2 is unfair, then health care providers and service providers may calculate a rural rate using Method 3.33 14. Reinstating these rules promotes administrative efficiency and protects the Fund while we consider long-term solutions. We clarify that a rural rate approval for a service will be required only in the first year of an evergreen contract or another form of a multi-year contract unless the rural rates in the contract increase or other substantive terms of the contract change.34 The rural rate approval for the initial year of the multi-year contract will constitute approval for all subsequent years of the contract, including voluntary extensions so long as the duration of the contract does not exceed five years. Given that service providers may not be expected to submit additional bids for the selected service within the duration of the multi-year contract, we believe that it is reasonable to eliminate rural rate approvals during that period as well. Therefore, previously approved rates for preexisting multi-year contracts do not need to be resubmitted for approval under the rate setting mechanisms we reinstate today. 15. We decline to adopt other options proposed by stakeholders or the Commission because they could lead to Program waste or pose implementation challenges. Alaska Communications and SHLBs suggestion to rely on competitive bidding alone to determine fair market rural rates could result in inflated rural rates.35 As the Commission previously explained in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, only a small percentage of Telecom Program funding requests receive competing bids from multiple service providers, and in the few instances where carriers do compete, they are most likely to compete on non-price characteristics of service.36 Therefore, we find that relying on competitive bidding without any other checks on rural rates would give service providers unfettered discretion to set their rates. Additionally, we find that the implementation challenges associated with the options raised in the Further Notice, such as a regression model37 or a discount tier mechanism prevent us at this time from adopting these mechanisms. 16. Rural rates waiver. We find that Bureaus temporary measure of permitting the use of previously-approved rural rates and urban rates for funding year 2023 is appropriate given that competitive bidding for funding year 2023 has already started.38 To further alleviate burdens on RHC Program participants as they prepare for funding years 2024 and 2025 we waive the Commissions rules 33 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.605b, as adopted herein see also 47 CFR  54.607b 2019. 34 See Letter from Richard Cameron, Counsel, Alaska Communications to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 17-310, 3 filed Jan. 19, 2023 Alaska Communications Ex Parte Letter from Gina Spade, Counsel, ENA Healthcare to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 17-310, 1 filed Jan. 18, 2023 ENA Ex Parte Letter from John Nakahata, Counsel, GCI Communication Corp. to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 17-310, 3 filed Jan. 17, 2023 GCI Jan. 17, 2023 Ex Parte Letter from Kristen Corra, Policy Counsel, Schools, Health  Libraries Broadband SHLB Coalition to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 17- 310, 2 filed Jan. 19, 2023 SHLB Jan. 19, 2023 Ex Parte. 35 Alaska Communications Petition at 6-7 Letter from Richard R.

Because rural healthcare providers do not pay the rural rate, they have little incentive to select a service provider based solely on its rural rate. See id. 37 See GCI Reply Comments at 12. 38 See Nationwide Rates Database Extension Order, para. 14 Alaska Rates Database Extension Order, para. 11. The Bureau also granted wavier to permit the use of rural and urban rates for funding years 2021 and 2022. See Nationwide Rates Database Waiver Order Nationwide Rates Database Waiver Order. 833 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 to permit the use of previously-approved rates for any funding year 2024 or 2025 rural rates that would otherwise require approval under Method 3.39 17. Generally, the Commissions rules may be waived or suspended for good cause shown.40 The Commission may exercise its discretion to waive a rule where the particular facts make strict compliance inconsistent with the public interest.41 In addition, the Commission may take into account considerations of hardship, equity, or more effective implementation of overall policy on an individual basis.42 Waiver of the Commissions rules is appropriate only if both 1 special circumstances warrant a deviation from the general rule, and 2 such deviation will serve the public interest.43 As noted by several commenters,44 potentially having three different sets of rules for determining cost-based rural rates within three or four funding years could present unnecessary administrative burdens. Continuing to permit the use of previously-approved rural rates for Method 3, the most complex rural rates verification process, would significantly curtail those burdens.45 Furthermore, according to commenters, market conditions appear to indicate that it is unlikely that pricing for Telecom Program funded services will significantly decrease over funding years 2024 or 2025, so utilizing rural rates approved for funding year 2023 in funding years 2024 and 2025 is unlikely to cause wasteful expenditures.46 18. A waiver permitting the use of previously-approved rates for funding years 2024 and 2025 Method 3 cost-based rural rates would also serve the public interest. Although there are significant program integrity benefits to rural rates reviews, we find that two years of such benefits is outweighed for funding years 2024 and 2025 by the administrative burdens on both program applicants and the Commission to prepare and approve cost studies. In addition, we find that it is not in the public interest to require service providers to absorb these burdens for funding years 2024 and 2025 given that the Commission is considering additional changes to its rural rate rules for future funding years in todays Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.47 19. In addition, we find that the public interest would not be served by extending this waiver to Method 1 and 2 rural rate or urban rate approvals because the administrative burden and time required for these justifications are considerably less than for Method 3 justifications.48 Therefore we find that for Method 1 and 2 and urban rate justifications, the program integrity benefits to requiring rate justifications outweigh any administrative burdens associated with complying with these rules for funding years 2024 39 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.605b, as adopted herein. Should the Commission adopt new rules for determining rural rates in advance of funding year 2024 or 2025, the Commission reserves the right to have those rules supersede this waiver. 40 47 CFR  1.3. 41 Northeast Cellular Telephone Co. v. FCC, 897 F.2d 1164, 1166 D.C. Cir. 1990 Northeast Cellular. 42 WAIT Radio v. FCC, 418 F.2d 1153, 1159 D.C.

See also SHLB Jan. 19, 2023 Ex Parte at 2 and Alaska Communications Ex Parte at 2 both requesting that the Commission permit the use of previously-approved rural rates for all methods indefinitely until new rules are implemented. 45 See GCI Jan. 19, 2023 Ex Parte at 2 explaining complexities of Method 3 approvals. 46 See Alaska Communications Ex Parte at 2 SHLB Jan. 19, 2023 Ex Parte at 4. 47 See infra section VI.B. 48 See GCI Jan. 19, 2023 Ex Parte at 2 describing administrative burdens unique to Method 3.

Furthermore, we find that a waiver under Methods 1 or 2 is not necessary because, when a service provider cannot find justifying rates under Methods 1 or 2, as some parties contend is common,49 the service provider has the option to rely on a previously approved Method 3 rate pursuant to the waiver we issue herein. 20. When this Method 3 waiver applies, a service provider may use a previously-approved rural rate from the most recent funding commitment for the facilityservice combination at issue provided that funding commitment was issued in funding years 2021, 2022, or 2023. If there is no approved rate for a particular facilityservice combination, the health care provider and its carrier may use a rural rate for the most recent funding commitment for the same or similar services to the facility with the same or similar geographic characteristics provided the funding commitment was issued in funding years 2021, 2022, or 2023. If no such comparable rates are available, this waiver is not applicable and the rural rate must be established using a Method 3 cost study pursuant to section 54.605b of our rules.50 21. For the reasons stated above, we find that restoring the previous rate methodology rules while we consider long-term solutions would best serve Program participants. Program participants are already familiar with the requirements of these methods, which will ease administrative burdens on the Commission, Administrator, and Program participants. 22. Although the rules that we reinstate today do not rely on a median approach to determine rural rates, as a general matter, we disagree with petitioners concerns with using a median-based approach to determine rural rates. The Rates Databases use of medians was a reasonable application of section 254h1A to prevent outlier prices from skewing support.51 Alaska Communications argued that, by basing support on a median rate rather than the actual rate charged, the Rates Database would not fulfill the requirements of section 254h1A of the Communications Act that telecommunications carriers receive the difference between the urban rate paid by the healthcare provider and the rate similar services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas.52 Similarly, USTelecom raised several concerns about the sufficiency of the median rate approach.53 Although we agree with petitioners that the Rates Database and geographic tiers established in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order did not accurately reflect the cost of delivering telecommunications services, we find that a median approach to calculate rural rates can satisfy the requirements of section 254h1A because a median can approximate the rates charged in comparable rural areas in the state.54 The fact that section 254h1A describes the services providers obligation to charge rates reasonably comparable to urban rates rather than a more restrictive standard such as the rate charged to an urban health care provider suggests the Commission could meet the requirements of section 254h1A as long as the level of support in the aggregate would make up the urban-rural differential. 23. Urban rates. We also grant petitions seeking rescission of the rules implementing the Rates Database to determine urban rates. Petitioners seeking reconsideration of the Promoting Telehealth 49 See SHLB Jan. 19, 2023 Ex Parte at 3 describing difficulties with obtaining justifying rates under Methods 1 and 2. We note that GCI, which serves rural health care providers throughout remote parts of Alaska and is the largest recipient of Telecom Program funding, projects that approximately 75 of its funding year 2024 TERRA and satellite funding requests will be submitted pursuant to Methods 1 or 2. GCI Jan. 19, 2023 Ex Parte at 2. 50 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.605b. 51 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7366, para. 63. 52 Alaska Communications Petition at 3 citing 47 U.S.C. 254h1A. See also Alaska Communications Petition at 4. 53 USTelecom Petition at 4-7. USTelecom also argued that the Rates Database could result in carriers being prohibited from charging tariffed rates in violation of state law. See id. Because we reconsider the Rates Database on other grounds, we need not reach this argument. 54 47 U.S.C.  254h1A. 835 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 Report and Order raised concerns about the Administrators ability to determine urban rates using the Rates Database.55 Furthermore, after the Rates Database launched, specific concerns about the urban rates it generated arose.56 In the Nationwide Rates Database Waiver Order, the Bureau acknowledged urban rate anomalies in the Rates Database in some states, including instances where urban rates for lower bandwidths exceeded urban rates for higher bandwidths for the same service, and examples of urban rates exceeding rural rates in a state.57 The Bureau concluded that these examples did not amount to convincing evidence of pervasive nationwide anomalies with urban rates but did merit further inquiry and investigation and therefore waived use of the Rates Database of determining urban rates.58 In comments in response to the Further Notice, SHLB reiterated that the Rates Database had significant urban rate anomalies, including instances in many states in which the median urban rate for a service exceeded at least one rural rate.59 ADS encouraged the Commission to reinstate a safe harbor approach for urban rates.60 24. We conclude that reinstating the previous urban rate determination rules is the best way to ensure consistency and predictability in the rate determination process while we consider alternative options for an urban rates determination mechanism going forward.61 None of the petitions for reconsideration suggested a mechanism for determining urban rates to be used if we were to eliminate the Rates Database, and none opposed returning to the pre-Promoting Telehealth Report and Order method for determining urban rates. As with rural rates, health care providers and service providers are already familiar with the pre-2019 rules for determining urban rates, and introducing a completely new set of rules while we consider additional changes could lead to confusion and cause an undue administrative burden. Therefore, going forward, the urban rate for an eligible service submitted by the healthcare provider on FCC Form 466 should be no higher than the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate charged to a commercial customer for a functionally similar service in any city with a population of 50,000 or more in a state.62 Healthcare providers must document the urban rate with tariff pages, contracts, a letter on company letterhead from the urban service provider, rate pricing information printed from the urban service providers website or similar documentation showing how the urban rate was obtained.63 We believe reinstatement of the prior urban rate setting methodology is the best available solution as we seek comment on potential revisions to the urban rate determination rules in the Second 55 See SHLB Comments at 20-21 USTelecom Comments at 14-15 Alaska Communications Comments 19-21. 56 See Letter from Gina Spade, Counsel, SHLB, to Marlene H.

This safe harbor refers to the Administrators practice under the pre-2019 rules of posting to its website examples of urban rates for certain services in various states that health care providers could use instead of obtaining urban rates through other means. 61 Until 2019, these rules had been codified in section 54.605. The current section 54.604, which governs determinations of urban rates using the Rates Database, will be amended to reflect the new rules. 62 See 47 CFR  54.604a, Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.605a 2019, as adopted herein. 63 See FCC Form 466 Instructions at 8 2019. 836 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking herein. As with rural rates, we also affirm the Bureaus decision to permit the use of previously-approved urban rates for funding year 2023.64 25. In adopting the Rates Database, the Commission identified several concerns with the rate-setting rules in place at the time, including potential issues with transparency, administrative efficiency, and program integrity.65 While the Rates Database proved to be an inadequate solution for provisioning sufficient support to RHC Program participants, we remain cognizant of those concerns, and we therefore continue our work to improve the Telecom Program rate determination methodology as discussed in the Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking herein. 2. Similar Services 26. Though RHC Program applicants and participating service providers will no longer use the Rates Database to calculate rural and urban rates, they will continue to need to identify rates for the same or similar services to support rural and urban rates submitted to the Administrator. We therefore address petitions for reconsideration of the Commissions conclusions regarding similar services in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.66 We find that the Commission properly determined that similar services can include non-telecommunications services that deliver the same or similar functionality as the requested service and can include services with advertised speeds 30 above or below the speed of the requested service. We instruct the Administrator to apply these requirements to its review of Method 1 and Method 2 submissions and urban rates going forward. 27. Non-telecommunications services. We affirm the Commissions finding that, to calculate the most accurate rates, the pool of rates taken into consideration should include rates for services that deliver the functionality sought by the applicant. We therefore deny USTelecoms request to reverse the decision that non-telecommunications services that are functionally similar to eligible telecommunications services be considered similar services for purposes of calculating rates.67 We reaffirm the Commissions conclusion in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order that similarity of services is a technology-agnostic inquiry that should be viewed from the perspective of the end user experience as opposed to regulatory classification.68 28. The Telecom Program provides support in accordance with section 254h1A of the Communications Act based on the difference between the urban rate, which must be reasonably comparable to the rates charged for similar services in urban areas in that State, and rates for similar services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas, i.e., the rural rate.69 Congress did not define the term similar services.70 In 2003, the Commission interpreted similar services to mean services that are functionally similar from the perspective of the end user.71 This interpretation deviated 64 See Nationwide Rates Database Extension Order, para. 14 and Alaska Rates Database Extension Order, para. 11. 65 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7363, para. 53. 66 See USTelecom Petition at 11-15 seeking reconsideration of the Commissions decision that non- telecommunications services can be similar to telecommunications services for purposes of rates determinations SHLB Petition at 16-17 seeking reconsideration of the Commissions decision that services with advertised speeds 30 above or below the speed of the requested service be considered functionally similar to the requested service. 67 USTelecom Petition at 11-15 Letter from B.

In the 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission sought comment on changes to the interpretation of similar services.74 The Commission specifically proposed to retain the concept of functionally similar as viewed from the perspective of the end user and additionally proposed to require healthcare providers to analyze similarity under specific criteria.75 In the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the Commission ultimately retained the functionally similar standard for defining similar services and, after acknowledging the prior interpretation in 2003, made clear that because the functionally similar standard is technology agnostic and does not turn on regulatory classification, both telecommunications and non-telecommunications services must be considered when identifying similar services for calculating urban and rural rates.76 30. USTelecom argues that the Commission did not provide an opportunity for notice and comment, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act APA, before expanding the inquiry of functionally similar services to include non-telecommunications services.77 On the contrary, the Commission did provide notice in the 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking of its intent to consider changes to the statutory interpretation of similar services.78 And as explained in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, revisiting this decision would inevitably involve a consideration of the types of services that would fall within the scope of this statutory term.79 We therefore disagree with USTelecom Continued from previous page Access Order discussing Interpretation of Similar Services. The Commission revised its rules on the determination of urban and rural rates consistent with this interpretation in 2003 to reference functionally similar services instead of similar services. Id. at 24586-89 revising rule sections 54.605 and 54.609. 72 Id. at 24563, para. 31. 73 Id. at 24563-64, para. 33-34 Promoting Telehealth in Rural America, WC Docket No. 17-310, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Order, 32 FCC Rcd 10631, 10655, para. 73 2017 To implement this functionally similar standard, the Commission established a voluntary safe harbor whereby a healthcare provider could claim that two services are similar if they both fall within one of five speed tiers. 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 74 See 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 32 FCC Rcd at 10655-56, paras. 73-78. 75 Id. at 10655, para. 75 emphasis in original. 76 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7341-46, paras. 15-20. 77 5 U.S.C.  553 USTelecom Petition at 11-14. 78 See 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 32 FCC Rcd at 10655, paras. 73-75  n.104 By functionally similar from the perspective of the end user, we mean these services offer features and functions that provide a similar user experience. id. at 10656, para. 77 We seek comment on other criteria we could use to establish similar services.. 79 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7343, para. 18, n.55. The Commission also specifically sought comment on using performance criteria associated with packet-based services that are often provided on a non-common carrier basis in the marketplace, e.g., as private carrier or information services. See 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 32 FCC Rcd at 10656, para. 77. This would provide an additional indication to the public that the Commission was considering a functionally similar standard that would not turn on the regulatory classification of the service. 838 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 that the Commission violated the APA when it clarified the scope of similar services to include not only telecommunications but also non-telecommunications services.80 31. The Commissions decision to expand the inquiry of functionally similar services in urban and rural rate determinations was not arbitrary and capricious, as USTelecom separately contends.81 We also disagree with USTelecom that the fact that the Telecom Program does not fund information and private carriage services precludes consideration of rates for those services in the rate determination process.82 As to both arguments, the Commission fully considered these issues in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order and explained that the end-user experience, not regulatory classification, guides our analysis of whether services are functionally equivalent.83 The Commission further explained that including information services, which may be less expensive, with functionally similar telecommunications services is consistent with the statutory requirement that the Commission ensure access to telecommunications services for health care providers at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged for similar services in urban areas because including rates for such functionally similar information services would more accurately reflect the prices available in urban areas for services that deliver the same functionality to end users regardless of classification, and place rural health care providers on equal footing with their urban counterparts.84 32. 30 percent threshold. We also deny SHLBs request that we reconsider the Commissions determination that services with advertised speeds 30 above or below the speed of the requested service be considered functionally similar to the requested service.85 SHLB argues that this approach is overbroad and will include services that are dissimilar in function and cost. SHLB, however, does not offer any examples.86 Comments filed after the Rates Database launched addressing the 30 threshold in response to the Further Notice were mixed. Alaska Communications described the 30 bandwidth range as not unreasonable, but cautioned that there is too little rural rate data in Alaska to make this the basis for a complete rural rate methodology.87 NTCA argues that the 30 threshold is too broad and urges the Commission to implement a smaller margin based on health care provider use cases, but also does not offer examples of overly broad results.88 80 Assuming, arguendo, that there was insufficient notice and comment, the Commissions defining of similar services and functionally similar services as referenced in the Commissions rules, to include telecommunications and non-telecommunications services that are functionally similar from the perspective of the end user could have been adopted as an interpretation not subject to the APAs notice-and-comment requirements. See 5 U.S.C.  553bA stating that the notice-and-comment requirement do not apply to interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice. Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Assn, 575 U.S. 92, 97 2015 The critical feature of interpretive rules is that they are issued by an agency to advise the public of the agencys construction of the statutes and rules which it administers.. The Commissions rules use the term functionally similar so the clarification made in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order could be viewed as a revised interpretation of the Commissions rules to include non-telecommunications services. 47 CFR  54.604a, 54.605a Perez, 575 U.S. at 100 holding that an interpretive rule can interpret not only a statute but also a prior agency rule. 81 USTelecom Petition at 14. 82 USTelecom Petition at 14 USTelecom Ex Parte at 2. 83 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7344-45, paras. 18-20. 84 Id. at 7345, para. 19 see also 47 U.S.C.  254h1A. 85 SHLB Petition at 16. 86 Id. 87 Alaska Communications Comments at 18. 88 NTCA Comments at 9. 839 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 33. Taking these arguments into account, we conclude that we should not deviate from the Commissions prior conclusion in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order that the 30 range allows for rate predictability while accounting for the rising demand for faster connectivity.89 Having a standard for determining similar services based on a range is preferable to having speed tiers, which would need to be frequently refreshed so they would not become out of date, as was the case with the speed tiers that existed before the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order. Moreover, based on the record previously developed, a range of 30 provides a sufficiently large number of inputs for determining rates under Methods 1 and 2.90 Reducing the range as NTCA requests would likely mean that few services with even slight variations in bandwidth would be similar to one another.91 Additionally, maintaining the current threshold for similar services of advertised speeds being 30 above or below the speed of the requested service will ease program administration because health care providers are already familiar with this standard. 34. We also disagree with SHLBs assertion that the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order fails to account for price variations based on contract term or volume discounts, which SHLB maintains will distort rural rate determinations.92 The Promoting Telehealth Report and Order did account for these price variations when explaining that section 254h1A requires service providers to provide telecommunications services to eligible providers at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.93 35. Finally, as requested by GCI, we clarify that, in the event there is no comparable rural rate within 30 of the speed of the requested service, the Commission will allow service providers to justify the requested rural rate using the rate for a service that is otherwise similar to the requested service if the requested service has a higher bandwidth than that service.94 Similarly, as requested by SHLB,95 we clarify that if there is no comparable urban rate within the 30 range available, the Commission will allow service providers to use the rate for a higher bandwidth service that falls outside the 30 range but is otherwise similar to the requested service.96 We find that providing this flexibility will ease administrative burdens without additional cost to the Universal Service Fund. 3. Site and Service Substitution 36. We deny Alaska Communications petition for reconsideration to the extent it seeks clarification that the Commission intended to include service delivery dates in the adopted site and 89 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7343-44, para. 16. SHLB also asserts that determining rates on a per-Mbps basis could be used within the 30 advertising speed range. SHLB Petition at 16. The Commission rejected the per-Mbps approach in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order as contrary to the purpose of the similar services inquiry, which is to identify services that are functionally similar to the end user and not to identify services that are similarly priced. Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7366, n.179. 90 See id. at 7343-44, para. 16. 91 See NTCA Comments at 9. 92 SHLB Petition at 16-17. 93 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7344, n.49 emphasis added. SHLB is mistaken in claiming that section 254h1A only describes the urban rate and not the determination of permissible rural rates. See SHLB Petition at 17. The very purpose of section 254h1A is to establish the means of determining rural rates by comparison to urban rates i.e., rural rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas in the State.. 47 U.S.C.  254h1A. 94 See GCI Jan. 17, 2023 Ex Parte at 3. 95 See SHLB Jan. 19, 2023 Ex Parte at 4. 96 The Commission allowed this flexibility in previous waiver orders. See, e.g., Nationwide Rates Database Waiver Order, para. 18. 840 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 service substitution rule.97 Alaska Communications explains that service date or evergreen contract date changes are some of the most common changes requested in the RHC Program.98 Alaska Communications further explains that applicants are required to submit a funding request and include anticipated service dates at the time the request is submitted to the Administrator, but there may be delays for a planned transition or deployment of upgraded services and the anticipated service start or termination dates may change.99 In response, we clarify that under section 54.624a of our rules, RHC Program applicants may be able to substitute the requested service when there is a delay in the deployment of the original service and that the funding request could be modified to reflect the substituted service when such a delay may occur.100 Section 54.624a is intended to allow applicants flexibility to substitute requested services and to receive RHC Program support for substituted services when the requirements are met.101 37. However, we deny Alaska Communications request to clarify that section 54.624a allows changes to service dates and evergreen contract dates as service substitution changes because section 54.624a does not address service dates or evergreen contract dates.102 With respect to service date changes, Program participants are already permitted to change the dates for which services are provided. RHC Program participants are required to provide dates of service and contract dates on the Request for Funding FCC Form 466 or FCC Form 462 for the requested services.103 If there are changes to the dates for which services were provided or evergreen contract dates, RHC Program participants already modify service dates through other means unrelated to the service substitution process.104 Therefore, there is already a mechanism for all RHC Program participants to substitute a service if there is 97 Alaska Communications Petition at 21.

In addition, support is restricted to qualifying site and service substitutions that do not increase the total amount of support under the applicable funding commitment.

Participants may also request a service delivery date extension prior to the end of the same funding year by contacting the Administrator. 841 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 a delay in implementing the new service and modify the service dates for the substituted service. Contrary to Alaska Communications assertion that this process creates additional administrative burdens due to the potential for an appeal, this process is no more administratively burdensome than the service substitution request process. Under both processes, if the Administrator denies a request, the health care provider could file an appeal.105 With respect to evergreen contract dates, although section 54.624 cannot reasonably be interpreted as addressing modifications to evergreen contract dates, we seek comment in the Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking below about whether a mechanism to modify evergreen contract dates is appropriate and what such a mechanism might be.106 Accordingly, we deny the request to modify section 54.624 to add modification of service dates and evergreen contract dates as an allowable service substitution. 38. Alaska Communications further requests that when the Administrator contacts a health care provider with questions or requests for additional information regarding urban or rural rates or the terms of the service, the Administrator also be required to communicate the question or information request with the relevant service provider.107 Health care providers are encouraged to work with their service providers to respond to information requests from the Administrator regarding, for example, additional information on urban and rural rates and terms of service.108 Thus, service providers are allowed to provide the requested information needed during the funding application review process.109 We decline, however, to require the Administrator to issue information requests to the relevant service providers. We conclude that it would be administratively burdensome and a poor use of limited administrative resources to require the Administrator to send these requests to service providers. Applicants that would like assistance from service providers should reach out to providers to pose questions related to the Administrators review of health care providers funding applications.110 4. Remaining Requests for Reconsideration of the Rates Database 39. We dismiss as moot all other challenges to the Rates Database raised in the petitions for reconsideration that are not applicable to rural rate determinations under Method 1, Method 2, or Method 3 or urban rate determinations.111 Our decision above to eliminate the use of the Rates Database to calculate urban and rural rates renders these challenges moot.112 105 See 47 CFR  54.719. 106 See infra.

Rurality 40. We next deny requests to reconsider aspects of the geographically-based rurality tiers adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.113 Though the termination of the Rates Database moots the use of rurality tiers for purposes of rates determination, rurality tiers are also used to prioritize support in the event that demand exceeds available support, a mechanism that is unchanged by todays actions.114 41. In the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the Commission established three tiers of rurality to determine comparable rural areas in a state or territory for purposes of the Rates Database 1 Extremely Rural areas entirely outside of a Core Based Statistical Area 2 Rural areas within a Core Based Statistical Area that does not have an Urban Area with a population of 25,000 or greater and 3 Less Rural areas in a Core Based Statistical Area that contains an Urban Area with a population of 25,000 or greater, but are within a specific census tract that itself does not contain any part of a Place or Urban Area with a population of greater than 25,000.115 For health care providers in Alaska, the Commission bifurcated the Extremely Rural tier to include a Frontier tier for areas not accessible by road.116 42. Arguments against the rurality tiers adopted by the Commission in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order focused on their impact on rates determinations in the Rates Database.117 With the elimination of the Rates Database, the only remaining relevance of rurality tiers is for purposes of prioritizing support in the event that demand ever exceeds available funding.118 We find that the rurality tiers as adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order are appropriate for purposes of prioritization of support and deny petitions for reconsideration to the extent they request that the Commission eliminate rurality tiers from its rules for all purposes. The rurality tiers will properly target RHC Program funding to less populous areas in the event that prioritization of funds is needed, and the Continued from previous page 112 Additionally, we dismiss the petition for reconsideration filed by USTelecom to the extent it seeks modification of the FCC Form 465 or clarification of its instructions. See USTelecom Petition at 23-25. These requests are outside the scope of the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order. See 47 CFR  1.429l5 allowing dismissal of petitions for reconsideration that relate to matters outside the scope of the order for which reconsideration is sought. Furthermore, the FCC Forms 461 and 465 already capture the range of bandwidths the health care provider seeks bids for. See Request for Services Form, FCC Form 461, OMB Control No. 3060-0604 Description of Services Requested and Certification Form, FCC Form 465, OMB Control No. 3060-0604. 113 See State of Alaska Petition at 4-7 NCTNASOHCN Petition at 10-13 SHLB Petition at 12-15. 114 See 47 CFR  54.621b. 115 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7346-47, para. 21. 116 Id. at 7352, para. 34. The Commission defined Frontier areas as those that are outside of a Core Based Statistical Area that are inaccessible by road. To determine which communities are connected by roads, the Commission stated that it would use data provided by the Alaska Department of Commerce Community and Economic Development, Division of Community and Regional Affairs. Id. at 7352-53, para. 35. 117 See SHLB Petition at 13-14 contending that the tiers are overly broad because they group together areas of states with differing topography and infrastructure and are therefore not tied to the actual cost of service State of Alaska Petition at 4-6 arguing that Alaska should be differentiated geographically based on fiber availability NCTNASOHCN Petition at 10-13 requesting that the Commission use United States Census Bureau designation that divides Core-Based Statistical Areas into Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, arguing that relying on Census-recognized designations would allow applicants and the Administrator to pre-qualify sites and determine funding priority for each site. 118 See 47 CFR  54.621b setting tiers for prioritization based on rurality tiers and designation as a Medically Underserved Area or Population. 843 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 record contains no alternative mechanism for better parsing rurality for this limited purpose.119 43. NCTNASOHCN suggests that switching to a method based on metropolitan and micropolitan designations would allow the Administrator to pre-qualify sites and to demonstrate rurality and to determine the funding priority each site will receive and that switching from designations based on census blocks instead of census tracts would be more precise. However, the Administrator has already created a tool that allows health care providers to determine their priority tier based on the current rurality designations, so a change is not necessary to provide this administrative convenience.120 While we recognize the benefit of precision in parsing rurality, we find that the potential confusion and administrative burdens to all Program participants that would result from abandoning the use of the current rurality tiers, which are consistent with the Commissions long-held definition of rural, outweighs the impact this change would have on the limited number of health care providers whose rural status would change.121 44. Given our decision on reconsideration to eliminate the rules establishing the Rates Database, we make two ministerial changes to our rules to reflect the limited use of rurality tiers for prioritization purposes.122 First, we eliminate the concept of Frontier Areas from our rules because it does not apply to prioritizing support. A Frontier Area is an area in Alaska outside of a Core Based Statistical Area that is inaccessible by road. The Commission adopted this concept for purposes of the Rates Database only.123 Second, we amend our codified rules so that rurality tiers are addressed only in rules related to prioritization. The rurality tiers currently appear in two separate sections of our rules section 54.605a, which addresses rural rates, and section 54.621b, which addresses prioritization of support. We delete references to the rurality tiers from section 54.605a but retain them in section 54.621b. We also make minor changes to the text of section 54.621b so that it more closely reflects the text of section 54.605a.124 C. Funding Prioritization 1. Internal Cap on Multi-Year Commitments and Upfront Payments 45. We deny NCTNASOHCNs petition for reconsideration requesting an increase to the internal cap on funding available to HCF applicants seeking support for upfront payments and multi-year commitments.125 This internal cap limits funding for multi-year commitments and upfront payment to an 119 Because there has been sufficient funding to satisfy demand since the prioritization rules adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the prioritization system has never been used. 120 See USAC website, Rurality Tier Search Tool, httpswww.usac.orgrural-health-careresourcestoolsrurality- tier-search-tool last visited Jan. 26, 2023. 121 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7350, para. 32. 122 We find additional notice and comment for these changes is not needed because it would be unnecessary given that they are ministerial reflections of other changes to the rules. See 5 U.S.C.  553bB see also 47 CFR  1.412c. 123 Compare 47 CFR 54.605a1iv to 47 CFR 54.621b. For purposes of prioritization, Frontier Areas were treated as part of the Extremely Rural Tier. 124 Section 54.605a defined the Extremely Rural Tier as areas entirely outside of a Core Based Statistical Area whereas section 54.621a defined it as counties entirely outside of Core Based Statistical Area. We apply the nomenclature that appeared in section 54.605a to section 54.621a. 125 NCTNASOHCN Petition at 7. NCTNASOHCN also urge the Commission to revisit the overall annual cap under the RHC Program. See id. at 3-6 see also 47 CFR  54.619a setting the funding cap at 571 million per funding year and adjusting that figure annually for inflation beginning in funding year 2018. We decline to do so here as the time for reconsideration of our decision to increase the cap on overall funding, which was adopted in 2018, has passed. See Promoting Telehealth in Rural America, WC Docket No. 17-310, Report and Order, 33 FCC Rcd 6574 2018 RHC Program Cap Order. 844 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 amount adjusted annually for inflation, which is calculated at 161 million for funding year 2022.126 The Commission retained the internal cap in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order after determining that the cap protected against possible underfunding of single-year funding requests and that an increase in the dollar amount of the internal cap may adversely affect single-year requests.127 The Commission did, however, adopt a rule adjusting the cap annually for inflation as a hedge against loss of purchasing power in the event of price inflation.128 NCTNASOHCN maintain that the decision to not further increase the internal cap is based on an incorrect reading of the purpose of the cap  namely, that the principal purpose of establishing the cap was to guard against fluctuations in demands from potentially large upfront infrastructure projects.129 NCTNASOHCN also argue that the Commission should reconsider the cap in light of its original purpose and data accumulated since 2013 when it was first implemented130 and therefore should remove multi-year funding commitments from being subject to the cap.131 46. We deny NCTNASOHCNs request.132 The internal cap on multi-year commitments and upfront payments in its current form is serving its stated purpose to limit major fluctuations in demand so as to protect single-year funding requests. In the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the Commission noted that the internal cap was first exceeded in funding year 2018 and, but for the cap, all funding requests for that year would have been prorated to bring the total demand for RHC Program support below the Programs overall funding cap.133 We also find that the record does not support removing multi-year commitments from the internal cap. NCTNASOHCN point to efficiencies that are inherent to some multi-year funding commitments.134 However, USAC data indicates that demand for multi-year commitments accounted for a significant portion of the total demand for multi-year 126 See 47 CFR  54.619a establishing an internal cap of 150 million for funding requests for upfront payment and multi-year commitments 47 CFR  54.619a2 requiring the internal cap to be adjusted annually for inflation. See also Wireline Competitive Bureau Announces E-Rate and RHC Programs Inflation-Based Caps for Funding Year 2022, CC Docket No. 02-6, WC Docket No. 02-60, Public Notice, DA 22-271 WCB Mar. 14, 2022 announcing an internal cap of 161 million for funding year 2022. 127 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7401, para. 138. 128 See id. at para. 139. To measure increases in the rate of inflation for purposes of adjusting the internal cap on multi-year commitments and upfront payments, the Commission uses the Gross Domestic Product Chain-type Price Index GDP-CPI. See 47 CFR  54.619a2. 129 NCTNASOHCN Petition at 7. 130 Id. at 9. 131 Id. at 8. 132 While we deny NCTNASOHCNs request to increase the internal cap, the internal cap application rule we adopt today in the Report and Order below reduces the chance that the internal cap will create a cut in funding for multi- year commitment and upfront payment requests, because as long as the total available funding is greater than the total demand, the internal cap will not apply. See infra Part IV.B Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.619a, as adopted herein. 133 Since then, program demand for multi-year commitments and upfront payments has exceeded the internal cap in funding year 2019 and 2020, though full funding of single-year requests was not inhibited. See Rural Health Care Support Mechanism, WC Docket No. 02-60, Order, 35 FCC Rcd 2659, 2662, para. 8 2020 Funding Year 2019 Demand Order funding year 2019 funding cap on upfront payment and multi-year commitments exceeded by approximately 60 million Rural Health Care Support Mechanism, WC Docket No. 02-60, Order, 35 FCC Rcd 11696, 11698-99, paras. 7, 11 WCB 2020 Funding Year 2020 Demand Order funding year 2020 funding cap on upfront payments and multi-year commitments exceeded by approximately 43 million Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7400, para. 138. 134 See NCTNASOHCN Petition at 8. 845 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 commitments and upfront payments from funding year 2016 to funding year 2021.135 As demonstrated by demand in recent funding years, removing multi-year commitments from being subject to the internal cap could result in costly multi-year commitment requests usurping funding from single-year requests. We affirm the Commissions earlier decision to retain the internal cap on multi-year commitments and upfront payments and, accordingly, deny that portion of the NCTNASOHCN petition.136 In the Report and Order below, we amend our rules so that the internal cap applies only when demand exceeds available funding, and when the internal cap does apply, upfront costs and the first year of a multi-year commitment request are prioritized over the second and third year of a multi-year commitment request.137 2. Prioritization System 47. We next deny SHLBs request that we reconsider the prioritization system adopted by the Commission in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.138 RHC Program prioritization rules require that, in funding years when demand exceeds the funding cap, funding be prioritized based on rurality tiers and whether the area is a Medically Underserved AreaPopulation.139 SHLB first argues that the prioritization rules will result in HCF consortia, which include non-rural health care providers that are prioritized last when demand exceeds available funding, bearing the entire burden of RHC Program funding shortfalls initially.140 SHLB further argues that this impact will erode the consortia model and reduce the benefits of consortia for rural health care providers.141 We disagree and find the Commission reasonably concluded that, to further the goals of section 254h of the Act, it should prioritize funding based on the rurality of the health care providers location, as well as on the level of medical care need in that location.142 This prioritization scheme targets support to rural areas that are less likely to have access to telecommunications and advanced services while still providing support for health care consortia that 135 Letter from Mark Sweeney, Vice President, Rural Health Care Division, USAC, to Jodie Griffin, Chief, Telecommunication Access Policy Division, FCC Wireline Competition Bureau, and Bryan Boyle, Deputy Chief, Telecommunication Access Policy Division, FCC Wireline Competition Bureau, WC Docket 17-310, Table 5 filed Apr. 1, 2022. 136 NCTNASOHN also request that the Commission consider a carry-forward process by which unused funding from upfront payments and multi-year commitments be carried forward specifically for commitments above the internal cap in a given funding year. NCTNASOHN Petition at 10. We decline to adopt an HCF-specific carry- forward process because of the funding flexibility already afforded to us with the RHC Program-wide carry-forward provision, which is designed to fund future year requests in accordance with the public interest. See 47 CFR  54.619a4 see also Funding Year 2019 Demand Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 2663-64, para. 12 carrying forward unused funds to cover funding year 2019 demand. 137 See infra Part IV.B. 138 SHLB Petition at 2-3. 139 47 CFR  54.621b Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7390, para. 116. 140 SHLB Petition at 2-3 The Order adopts a new system for prioritizing limited RHC funding that, in effect, imposes 100 percent of the burden of any RHC funding shortfalls initially on HCF consortia.. 141 Id. at 3. 142 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7389, para. 115. Congress intended for section 254h to assist health care providers in rural areas with affordable access to modern communications services to enable them to provide medical services to all parts of the nation. See 47 U.S.C.  254h H.R. Rep. No. 104-458, at 131 1996 Conf. Rep. explaining that Congress intended section 254h to ensure that health care providers for rural areas . . . have affordable access to modern telecommunications services that will enable them to provide medical . . . services to all parts of the Nation and that the ability of . . . rural health care providers to obtain access to advanced telecommunications services is critical to ensuring that these services are available on a universal basis. see also Universal Service First Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd at 8795, para. 31 stating the level of discounts correlated to indicators of poverty and high cost i.e., rurality for schools and libraries . . . satisfies section 254h1Bs directive that the discount be an amount that is appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable access to and use of the services eligible for the discount.. 846 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 include non-rural health care providers.143 Thus, while SHLB is correct in noting the benefits that rural health care providers receive as members of consortia,144 we are not persuaded that these consortia warrant higher funding priority over the most rural and medically underserved health care providers. When the Commission adopted the rules permitting HCF consortia, it limited program participation in a fiscally responsible manner so as not to jeopardize funding for rural healthcare providers.145 The prioritization system adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order aligns with this fiscally responsible approach and we decline to reconsider it here.146 3. Medically Underserved Areas and Populations 48. We decline to revise our use of the Medically Underserved Areas and Populations MUAP designation to determine funding prioritization based on medical need. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration HRSA designates an area as MUAP when the area lacks sufficient primary care services.147 SHLB requests that we revise HRSAs data by clarifying that all areas in counties with a population density below twenty persons per square mile will be considered to be MUAP, arguing that many such sparsely populated areas have never sought MUAP designation but are nonetheless underserved.148 We decline to adopt SHLBs requested modification. As the Commission explained in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the MUAP designation is well-suited for determining prioritization in the Telecom Program because it is objective data from another Federal agency that shows the areas that currently lack health care services and therefore would most benefit from the availability of telehealth services.149 In addition, relying on HRSAs determination is straight-forward and easy to administer.150 SHLB did not provide any data that would enable the Commission to verify its claim that many sparsely populated areas have declined to seek a MUAP designation from HRSA.151 Furthermore, we decline to add administrative complexity to this paradigm by adding population density into the determination. D. Certifications 49. We deny USTelecoms request that we reconsider the requirement adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order that service providers certify on invoices submitted to the Administrator that consultants or third parties hired by a service provider do not have an ownership interest, sales commission arrangement, or other financial stake in the service provider or, in the 143 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7389, para. 115. Prioritizing limited funding to health care providers in more rural areas fulfills the Commissions statutory mandate to preserve and advance universal service.. 144 See SHLB Petition at 8. 145 See Healthcare Connect Fund Order, 27 FCC Rcd at 16707, para. 61. 146 SHLB also argues that the Commission ignored serious practical challenges USAC the Administrator will likely face implementing the new prioritization regime as it applies to consortia. SHLB Petition at 6. We disagree and note that the Administrator has created IT systems to implement the Commissions prioritization rules. While we decline to reconsider the prioritization system, the amendment to our rules we adopt today in the Report and Order to have the internal cap apply only when overall demand exceeds available funding alleviates the impact on non-rural health care providers when funding requests for upfront payments and multi-year commitments must be prioritized. See infra Part IV.B Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.621b, as adopted herein. 147 See HRSA website, Health Workforce Shortage Areas, httpsdata.hrsa.govtopicshealth-workforceshortage- areas?tabmuapHeader last visited Jan. 26, 2023. HRSA uses the Index of Medical Underservice and recommendations from state governors to make this designation. See id. 148 SHLB Petition at 24-25. 149 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7390, para. 116. 150 See id. at 7394, paras. 122-123. 151 SHLB Petition at 25  nn. 68-70. 847 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 alternative, that we clarify that this certification applies only on a forward-looking basis.152 In response to this request, the Bureau clarified that the prohibition on third party commission arrangements does not apply to competitive bidding processes completed before funding year 2020.153 50. We decline, however, to eliminate this certification and now address the arguments that USTelecom raised in its petition for reconsideration. We disagree with USTelecoms argument that the Commission did not provide adequate notice for this new requirement.154 The Commission sought comment in the 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on whether to require healthcare providers and service providers to certify that the consultants and outside experts they hire do not have an ownership interest, sales commission arrangement, or other financial stake in the vendor chosen to provide the requested service.155 USTelecoms argument ignores that the certification language adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order stems directly from the language used in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 51. Second, while USTelecom acknowledges that the use of consultants that have financial relationships with vendors raises conflict of interest concerns for RHC Program applicants, we disagree with USTelecom that there are no such concerns for commissioned consultants working for service providers.156 Similar concerns are applicable to service providers who have commissioned sales agreements with other third parties based on contracts awarded through the Program. For example, there have been previous instances where a service providers sales agent apparently shared other carriers confidential pricing information to provide an unfair competitive advantage to that service provider when it responded to a health care providers request for services.157 In addition, commissioned consultants or sales agents who simultaneously represent multiple service providers could direct business toward the service provider that pays the highest commission or has the highest bid to maximize their earnings.158 Such conflicts of interest and anti-competitive conduct violate the Programs longstanding fair and open competitive bidding requirement, which the Commission codified in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.159 We therefore clarify that agents compensated solely by commission, and not just those that 152 USTelecom Petition at 15-16, 18 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7414, para. 170 47 CFR  54.627I3iiI, 54.627d1iiG. 153 See Wireline Competition Bureau Clarifies Rural Health Care Program Certification Requirement, WC Docket No. 17-310, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 5394 WCB 2020. 154 USTelecom Petition at 15-16. 155 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 32 FCC Rcd at 10659, para. 88. 156 USTelecom Petition at 16. 157 See, e.g., Network Services Solutions, LLC, File No. EB-IHD-15-0001913, Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Order, 31 FCC Rcd 12238, 12255-56, para. 52 2016 detailing an example of a service providers sales agent sharing another telecommunications carriers confidential pricing with Network Services Solutions LLC NSS to provide NSS with an unfair competitive advantage in responding to the health care providers request for services. 158 See, e.g., Requests for Review of Decisions of the Universal Service Administrator by Windstream Communications LLC, WC Docket No. 02-60, Order, 35 FCC Rcd 10312, 10315-16, para. 7 WCB 2020 explaining that Windstreams non-exclusive sales agent was entitled to receive 20 of the monthly recurring revenue from the RHC Program contracts awarded to Windstream. 159 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7410, para. 161.

We disagree. While USTelecom is generally correct that the Commission has sought to harmonize requirements between RHC and E-Rate, the greater likelihood of RHC consultant misconduct justifies a different requirement in the RHC Program at this time.161 As such, we affirm the certification rule and deny USTelecoms request to strike this requirement, which applies to competitive bidding practices from funding year 2020 forward. 52. Additionally, we deny USTelecoms request to clarify that a service provider certification addressing eligible services does not include an attestation that the services for which the disbursement is sought are eligible for Program support.162 In the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the Commission adopted a requirement that service providers certify they have charged the health care provider for only eligible services prior to submitting the invoice form and accompanying documentation.163 USTelecom argues that this certification should be interpreted not to apply to the eligibility of the services, arguing that service providers are not responsible for determining the eligibility of services, and that requiring service providers to make such a certification will preclude them from including both eligible services and services not supported by the Program on the same bill submitted to the applicant.164 On the contrary, the new certification, one of several added to invoicing forms to improve the invoicing process and ensure compliance with Commission rules,165 does not create a new burden because service providers are already required to abide by Program service eligibility rules.166 While service providers may include ineligible services and eligible services on the invoices they submit to health care providers, it is critical that service providers engage in due diligence to ensure that they seek reimbursement from the Administrator for eligible services only. Service providers are in the best position to evaluate whether the services they provide are eligible for RHC Program support because they understand the technical details of the services they provide. We therefore confirm that service providers are certifying to the eligibility of the services provided when they certify that they charged the health care provider for only eligible services prior to submitting the invoice form and accompanying 160 See USTelecom Petition at 17, n.4 suggesting that the prohibition may not apply to agents working solely on commission. 161 Rural health care consultants sometimes provide bids from multiple service providers for a single health care provider, which raises concerns that the consultant could withhold lower-priced bids from the health care provider to maximize the sales commission. See Petition for Expedited Declaratory Ruling Regarding the Application of 47 C.F.R.  54.627 and 47 C.F.R.  54.622 of The Rural Health Care Program or in the Alternative a Waiver, WC Docket 17-310 filed Feb. 9, 2021. We further note that financial relationships between service providers and a consultant that is retained by the applicant violate the E-Rate programs competitive bidding rules and are not allowed given the control a consultant may have over the applicants competitive bid process. See Requests for Waiver and Review of Decisions of the Universal Service Administrator by Akisha Networks, Inc., et al., Order, 27 FCC Rcd 8294, 8295-96, para. 2 WCB 2012 A consultant, acting on behalf of the applicant, exerts great influence on an applicants bidding process and thus, should not have a financial relationship with a service provider which it selects or recommends on behalf of the applicant.. 162 Id. at 21-22. 163 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7424-25, paras. 192-93 47 CFR  54.627c3iiG, 54.627d1iiE. 164 USTelecom Petition at 21-22. 165 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7424-25, paras. 192-93. 166 See, e.g., 47 CFR  54.603b providing that only telecommunications services are eligible for support through the Telecom Program 47 CFR  54.606a providing that universal support under the Telecom Program will be provided for only eligible telecommunications services at the difference between the urban rate and the rural rate charged for the service emphasis added. 849 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 documentation.167 We clarify that with respect to billing, service providers may include both eligible and ineligible services on a single bill to the health care provider but RHC Program reimbursement may only be sought for eligible services.168 53. Finally, we make one minor change to the Telecom Program certifications and issue an additional clarification as sought by USTelecom. First, in order to eliminate the potential for confusion, we grant USTelecoms request169 to update Telecom Program certifications to add the word form after invoice to bring the certification in line with the HCF Program certifications.170 Second, we clarify, as USTelecom requests, that a service provider need not ensure that a health care provider is current on its payments before certifying that the health care provider has paid the appropriate urban rate. 171 Having outstanding balances on payments owed to a service provider does not necessarily mean that the health care provider did not pay the appropriate urban rate. IV. SECOND REPORT AND ORDER 54. In this Second Report and Order, we amend the Telecom Program invoicing process to harmonize the RHC invoicing process across the Telecom Program and the HCF Program. We also amend our funding cap and prioritization rules to limit the application of the internal cap and prioritize health care providers current year financial need over their future year need when the internal cap is exceeded. Additionally, we make minor changes to the text of the RHC Program rules regarding the number of health care provider types that are eligible in the RHC Program. These actions will promote efficiency, reduce delays in funding commitments, and minimize the possibility that some health care providers may not receive their current years support in the event of prioritization to upfront payment and multi-year commitment requests, while strengthening protections against waste, fraud, and abuse. A. Invoicing 55. To closer harmonize the invoicing process across the Telecom Program and the HCF Program, we eliminate the use of Health Care Provider Support Schedules HSSs in the Telecom Program and require the participating service provider and health care provider to submit an invoice for service to the Administrator after services are provided consistent with the HCF Program effective for funding year 2024.172 In the Further Notice, we proposed to fully harmonize the invoicing process between the Telecom Program and the HCF Program by having participants in both programs invoice the Administrator for services actually provided using the FCC Form 463 Invoice and Request for Disbursement Form.173 Additionally, we proposed to retire the FCC Form 467 Connection Certification, which is currently used for invoicing in the Telecom Program.174 167 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7425, para. 193. 47 CFR  54.627c3iiG, 54.627d1iiE. 168 Service providers submit the FCC Form 463 for the HCF Program or the Telecommunications Program invoice form Telecom Program to the Administrator to request reimbursement through the RHC Program. The service providers customer bill to the health care provider is not submitted to the Administrator for reimbursement. Thus, the customer bill may include both eligible and ineligible services, but the invoice form i.e., the FCC Form 463 or the Telecom Program invoice form submitted to the Administrator must seek reimbursement for only eligible services andor equipment. Any ineligible items on the customer bill may not be included in the invoice form submitted to the Administrator. 169 USTelecom Petition at 22. 170 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.627c1iD, as adopted herein. 171 USTelecom Petition at 23. 172 See Further Notice at paras. 72-76 proposing to eliminate HHSs in the Telecom Program and harmonizing the invoicing process across both Rural Healthcare Program programs. 173 See id. at para. 76. 850 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 56. We adopt our proposal to eliminate HSSs in the Telecom Program and retire the FCC Form 467.175 Eliminating the use of HSSs in the Telecom Program will stop payments being disbursed automatically with minimal action from the health care provider or service provider.176 Because the FCC Form 467 is the form filed before a health care provider can receive an HSS, it will no longer be necessary and will be eliminated.177 However, rather than adopt the FCC Form 463 for the Telecom Program as proposed, we instead direct the Administrator, upon approval from the Bureau, to adopt a new invoice form for the Telecom Program that will be filed after services have been provided, and will allow participants to indicate when services have started, and will more clearly identify what services RHC Program applicants receive during the funding year while maintaining separation between the HCF Program and Telecom Program invoicing processes. 57. Creating a new Telecom Program invoicing form, which is distinct from, but functionally similar to, the FCC Form 463 will ensure that invoicing in the Telecom Program occurs after services have actually started, that service providers are reimbursed for actual costs rather than predetermined amounts established by the HSS, and that participants need not take action to change an HSS if the services are terminated or never begin. Having distinct forms for each program will account for the fact that there are consortium applications in the HCF Program but not in the Telecom Program. Additionally, we find that adopting this process for invoicing in the Telecom Program will further alleviate inefficiencies and protect against waste, fraud, and abuse in the RHC Program. This new process for invoicing will eliminate the need for health care providers to file, and subsequently amend, an FCC Form 467. It will also reduce the likelihood of improper disbursements because disbursements will be based on charges for services that were actually provided rather than expected charges for services anticipated to be provided.178 58. Service providers will initiate the invoicing process by preparing the new Telecom invoicing form and service providers and health care providers will continue to make the same certifications on the new form that they have previously made on Telecom invoicing forms.179 As with HCF Program invoices, invoices in the Telecom Program can be submitted any time after services have been provided and the service provider sends an invoice to the health care provider. A service provider can submit an invoice form to the Administrator after each month of service or, if it elects to, may alternatively wait until the end of the funding year to submit a single invoice for all services provided during the funding year. All invoices for services actually incurred must be submitted before the invoice filing deadline, consistent with Commission rules.180 59. Some commenters raised concerns that adopting a system in which disbursements are Continued from previous page 174 See id. at para. 76. 175 See id. at paras. 75-76. See also Windstream Comment at 8-9 supporting the elimination of the HSS CHC Comments at 2 supporting the streamlining of the Telecom Program invoice process and discussing the elimination of the FCC Form 467. Some commenters opposed this proposal, claiming that harmonizing the two programs invoicing processes would increase administrative burdens and possibly disrupt funding disbursements. See ENA Comments at 8-9, GCI Comments at 18, SLHB Comments at 21. See also ADS Reply Comments at 3. For the reasons discussed herein, we find that preventing improper payments outweighs added administrative burdens. 176 See id. at para. 74 describing the invoicing process in the Telecom Program, which relies on a predetermined schedule rather than invoicing against actual costs incurred. 177 See id. at para. 76 If the proposal to eliminate HSSs is adopted, the use of the FCC Form 467 would be unnecessary because health care providers would no longer need to file the form to receive HSSs.. 178 This invoicing process allows service providers to bill for actual charges even if the actual charges are lower than the anticipated charges that the funding commitment is based on. 179 See 47 CFR  54.627c3. 180 See 47 CFR  54.627b. 851 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 made based on invoices filed after services are provided, rather than a predetermined HSS for the Telecom Program, would increase administrative burdens, and these burdens could be exacerbated by the fact that invoices in the Telecom Program can be submitted only on an individual basis, rather than on a consortium basis.181 Other commenters supported harmonizing the invoicing processes so long as there are mechanisms to reduce increased administrative burdens.182 We recognize that adopting an invoicing system based upon actual expenses incurred will likely require more invoice-related filings from program participants, but the history of improper disbursements from the use of the HSS justifies any potential added burden.183 To mitigate any administrative burdens,184 we direct the Bureau to work with the Administrator to develop a mechanism for filing this new form and to provide service providers the functionality to file invoices for multiple funding requests for multiple health care providers in a single filing. B. Internal Cap Application And Prioritization 60. We adopt the changes to the RHC Program internal cap application and prioritization proposed in the Further Notice effective funding year 2023.185 We amend RHC Program rules to limit the application of the internal cap on multi-year commitments and upfront payments to funding years for which the total demand exceeds the remaining support available.186 We also prioritize upfront payments and the first year of multi-year commitments, and then fund the second and third years of multi-year commitments with any remaining funding in a given funding year.187 Although demand has been fully satisfied in every funding year since the adoption of the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, these changes will ensure a smoother, fairer process in the event that prioritization is ever necessary. 61. First, we amend our funding cap rules to limit the application of the internal cap to those application filing window periods during which total demand exceeds total remaining support available for the funding year.188 All commenters who discussed this proposal supported it.189 If total demand during a filing window period does not exceed total remaining support available for the funding year, the internal cap will not apply. The total remaining support available for the first filing window period of a funding year is the sum of the inflation-adjusted RHC Program aggregate cap in section 54.619a190 of 181 See ENA Healthcare Comments at 8-9. See also SHLB Reply Comments at 10 GCI Reply Comments at 18. We also reject SHLBs request to direct USAC to change its systems to bill for actual charges instead of funding commitment amounts in lieu of making a rule change. See Letter from Kristen Corra, Policy Counsel, Schools, Health  Libraries Broadband SHLB Coalition to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 17-310, 3-4 filed Jan. 17, 2023. Our comprehensive reform will more effectively streamline the Telecom Program invoicing process and better protect Program integrity than SHLBs proposal. 182 See ANTHC Comments at 2, 5 see also Windstream Comments at 8-9 Not only do Health Care Provider Support Schedules HSSs compromise the ability of USAC to administer the Telecom Program effectively and efficiently, but they also complicate the invoicing process for participating service providers, particularly those that also participate in the HCF Program, where only FCC Form 463 is used.. 183 See, e.g., TeleQuality Communications, LLC, EB-IHD-19-00028870, Order and Consent Decree, 35 FCC Rcd 503, 515 EB 2020 TeleQuality Consent Decree describing invoicing violations in which TeleQuality Communications, LLC invoiced USAC for services that were disconnected before the end of the funding period or were not actually installed and provided. 184 See ANTHC Comments at 2 requesting that changes to the invoice process mitigate administrative burdens on Tribal entities. 185 Further Notice, at 24-25, paras. 65-66. 186 Id. 187 Further Notice at 25-26, paras. 67-68. 188 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.619a, as adopted herein. 189 See PCIA Comments at 2 WNY Comments at 1 SHLB Reply Comments at 5. 852 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 our rules and the proportion of unused funding determined for use in the RHC Program pursuant to section 54.619a5.191 62. This approach will preserve the internal caps intended purpose of preventing multi-year and upfront payment requests from encroaching on the funding available for single-year requests,192 because the internal cap would only apply when the total demand exceeds the total remaining support available. No requests will be reduced, even if the internal cap is exceeded, as long as there is sufficient total funding to meet total demand. This approach will also ensure funding for single-year requests in the next funding year.193 Allowing upfront payment and multi-year commitment requests to be fully funded if funding is available for all demand in the current funding year will also alleviate demand in the next funding year given that funding multi-year commitment requests in the current funding year eliminates demand for those services under the next funding years cap. 63. Second, we amend our rules to prioritize support for current-year funding requests over future-year funding requests when the internal cap is exceeded.194 Specifically, we amend section 54.621 of our rules to fund eligible upfront payment requests and the first-year of all multi-year requests before funding the second or third year of any multi-year requests when the internal cap applies and is exceeded.195 Additionally, we amend our rules to allow the underlying contracts associated with those multi-year commitment requests that are not fully funded to be designated as evergreen.196 64. The amendment to the prioritization process we adopt today increases the chance that health care providers who requested support for upfront payments and multi-year commitments will have their current years financial need satisfied in the event that prioritization is necessary. The previous prioritization process would have resulted in some health care providers, likely those in the lower Continued from previous page 190 47 CFR  54.619a. 191 47 CFR  54.619a5. In the event that a second filing window is opened during a funding year, the total remaining support available for the second filing window is the total remaining support after allocating funding to eligible funding requests during the first filing window. 47 CFR  54.621a2. The last funding year in which there was a second filing window was funding year 2016, and a second filing window is not currently planned for future funding years given that there has been no available funding for a second filing window in recent funding years. See Wireline Competition Bureau Provides a Filing Window Period Schedule for Funding Requests Under the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund, WC Docket No. 02-60, Public Notice, 31 FCC Rcd 9588, 9591 WCB 2016 directing USAC to open a second filing window period for funding year 2016. If the total demand during a second filing window exceeds the total remaining support available for the funding year, funding for upfront payment and multi-year commitment requests submitted during the second filing window will be capped at the remaining support available within the internal cap. For example, if the internal cap for the funding year is 161 million and support for eligible upfront payments and multi-year commitments during the first filing window is 130, the remaining support available within the internal cap is 31 million. 192 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7401, para. 138 the 150 million cap did the job the Commission intended when it was established  to prevent multi-year and upfront payment requests from usurping the funding available for single-year requests for recurring services and safeguard against large fluctuations in demand for RHC Program funds. Healthcare Connect Fund Order, 27 FCC Rcd at 16802, para. 298. 193 See Alaska Communications Comments at 34 stating that any attempt to retain the internal cap must prevent multi-year and upfront payment requests from encroaching on single-year requests. 194 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.621b, as adopted herein. 195 See id. Commenters support this proposal. See PCIA Comments at 2 WNY Comments at 1. Under this approach, the second and third years of a request for a multi-year commitment that fall within the same prioritization tier would be treated equally. 196 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.621b4, as adopted herein. As noted below, such contracts must satisfy the criteria set forth in section 54.622i3ii of the Commissions rules. 47 CFR  54.622i3ii. Commenters also support this proposal. See WNY Comments at 2. 853 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 prioritization categories, losing all or a portion of their requested support for the current funding year while other health care providers receive commitments for the second and third years of multi-year commitments, even though they could request funding for these services in subsequent funding years. This change mitigates such adverse impact to those health care providers. By prioritizing support for upfront payment requests and the first year of multi-year commitment requests when the internal cap applies and is exceeded, health care providers in the lower prioritization categories will more likely receive the current years requested support. Additionally, the action we take today will further promote broadband network development led by HCF consortia that include non-rural members by lessening the impact of prioritization to those non-rural health care providers and by giving preference to upfront costs such as network construction. We recognize that this amendment will inconvenience some health care providers in the higher prioritization categories that may have to file applications in future funding years for services that otherwise would fall under the second and third year of a multi-year commitment. We conclude, however, that such concerns are outweighed by the benefit to health care providers who, without this rule change, could have their current year funding requests denied or prorated. 65. To mitigate any potential adverse impact to health care providers whose multi-year commitment requests are affected, we also amend our rules197 to allow the underlying contracts associated with those multi-year commitment requests that are not fully funded to be designated as evergreen, provided that the contracts satisfy the criteria set forth in section 54.622i3ii of the Commissions rules.198 The evergreen designation will exempt applicants from having to complete the competitive bidding process for multi-year contracts that are not initially fully funded due to our new internal cap rules when the applicant subsequently files requests for support pursuant to these contracts.199 As a result, applicants can request single or multi-year commitments pursuant to these contracts in the next funding year without going through the competitive bidding process. 66. We agree with Alaska Communications, GCI, and WNY that the internal cap prevents multi-year commitment requests from usurping funding available for single-year requests,200 and we reject requests by some commenters to eliminate the internal cap or to remove multi-year commitments from the internal cap. This latter group of commenters claims that eliminating the internal cap or removing multi-year commitments from the internal cap would encourage more multi-year commitments, which these commenters claim are more efficient for both the RHC program and individual HCPs.201 We find that retaining the current internal cap with the limitations we institute today is more fiscally responsible than eliminating the internal cap or removing multi-year commitments from the internal cap. Eliminating the cap or removing multi-year commitments from the internal cap will result in less funding being made available for single year commitments. Multi-year requests tend to be more expensive and without any constraints, those requests will make it more likely that the overall cap is exceeded. In any event, the 197 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.621b4, as adopted herein. 198 47 CFR  54.622i3ii see also Further Notice at 26, para. 69. In funding year 2018, when the Commission directed USAC to fully fund only the upfront payments and the first year of the multi-year commitments, it also directed USAC to designate the eligible underlying contracts as evergreen. See Rural Health Care Support Mechanism, WC Docket No. 02-60, 34 FCC Rcd 4136, 4138-39, para. 9 2019. 199 47 CFR  54.622i3. 200 Alaska Communications Comments at 34 Absent a cap, HCF applicants seeking multi-year commitments could artificially inflate demand, potentially harming other applicants that seek one-year funding commitments WNY Comments at 2 Based on the proposed rules we believe it would be better to keep the internal cap in place with the newly proposed rules GCI Reply Comments at 17 the Commission should not remove internal caps on funding for upfront and multi-year commitments.. 201 SHLB Comments at 14 network construction of more advanced, future-proof technologies often leads to lower ongoing costs, thus saving money for both the program and for individual HCPs. NETC Reply Comments at 4 Multi-year funding requests are immensely more efficient for both USAC and applicants.. 854 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 changes we adopt for the internal cap today will likely result in making more funding available for multi- year commitments because, going forward, the internal cap will only apply when total demand exceeds total support available and thus will not apply at all in funding years when total support available can satisfy total demand, leaving open the possibility for additional funding for multi-year commitments beyond the internal cap. 67. We also reject some commenters requests to suspend the funding prioritization system until the Commission addresses the allocation of shared network costs for consortia program participants.202 As an initial matter, we did not seek comment in the Further Notice on suspending the funding prioritization scheme. We find, however, that a rule change is not necessary for the Commission to ensure that consortium members can allocate shared network costs when some members do not receive funding due to prioritization. In any event, as discussed in the Order on Reconsideration above, our funding prioritization approach remains necessary as it will target support where it is most needed i.e., those more rural areas with greater medical shortages in cases where available program funding is exceeded in a given funding year.203 We therefore reject the requests to suspend the funding prioritization system. 68. Some commenters argued that an increase to the overall RHC Program cap is appropriate.204 We find that the current annually inflation-adjusted overall cap combined with the process to carry-forward unused funding strikes the necessary balance between providing sufficient funding to health care providers and minimizing increased burden on USF contributors.205 With the availability of carryover funding, demand has been fully satisfied since funding year 2019.206 While we continue to monitor overall Program demand, we decline to increase the overall RHC Program cap at this time. C. Technical Changes to Previously Codified RHC Rules 69. We also take this opportunity to make two minor corrections to the text of the RHC Program rules. First, we amend the text of section 54.622e1i to reflect the correct number of health care provider types that are eligible. The Rural Healthcare Connectivity Act of 2016 amended the Communications Act of 1934 to add skilled nursing facilities to the list of health care provider types eligible to receive RHC Program support.207 In response to this new law, in 2017, the Commission amended section 54.600a of its rules to reflect that skilled nursing facilities are eligible for RHC support, which increased the number of eligible health care provider types from seven to eight.208 In 202 NETC Reply Comments at 4-5 SHLB Comments at 13-14. See also Jeffrey Mitchell, Counsel, New England Telehealth Consortium NETC to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 17-310, 2 filed January 19, 2023 NETC Ex Parte at 2. 203 See supra Part III.C.2 204 See SHLB Comments at 17 ADS Comments at 5. 205 See RHC Program Cap Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 6580, para. 13. In 2018, the Commission decided to annually adjust the RHC Program funding cap to reflect inflation and established a process to carry-forward unused RHC Program funds on an annual basis for use in future funding years. See id. at 6578, para. 9. 206 See Funding Year 2019 Demand Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 2659, 2662, paras. 3, 9 Funding Year 2020 Demand Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 11696, 11699, paras. 3, 9 Wireline Competition Bureau Announces the Availability of Unused Funds to Fully Satisfy Demand for Rural Health Care Program Funding For Funding Year 2022, WC Docket No. 02-60, Public Notice, DA 22-792, 2022 WL 2965199, at 1 WCB July 22, 2022. 207 See Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, Title II  Rural Healthcare Connectivity, Pub. L. No. 114-182 2016 Rural Healthcare Connectivity Act of 2016 amending the Act to include skilled nursing facilities as a health care provider type codified at 47 U.S.C.  254h7B. Section 254 was added to the Act by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 1996 1996 Act. 208 See Rural Health Care Support Mechanism, WC Docket No. 02-60, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 32 FCC Rcd 5260 2017. See also 47 CFR  54.600a 2018. 855 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 enacting this change, the Commission did not amend a different rule addressing certifications on a Request for Services that refers to one of the seven categories set forth in the definition of health care provider.209 We now correct that omission by striking the word seven from section 54.622e1i of our rules. Striking the word seven rather than replacing it with eight is appropriate because quantifying the number of eligible health care provider types in section 54.622e1i adds no substantive benefit to RHC Program participants but could potentially lead to confusion if there are future amendments to the health care provider types eligible for the RHC Program. Second, we correct the cross-reference in section 54.622a so that it properly references section 54.622i.210 We find that there is good cause to make these changes without notice and comment because seeking comment on these technical amendments, which only serve to conform these references to the current requirements of the rules would be unnecessary.211 V. ORDER 70. By this Order, we dismiss the Applications for Review of the Bureaus guidance to the Administrator on implementation of the Rates Database212 submitted by Alaska Communications and GCI.213 Our decision above to eliminate the use of the Rates Database to calculate urban and rural rates renders these Applications for Review moot.214 VI. SECOND FURTHER NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING 71. In this Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we first propose modifications to the three rural rate determination methods in the Telecom Program, including changes to the market- based approach of Methods 1 and 2 and new evidentiary requirements for justifying cost-based rates under Method 3. We also propose to simplify urban rate rules by eliminating the standard urban distance distinction and seek specific comment on sources for urban rates as well as general comment on our urban rate rules. Next, we seek comment on reinstating the cap on support for satellite services that the Commission eliminated when it adopted the Rates Database and on amending HCF Program rules to make equipment supporting Telecom Program services eligible. In addition, to make it easier for health care providers to receive RHC Program funding as soon as they become eligible entities, we propose a conditional eligibility process to allow entities that will be eligible health care providers in the future to engage in competitive bidding and file Requests for Funding before they become eligible. We also propose to align the deadline to request a Service Provider Identification Number SPIN change with the invoice filing deadline and seek comment on a post-commitment process to amend evergreen contract dates. We conclude by seeking comment on proposed revisions to FCC Form 466 intended to improve the quality of Telecom Program data. A. Rural Rates 72. In the Order on Reconsideration above, we grant the petitions seeking reconsideration of the Telecom Program Rates Database and restore Methods 1, 2, and 3 for calculating rural rates in the 209 See 47 CFR  54.603b1i 2018 emphasis added. This section has subsequently been re-codified as 47 CFR  54.622e1i. See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7451, Appx. A. 210 See 47 CFR  54.622a currently citing to an exemption listed in paragraph j in this section despite the fact that competitive bidding exemptions are listed in section 54.622i. 211 See 5 U.S.C.  553bB see also 47 CFR  1.412c. 212 See Rates Database Implementation Letter. Because the Rates Database has been rescinded, this letter no longer has any legal effect. 213 See GCI Application for Review Alaska Communications Application for Review. 214 Because we dismiss the Applications for Review as moot, we need not determine whether the Applications for Review, which asked the Commission to review guidance by the Bureau directed to the Administrator, met the procedural requirements of section 1.115 of our rules. See 47 CFR  1.115. 856 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 Telecom Program effective for funding year 2024. Although we believe restoring Methods 1, 2, and 3 is the best of our currently available options to ensure that healthcare providers have adequate, predictable support in the short term, we also recognize that improvements to these methods may be necessary for the long term given the issues that the Commission has previously cited with respect to these rate calculation methodologies.215 Therefore, in the following sections, we propose modifications to the three methods to improve the overall calculation of rural rates, make rate calculations simpler to administer, and reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in the Telecom Program for funding year 2024 and beyond. Our proposals are similar to the now-reinstated Methods 1 through 3 in that they contain multiple ways to calculate rural rates that are applied sequentially. While we seek comment specifically on our proposed modification to the methods, at the outset we seek comment generally on alternative rural rate calculation methods. In proposing alternative rate methodologies, commenters should be specific, point the Commission to available data sources to support any alternative methodology, and explain how any alternative methodology would be more advantageous in protecting the Fund against waste, fraud, and abuse. 73. As an initial matter, we address several matters applicable to rural rates regardless of the method used. For both market-based calculations and cost-based rates, we propose that the rural rate not exceed the monthly rate in the contract or other applicable agreement between the service provider and health care provider.216 This safeguard exists in the rules related to the Rates Database217 and ensures that rural rates will drop if market prices drop. We seek comment on this proposal. Are there situations in which it would be appropriate to base support on an amount higher than the monthly rate in the contract or other applicable agreement? 74. Additionally, we propose that service providers with multi-year contracts, including evergreen contracts, continue to be required to justify rural rates only in the first year of the contract. Given that service providers would not be expected to submit additional bids within the duration of the multi-year contract, we believe it would be reasonable to exempt such contracts from requiring additional rural rates justifications during the duration of the contract. We seek comment on this proposal. We also seek comment on whether a rural rate approval for a single year contract for the same health care provider for the same service should be effective for multiple funding years to reduce administrative burdens associated with filing rural rate justifications every year. If so, for how many years should an approval be effective? 75. We seek comment on whether the Commission should offer guidance on which point in the procurement and funding cycle service providers should determine rural rates.218 The Bureau previously advised that service providers should determine the rural rate before responding to a health care providers request for bids.219 If the Commission offers further guidance, should it alter the guidance the Bureau previously offered? We also seek comment on whether additional clarification is needed regarding what constitutes comparable rural areas for determining rural rates.220 Are health care providers and service providers currently able to determine what constitute a comparable rural area? If the Commission were to offer a clarification on what constitutes comparable rural areas, what should the clarification state? 215 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7363-65, paras. 55-58. 216 See Appendix B, 47 CFR  54.605d as proposed herein. 217 See 47 CFR  54.605a. 218 See Alaska Communications Ex Parte at 4 requesting that the Commission seek comment on when a rate determination should be performed. 219 See Rural Rates Public Notice, 34 FCC Rcd at 532. 220 See 47 U.S.C.  254h1A. See also Alaska Communications Ex Parte at 3 requesting that the Commission seek comment on defining the rural area where a health care provider is located. 857 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 1. Market-Based Calculations 76. The rules that we reinstate today require health care and service providers to first calculate the rural rate by averaging rates offered by the service provider for an identical or similar service in the rural area in which the health care provider was located Method 1, and in the event the service provider does not provide such a service, the average of rates offered by carriers other than the service provider Method 2.221 We now propose alternative sequential methods for determining rural rates, which we call Method A and Method B for purposes of this Second Further Notice222 Method A The rural rate shall be the median of publicly available rates charged by other service providers223 for the same or similar services over the same distance in the rural area where the health care provider is located. Method B If there are no publicly available rates charged by other service providers for the same or similar services that is, rates that can be used under Method A, the rural rate shall be the median of the rates that the carrier actually charges to non-health care provider commercial customers for the same or similar services provided in the rural area where the health care provider is located. This proposal differs from Methods 1 and 2 in two primary respects. First, our new proposed calculations would be based on the median of inputs, rather than their average. Calculating rural rates using the median will mute the effect that a small number of abnormally high or low inputs would have on the calculated rural rate.224 We seek comment on this methodology. Would calculating rural rates using averages be preferable to using medians? If so, why? Are there other ways that we should consider calculating rural rates? 77. The second major way that our proposal varies from Methods 1 and 2 is that the default calculation in our proposal is based on rates charged by other service providers, meaning that a service provider would only be able to use its own rates to calculate the rural rate if there are no applicable rates from other service providers. This change could improve program integrity and provide administrative benefits. As to program integrity, shifting the default rural rates calculation to rates from other service providers could ensure that rural rates in the Telecom Program better reflect market conditions. A service provider would not enjoy inflated rural rates simply because it charges inflated rates to customers outside of the Telecom Program. We seek stakeholder feedback on program integrity implications of our proposal to use rates charged by other service providers as the default for calculating rural rates. Are there any concerns with service providers using competitors rates to determine rural rates instead of using their own rates? What are the benefits? Are there benefits to using the service providers own rates as the default as Method 1 does? 78. As to administration, the availability of rural rates on the Open Data platform on the Administrators website could simplify the rates determination process if the Administrator were to build a tool that allows the filer of a Request for Funding to select the specific funding requests, i.e., prices from past request that would be used as inputs to Method A. The tool would then determine the rural rate under Method A on behalf of the health care provider before it certifies its Request for Funding. Unlike the Rates Database, which we have eliminated in the Order on Reconsideration above, this automated process would not pre-determine which health care provider is in a similar rural area as the health care provider applicant. That would be left to the service provider to determine. During application review, 221Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7363, para. 54. 222 See Appendix B, 47 CFR  54.605a1 and 2 as proposed herein. 223 Other service providers are considered any service provider with a different SPIN. 224 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7366, para. 63. 858 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 the Administrator would verify that the sites from the inputs are in a similar rural area to the health care provider, just as it has done under the now reinstated Methods 1 and 2. 79. We seek comment on developing an automated process to calculate rural rates, to the extent possible, by having USACs website auto-generate the rural rate after the health care andor service provider selects sites that are in the same rural area as the HCP. Would this help alleviate administrative burdens associated with calculating rural rates? Should filers be permitted to add rural rates outside of Open Data to be included in the calculation? Are there any circumstances in which a filer should be permitted to exclude a rate even if the rate is for the same or similar services over the same distance in the rural area where the health care provider is located? Are there any disadvantages to automating the rate calculation process in this way? Would a challenge process outside of the normal appeals process be necessary? If so, how should such a challenge process operate? Do commenters have any alternative methods of administering these proposed rate methodology changes that would increase efficiency and transparency? Commenters are encouraged to provide specific suggestions and feedback on how we can best administer changes to the rates determination process. 80. We seek comment on other iterations of the proposed Methods A and B above. For instance, one alternative to our proposal would be to use the lower of the rural rates calculated under Methods A and B. This alternative would ensure that the Fund reaps the benefits of reductions in pricing from the service provider for the applicable funding request or in the overall market. We seek comment on the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. 81. We also seek comment on the rates that should be used for Methods A and B under our proposal. For Method A, are there other sources of publicly available rate information that we should consider, such as tariffed rates? Should Method A inputs be limited to data available in Open Data? Do commenters agree that the data available in Open Data would be sufficient for Program participants to determine a rural rate under Method A? If not, what additional information would be required in Open Data to make such a rate determination? For the proposed Method B, we seek comment on whether we should include the median of all of the service providers own rates for the same or similar services, including rates for USF-supported services, which are currently excluded from Method 1 calculations either in situations where there are no publicly available rates or tariffed rates outside of the service providers own rates or in all situations. For Method B, should service providers use additional information available in their own records to make a more granular similarity determination? 82. For both proposed Methods A and B, we seek comment on whether we should include both healthcare provider and non-healthcare provider commercial customers in the rural area in which the healthcare provider is located to calculate the rural rate. Do commenters have any concerns with allowing service providers to rely on all of their own rates, including health care provider rates? How should Methods A and B account for the potential price variations caused by term and volume discounts? Do commenters have any concerns that the proposed Methods would not be suitable for health care providers in Alaska? Commenters are encouraged to be specific with their concerns. 2. Cost-Based Rates 83. We propose that service providers continue to have the option to submit a cost-based rate if they cannot calculate a rural rate using Methods A or B. Under the rate determination rules we reinstate today, service providers may request approval of a cost-based rate under Method 3 from the Commission for interstate services or a state commission for intrastate services if there are no rates for the same or similar services in the rural area in which the health care provider is located, or the service provider reasonably determines that the calculated rural rate would not be compensatory.225 The Commissions rules require the service provider to submit a justification of its requested rural rate, including an 225 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.605b, as adopted herein. 859 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 itemization of the costs of providing the service requested by the eligible health care provider.226 To comply with this requirement, the request for approval of a cost-based rural rate requires service providers to include a cost study that demonstrates how the costs of providing services were allocated to RHC Program customers.227 84. In the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the Commission eliminated the cost- based method of determining rates and instead concluded that submitting a cost-based rate should serve only as a safety valve for service providers that have no other means of determining a rural rate.228 The Commission reasoned that implementation of the Rates Database made it unlikely that service providers would be unable to determine a rural rate with the data provided in the database.229 The Commission established a waiver process that allowed service providers to use a cost-based rate mechanism in extreme cases where the provider could show that the applicable rural rate from the Rates Database would result in objective, measurable economic injury.230 Now that we have eliminated the Rates Database and reinstated the previous rate determination rules, we propose to modify the cost-based rate- determination method to include specific evidentiary requirements to increase transparency in how service providers calculate cost-based rates when a rural rate cannot be calculated under Methods A or B or the carrier reasonably determines that the rural rate calculated under Methods A or B would not generate a reasonably compensatory rate. 85. We propose a revised cost-based method that will require service providers seeking approval of a cost-based rate to satisfy the same evidentiary requirements that the Commission adopted as required for waiver of the Rates Database rules in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.231 When service providers submit a cost-based rate, we propose to require service providers to include all financial data and other information to verify the service providers assertions, including, at a minimum, the following information  Company-wide and rural health care service gross investment, accumulated depreciation, deferred state and federal income taxes, and net investment capital costs by category expressed as annual figures e.g., depreciation expense, state and federal income tax expense, 226 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.605b1, as adopted herein The carrier must provide, to the state commission, for intrastate rates, or to the Commission, for interstate rates, a justification of the proposed rural rate, including an itemization of the costs of providing the requested service. 227 In 2019, the Commission released a public notice providing guidance to program applicants on what should be included in the cost study. At a minimum, the cost study required a service provider to submit information on the following a The companys total capital expenditures CAPEX and operational expenditures OPEX, with a breakdown of the total figures components e.g., depreciation, taxes, return on investment b An explanation of how the total CAPEXOPEX figure is allocated between customers, together with the resulting allocated figures, as necessary to show how the company has allocated CAPEXOPEX costs to its RHC Program customers c The companys total common costs and a breakdown of that total figures components and d An explanation of how the companys total common costs are allocated between customers, together with the resulting allocated figures, as necessary to show how the company has allocated common costs to RHC facilities and to RHC Program customers. Rural Rates Public Notice, 34 FCC Rcd 533. However, these specific evidentiary requirements were not codified. 228 The Commission eliminated the cost-based support mechanism and concluded that cost-based reviews should not be an alternative method of determining a rural rate under our rules but instead should be reserved for extreme cases where a carrier can demonstrate that determining Telecom Program support under the new rural rate rules adopted by this Report and Order would result in an objective, measurable economic injury.

We understand that stakeholders generally disfavored the evidentiary requirements for the cost-based waiver for determining rural rates because of the burdensome nature of the information requested, the possibility that the cost-based method would not provide sufficient support for those that could not calculate their rates using the Rates Database and the fact that these evidentiary requirements go far beyond the evidentiary requirements for Method 3.233 However, the Commission adopted the waiver process as a safety valve given how infrequently the cost-based method has been used in the Telecom Programs history and the small likelihood that providers could not determine the rural rate using the 232 34 FCC Rcd at 7371-72, para. 74. 233 See Alaska Communications Application for Review, WC Docket No. 17-310 at 18 filed July 30, 2020 Alaska Communications AFR. See also Application for Review of GCI Communication Corp. GCI, WC Docket No. 17- 310, at 22 filed July 30, 2020 GCI AFR arguing that the waiver process is flawed and untested and did not provide an adequate remedy for program applicants especially given the pervasiveness of the databases arbitrary results. 861 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 Rates Database.234 We believe that such a comprehensive cost-based process would likely incentivize service providers to make every effort to justify their rates under Methods A or B, which would be much simpler for both the Administrator and service providers. Nonetheless, in addition to our proposal, we seek comment on alternative evidentiary requirements that can assist the Bureau and Administrator in evaluating cost-based rates in the event that service providers have no other way of determining rates. Do commenters have any recommendations that would increase transparency and efficiency in submitting and reviewing cost-based rates? How common would it be for service providers to have to use this cost- based rates process? Are there changes that we can make to the proposed cost-based rates submission process that would mitigate administrative burdens on service providers without compromising Program integrity? How should service providers and the Bureau use the cost data to determine a cost-based rate to be charged to an individual customer? Should there be a deadline by which the Bureau must complete its cost-based rate review and issue a rate determination? If so, how would such a deadline operate in the event that a service provider submitted incomplete or inaccurate information that required additional submissions to the Bureau? Would the use of cost studies to determine maximum rural rates decrease incentives for new infrastructure investment in hard to serve areas? Do commenters have any concerns that the proposed cost-based rate would not be suitable for health care providers in Alaska? Commenters are strongly encouraged to share specific recommendations. B. Urban Rates 87. We next propose to simplify and seek further comment on future urban rate determination rules for the Telecom Program. The Telecom Program subsidizes the difference between the urban rate for a service in the health care providers State, which must be reasonably comparable to the rates charged for similar services in urban areas in that State, and the rural rate, which is the rate for similar services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas in the State.235 The rules that we restore on reconsideration today state that urban rates shall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate charged to a commercial customer for a functionally similar service in any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that state.236 Following the decision in todays Order on Reconsideration to eliminate the Rates Database and restore the previous rules for determining urban rates effective funding year 2024, we propose to simplify the urban rate rule by eliminating the standard urban distance distinction from it and now seek comment on whether any additional changes to those rules are warranted. 88. Standard urban distance. The rules that we reinstate today provide that, if the service is provided over a distance greater than the standard urban distance, which is the average of the longest diameters of all cities with a population of 50,000 or more within a state, the urban rate is the rate no higher than the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate provided over the standard urban distance.237 The Promoting Telehealth Report and Order eliminated the standard urban distance distinction in adopting the Rates Database.238 We propose to eliminate this distinction between services provided over and within the standard urban distance and to base all urban rates calculations on rates provided in a city, rather than over the standard urban distance. We expect that eliminating this distinction will simplify the process for determining an urban rate and will not adversely impact most health care providers because 234 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7369, para. 70. 235 47 U.S.C.  254h1A. 236 47 CFR  54.605a 2018.

Compare to Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.604a, as adopted herein if the distance is less than or equal to the standard urban distance, the urban rate for that service shall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate charged to a commercial customer for a functionally similar service in any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that state. emphasis added. 238 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7362-63, para. 52. 862 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 few Telecom Program participants calculate urban rates using the standard urban distance. We seek comment on the impact that this would have on urban rates and administrative burdens. Before the adoption of the Rates Database, how common was it to base urban rates calculations on services in a city rather than services over the standard urban distance? Would urban rates increase unduly if we make this change? We seek comment below on whether to change the standard for urban from a city with a population of at least 50,000. Will changes to the standard for urban in conjunction with the elimination of the standard urban distance cause an increase in urban rates? 89. Sources of urban rates. Under the pre-funding year 2020 urban rate rules that we reinstate today, documentation may be required to substantiate the applicable urban rate.239 The urban rate is determined by the health care provider, often with the assistance of a consultant or carrier, and reported on the FCC Form 466. To document the urban rate, health care providers may use tariff pages, contracts, a letter on company letterhead from the urban service provider, rate pricing information printed from the urban service providers website or similar documentation showing how the urban rate was obtained.240 In the alternative, health care providers have historically utilized the urban rates listed on the Administrators website for certain services in certain states.241 These urban rates are determined by reviewing tariff information on file with the Commission.242 One advantage of utilizing the urban rates posted to the Administrators website is that health care providers did not need to provide additional documentation on their FCC Form 466. With the Commissions decision to eliminate the Rates Database, should the Administrator post urban rates as it did prior to the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order or is the posting of urban rates of limited utility and unnecessary? Are there changes or updates the Administrator should make to the urban rates it posts on its website? While the Commission has made the decision to eliminate the Rates Database, the database contains urban rates that were collected as part of the database creation process. If the Administrator resumes posting urban rates, should the urban rates currently found in the Rates Database be included in the posted list, or have too many anomalies been identified that will preclude the use of those rates by participants in the Telecom Program? 90. On a forward going basis, should there be any changes to the now-reinstated urban rate rules? When exploring additional sources of urban rates, should the Commission allow health care providers to use the median of urban rates in the Rates Database as the urban rate? Parties lodging complaints about the use of the Rates Database to determine rural rates had relatively few complaints about its use to determine urban rates.243 Should the Commission require the Administrator to maintain a Rates Database for urban rates and require that urban rates be calculated utilizing the Rates Database? Alternatively, should a rate survey be used to determine current urban rates instead of relying on the Administrator to determine and post rates? If so, after the initial compilation of the survey, how often should it be updated? Are there any additional factors that we should take into account for calculating urban rates in the Telecom Program? 91. Threshold for urban. The standard for urban of being functionally similar service in any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that state that we reinstate today244 was originally adopted in 2003.245 Should the Commission maintain 50,000 as the population threshold for determining 239 See FCC Form 466 Instructions at 8 2019. 240 See Dataconnex, LLC, Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Order, 33 FCC Rcd 1575, 1580, para. 10 2018 see also FCC Form 466 Instructions, at 8 2019. 241 These rates were frequently referred to as safe harbor urban rates.

Is there another population number that better captures the full spectrum of urban areas or is there a value collected by a different agency that better captures the picture of an urban area? C. Network Function 92. We next seek comment on two matters related to how networks function. First, we seek comment on reinstating the cap on support for satellite services that was in place before the adoption of the Rates Database. We then seek comment on the eligibility in the HCF Program of equipment that supports services funded in the Telecom Program. 1. Satellite Services 93. We seek comment on reinstating the cap on support for satellite services in the Telecom Program at the amount of support the health care provider would have received for similar terrestrial- based services.246 When the Commission established the RHC Program, satellite service was the only available telecommunications service available in some rural areas. However, rural health care providers in those areas generally did not receive Telecom Program discounts because satellite service rates typically did not vary between urban and rural areas.247 In 2003, the Commission revised its rules to allow eligible rural health care providers to base Telecom Program support for satellite services on urban rates for functionally similar wireline services.248 However, because satellite services were often significantly more expensive than terrestrial-based services, in rural areas where a functionally similar terrestrial-based service was available the Commission capped support for satellite service at the amount that the health care provider would receive had it chosen the terrestrial-based service.249 If an eligible rural health care provider chose a satellite-based service that was more expensive than the available equivalent terrestrial-base service, the health care provider was responsible for the additional cost.250 In the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the Commission eliminated this cap, effective for funding year 2020, explaining that the limitation on support for satellite services was no longer necessary because rural rates would be determined by the Rates Database and costs for satellite services were decreasing, while also acknowledging that eliminating the cap furthered technological neutrality and that improvements to competitive bidding rules would reduce the need for the cap.251 94. We seek comment on reinstating the cap on satellite services at the lower of the satellite service rate or the terrestrial service rate and allow rural health care providers to receive discounts for satellite service up to the amount providers would have received if they purchased functionally similar terrestrial-based alternatives, even where terrestrial-based services are available. It appears that the constraints on the price of satellite services that the Commission predicted when it eliminated the cap on satellite services did not come into fruition. Since the elimination of the cap and the waiver of the rates database, Telecom Program support for satellite services has increased significantly. The table below shows that commitments for satellite services dipped slightly in funding year 2020 but increased significantly after that.252 246 See 47 CFR  54.609d 2018 see also Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7378-79, paras. 92-97 Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR  54.609d, as adopted herein. 247 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7379, para. 92 citing Rural Health Care Support Mechanism, WC Docket No. 02-60, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 17 FCC Rcd 7806, 7820, para. 38 2002. 248 2003 Internet Access Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 24568, paras. 43-44 47 CFR  54.609 2018. 249 2003 Internet Access Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 24568, para. 44 47 CFR  54.609d 2018. 250 47 CFR  47.609d3 2018. 251 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7380-81, para. 97. 252 Letter from Mark Sweeney, Vice President, Universal Service Administrative Company, to Jodie Griffin, Chief, Telecommunications Access Policy Division, Wireline Competition Bureau and Bryan Boyle, Deputy Chief, Telecommunications Access Policy Division, Wireline Competition Bureau, WC Docket 17-310 filed Jan. 4, 2023. 864 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 Commitments for Satellite Services Funding Years 2019-22 Commitment Funding Year Amount 2019 28,726,457 2020 26,583,278 2021 39,487,136 2022 60,098,460 95. This steady growth in demand for satellite services may demonstrate the need to reinstitute the satellite funding cap. Without the constraints on support for satellite services imposed by the Rates Database, it appears that commitments for satellite services could increase to an unsustainable level. As an initial matter, we seek comment on the significance of the increase in commitments for satellite services. Does this increase reflect that the prices charged for satellite services in the Telecom Program increased after the cap was eliminated or are health care providers selecting satellite services because those services are now more competitive with terrestrial-based services? Are service providers less likely to bid on or upgrade networks for terrestrial services because the cap was lifted? Have rates for satellite services due to the availability of low Earth orbit LEO satellites dropped enough to make the cap no longer necessary? If that is the case, why did demand for satellite services increase so significantly in recent years? Are there other factors we should consider in determining whether to retain the cap on support for satellite services? For example, is it appropriate to apply the cap in cases where satellite service provides redundancy in the absence of alternative terrestrial-based route diversity? Could reinstatement of the cap discourage investment in LEO satellites? What impact should the RHC Programs historical preference for technological neutrality and the fact that there previously was a cap on satellite services have on this determination? If we reinstitute this cap, are there other changes we should make to it? Should the Commission not apply the cap to funding requests supported by satellite service contracts that were entered into before reinstatement of the cap? Do commenters in Alaska have any concerns with reinstating the cap, given the importance of satellite service in Alaska? 2. HCF Program Eligible Equipment 96. We also seek comment on whether we should amend HCF Program rules to make eligible network equipment necessary to make functional an eligible service supported under the Telecom Program.253 Current HCF Program rules restrict the eligibility of network equipment for individual applicants to equipment necessary to make functional an eligible service supported under the HCF Program.254 There is no analogous rule in the Telecom Program that provides support for network equipment. Should we consider allowing HCF-eligible equipment to support both HCF and Telecom Program services? Would such a change improve the reliability of Telecom Program supported services? If we were to make network equipment for Telecom Program supported services eligible, what would the financial impact be on the RHC Program? Would HCF Program funding for equipment supporting Telecom Program services reduce Telecom Program expenditures? Expanding the universe of supported equipment would make it more likely that the internal cap would be exceeded. Given the significantly higher discount rates already offered in the Telecom Program, would it be sensible to increase the likelihood of exceeding the internal cap to provide HCF Program funding to support networks that 253 See Jeffrey Mitchell, Counsel, ADS Advanced Data Services, Inc. ADS to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 17-310, 2 filed January 13, 2023 ADS Ex Parte. 254 See 47 CFR  54.613a. 865 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 traditionally have been supported in the Telecom Program only? If we implement this change, are there additional safeguards we should consider? D. Conditional Approval of Eligibility for Future Eligible Heath Care Providers 97. We propose to amend RHC Program rules for determining eligibility to allow entities that are not yet but will become eligible health care providers in the near future to begin receiving RHC Program funding shortly after they become eligible.255 Under the Bureau-level Hope Community Order, entities that are not yet eligible health care providers cannot receive an eligibility approval, which is a prerequisite to initiating competitive bidding and filing a Request for Funding, until they are eligible health care providers.256 As a result of this restriction, if a health care provider does not receive an eligibility approval in time to complete competitive bidding and file a Request for Funding by the close of the application filing window on April 1,257 the health care provider would have to wait until a subsequent funding year to receive RHC Program funding, which could result in a delay of a full calendar year.258 98. In order to address this delay in funding, we propose to amend sections 54.601 and 54.622 of our rules to allow entities that will soon be eligible health care providers to request and receive a conditional approval of eligibility.259 Once the Administrator approves an applicants conditional eligibility, the applicant could proceed to conduct competitive bidding and submit a Request for Funding during the application filing window. To ensure that no funding is disbursed for entities that are not yet eligible, the Administrator would not issue a funding decision for the funding request until the entity updates its eligibility request by providing documentation showing that it is an eligible health care 255 Eligible health care providers, as defined in section 254h7B of the Communications Act and implemented in the Commissions rules, are limited to public or non-profit entities falling into one of the following categories 1 post-secondary educational institutions offering health care instruction, teaching hospitals, and medical schools 2 community health centers or health centers providing health care to migrants 3 local health departments or agencies 4 community mental health centers 5 not-for-profit hospitals 6 rural health clinics 7 skilled nursing facilities and 8 consortia of health care providers consisting of one or more entities falling into the first seven categories. See 47 U.S.C.  254h1A, h2A, h4, h7B 47 CFR  54.600b, 54.601a. 256 Hope Community Resources, Inc. Barrow MH, Rural Health Care Universal Service Support Mechanism, WC Docket No. 02-60, Order, 31 FCC Rcd 7883, 7887-88, para. 9 WCB 2016 Hope Community Order while Hope Community asserts the Barrow site provides outpatient mental health services, the prospective language  indicate that outpatient services will be provided at a future time, and we affirm the Administrators decision and find that Hope Barrow did not demonstrate that it was eligible as a community mental health center, at the time of its FCC Form 465 submission for funding year 2013, and therefore was ineligible to receive RHC Telecommunications Program support.. 257 47 CFR  54.621a1. 258 See Letter from Kristen Corra, Policy Counsel, SHLB, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 17-310, at 4 filed Dec. 9, 2022 SHLB Reply Comments at 11. Under current rules, if a health care provider becomes an eligible health care provider and receives an eligibility approval on March 5, 2024, for example, there would not be enough time to conduct competitive bidding, which includes a minimum 28-day waiting period for posting an FCC Form 461 or 465 on the Administrators website, before the April 1, 2024 close of the application filing window for funding year 2024. The health care provider would have to wait until funding year 2025, which begins on July 1, 2025, to receive RHC Program funding. When the Hope Community Order was adopted, there was a rolling application deadline, which allowed entities to begin receiving RHC Program funding within months of becoming eligible health care providers. See Hope Community Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 7885, para. 4. After receiving an eligibility approval, the health care provider could wait the required 28 days for competitive bidding and then file a Request for Funding any time during the funding year. 259 See infra Appendix B, 47 CFR  54.601c. In connection with the proposed amendments to section 54.601 of the Commissions rules, we also propose to amend section 54.622e1i of the Commissions rules to allow applicants seeking conditional approval of eligibility to certify their eligibility when submitting a Request for Services. See infra Appendix B, 47 CFR  54.622e1i. 866 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 provider and the Administrator issues a final eligibility approval. The conditional approval of eligibility process would use the same forms used to request eligibility approvals, which are the FCC Form 460 Eligibility and Registration Form in the HCF Program and the FCC Form 465 Description of Services Requested and Certification Form in the Telecom Program. 99. We seek comment on the potential impact of and mechanics of the proposed rule changes. How many entities would be impacted by this change? Are there any potential problems associated with this proposal or any potential negative impact on the overall RHC Program? Are any additional safeguards necessary beyond the restriction against the Administrator issuing funding commitments before an entity receives a final eligibility approval? Are there alternatives to our conditional eligibility proposal that would more effectively allow entities that are not yet eligible health care providers to receive RHC Program funding? Finally, are there any RHC Program rule changes beyond those that we propose that would be needed to implement our conditional eligibility proposal? E. Administrative Deadlines 100. We next address two matters involving RHC Program deadlines. We propose to push back the deadline for requesting Service Provider Identification Number SPIN changes to align with the invoice deadline. We also seek comment on whether a mechanism to allow post-commitment changes to evergreen contract dates is necessary. 1. Service Provider Identification Number Change Deadlines 101. We propose to revise the current deadline for requesting Service Provider Identification Number SPIN changes from the service delivery deadline to the invoice filing deadline. A SPIN is a unique number that the Administrator assigns to an eligible service provider seeking to participate in the universal service support programs.260 An applicant under the HCF Program or Telecom Program may request either a corrective SPIN change in cases not involving a change to the service provider associated with the applicants funding request number or operational SPIN change in cases involving a change to the service provider associated with the applicants funding request number.261 The current filing deadline to submit a SPIN change request is no later than the service delivery deadline, which, with limited exceptions, is June 30 of the funding year for which program support is sought.262 The Commission established a SPIN change deadline aligned with the service delivery deadline to ensure consistency with the E-Rate Program and reduce the number of requests for extension of the invoice deadline.263 102. SHLB requests that the Commission change the current deadline to make a corrective SPIN change from the service delivery deadline to the invoice filing deadline, which typically falls on October 28.264 SHLB maintains that the nature of corrective SPIN changes creates a recurring hardship 260 To obtain a SPIN, a service provider must file an FCC Form 498 with the Administrator, which refers to a providers SPIN as its 498 ID. See USAC, Obtain a 498 ID, httpswww.usac.orgrural-health-careservice- providersstep-1-participating-in-the-rhc-program last visited Jan. 26, 2023. 261 47 CFR  54.625a, b. For example, a corrective SPIN change is requested to correct ministerial errors or update a SPIN that resulted from a merger or acquisition of companies, and an operational SPIN change is requested when the applicant has a legitimate reason to change service providers, as in the case of a breach of contract. Id. The Commission adopted RHC Program SPIN change rules modeled after those of the E-Rate Program in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order. See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7426-27, paras. 197-99. 262 Id.  54.625c. The service delivery deadline is defined in section 54.626a of the Commissions rules. Id.  54.626a. 263 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7427, paras. 198-99. 264 SHLB January 17, 2023 Ex Parte. The invoice filing deadline is 120 days after the later of 1 the service delivery deadline, or 2 the date of a revised funding commitment letter issued pursuant to an approved post- continued. 867 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 for applicants unable to meet the deadline which, in turn, results in deadline waiver requests filed with the Commission.265 According to SHLB, two commonly recurring situations support a change to the corrective SPIN change deadline 1 mergers and acquisitions that can occur at any time during the funding year and 2 a service provider that assigns one of its multiple SPINs to a funding request without advising the healthcare provider as to the correct SPIN before invoicing begins, a situation that, in many instances, occurs after the service delivery deadline has passed.266 SHLB maintains that changing the deadline to request a corrective SPIN change to October 28 will provide the Administrator with sufficient time to process the change request without the need for applicants to request deadline waivers from the Commission.267 103. We tentatively agree with SHLB that the current deadline for requesting corrective SPIN changes imposes unnecessary burdens that a later-in-time deadline will largely eliminate. Delaying the deadline by 120 days from June 30 to October 28 in most cases would reduce the need for applicants to seek, and for the Commission to address, waivers of the current corrective SPIN change deadline that result from the types of situations described by SHLB, while still maintaining an administratively reasonable date by which such change requests must be made. Although SHLB focused its request on corrective SPIN changes only, we conclude that it may be needlessly confusing to establish two different SPIN change request deadlines depending on whether the request is corrective or operational in nature. Accordingly, we propose to change the deadline for requesting both corrective and operational SPIN changes from the current service delivery deadline to the invoicing filing deadline.268 We seek comment on this proposal. Are there other benefits to this change? We anticipate that one potentially undesirable consequence of this change is that it may cause Program participants to delay in filing SPIN change requests, which could result in Program participants missing the invoice deadline. If the SPIN change deadline is moved to the invoice deadline and the health care provider files a SPIN change request so close to the deadline that the Administrator cannot process the request before the invoice deadline, the health care provider will not be able to submit invoices. Does the flexibility this change would offer to health care providers justify the disadvantage to health care providers who are unable to invoice because they filed a SPIN change request too close to the deadline? Parties often indicate that alignment between RHC Program rules and E-Rate Program rules eliminates confusion. Would bringing these deadlines out of alignment create confusion? Are there other reasons not to adopt the same deadline for both corrective and operational SPIN changes? 2. Evergreen Contract Date Changes 104. We seek comment on whether there should be a process for health care providers to change evergreen contract dates following a funding commitment. Evergreen contracts are multi-year agreements under which covered services are exempt from the competitive bidding requirements for the life of the contract.269 When the Administrator issues a funding commitment letter, it sets the period for an evergreen contract based on the estimated service start and end dates provided by the health care provider on the FCC Form 462.270 However, services sometimes start after the estimated service start Continued from previous page commitment request made by the applicant or service provider or a successful appeal of a previously denied or reduced funding request. 47 CFR  54.627a. 265 SHLB Jan. 17, 2023 Ex Parte at 4. 266 Id. at 5. 267 Id. 268 See Appendix B, 47 CFR  54.625 as proposed herein. 269 47 CFR  54.622i3. To be designated an evergreen contract by the Administrator, a contact must be entered into as a result of competitive bidding, contain certain contractual terms, and meet other requirements. Id.  54.622i3ii. 270 See SHLB Jan. 19, 2023 Ex Parte at 4-5. 868 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 date, which means that the evergreen status of the contract expires before it would have if the evergreen designation period was based on the actual service start date.271 We seek comment on whether there should be a means for a healthcare provider to change evergreen contract dates. Is such an alternative necessary and, if so, how could it be accomplished? Would an alternative means require a change in our rules or could our current rules be interpreted to allow for evergreen contract date changes? What would be the impact of such a change on the duration of evergreen contracts? Would allowing program participants to change evergreen contract dates make it more difficult for the Administrator to process funding requests submitted pursuant to such contracts? F. FCC Form 466 105. We next seek comment on proposed revisions to the Funding Request and Certification Form FCC Form 466, including service-specific details that could both improve the accuracy of similar service categorizations under the existing Method 1 and Method 2, or the alternatives we propose in this Second Further Notice, and also result in more accurate cost-based rates. To ensure the reporting of accurate data, we propose to begin collecting this data from service providers because they are in the best position to furnish it. 106. In the Further Notice, we sought general comment on both existing Telecom Program data collected through current program forms as well as potential changes to the categorization and details of Telecom Program services and data reported on the FCC Form 466.272 Certain data currently collected appears to be too vague and fails to capture details of the purchased services, resulting in significantly different monthly rates for services broadly categorized that report comparable bandwidths but likely vary significantly.273 We requested feedback on updating the Telecom Programs categorization of services to more accurately reflect the functionality and cost of services purchased by incorporating data points such as details of service level agreements SLAs.274 We also sought comment on collecting data that would classify services based upon functionality, regardless of the commercial name used by the service provider to describe the service.275 We then sought general comment on revisions to the FCC Form 466 and other Telecom Program forms and corresponding USAC online portals that would improve the accuracy of urban and rural rate determinations and ensure program integrity.276 107. Commenters agreed that collecting more detailed data would result in more accurate categorization of services purchased by health care providers and improve program transparency.277 Alaska Communications agreed that service categorizations should be more granular and explained that services broadly categorized as dedicated include a range of services and features, particularly security and reliability, that significantly impact rates.278 Alaska Communications also noted that the factors identified in the Further Notice can have a profound effect on the functionality of the service from the perspective of the end user.279 GCI suggested that the Commission could collect data on network type, prioritization, and term and volume discounts.280 GCI also argued that the Commission should collect 271 See id. at 5. 272 Further Notice at 14-17, paras. 35-43. 273 Id. at 15, para. 36. 274 Id. at 15-16, paras. 37, 39. 275 Id. at 16, para. 38. 276 Id. at 16-17, para 41. 277 See ANHB Comments at 7 ANTHC Comments at 3 GCI Comments at 6, 53. 278 Alaska Communications Comments at 19-20 279 Id. at 18-19. 280 GCI Comments at 54. 869 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 data on services purchased rather than requiring healthcare providers to submit highly detailed forms when requesting service.281 108. We propose revisions to the FCC Form 466 to improve the quality, consistency, and level of detail of RHC Program data. Improved data will also increase the accuracy of rural rates calculated through the current three rate determination methods or through any rate determination process that is established in the future. Through our continued review of data currently collected on the FCC Form 466 we have identified five primary issues impacting the ability to calculate rates 1 services reported by healthcare providers are not defined by a single factor such as technology or speed 2 some reported rates are based on distance whereas others are not 3 value-added services beyond data transmission are not reported 4 bundled prices offered by service providers make apples-to-apples rate comparisons difficult and 5 the form does not measure the impact of SLAs on the rates offered. 109. To address these issues and collect more detailed, accurate data, we propose to revise the FCC Form 466 to collect more granular information about the services purchased by health care providers. We propose to collect the following service details for each connection endpoint.282 We seek comment on collecting this data on the FCC Form 466 and welcome comments on additional or alternative service data that could improve the accuracy and fairness of Telecom Program rates. We especially request recommendations for additional individual descriptors for the items listed below. The following items are being considered  Contract Type. In many instances services reimbursed under the RHC Program are often part of a contract that bundles many services together. We propose adding a field that would indicate if the underlying contract includes a bundle and what services the bundle covers. Data collected would include the total number of end points serviced, an indicator of the geographic region of coverage, the contracts duration, discounts and service level agreements that apply to the contract, and the contracts total price including RHC supported services.  Service Details - Connection Endpoint Information. There would be one entry for each endpoint. o Location of Endpoint  Geographically identifiable latitude and longitude. o Distance If Applicable  The distance would be in line miles from this endpoint to the far termination endpoint of the link or the central server node. This would be reported if the service provider uses it in the price calculation for this item. This field would be reported in line miles and not straight-line or crow fly miles. o Connectivity  Point-to-Point, Point-to-Multipoint, Multipoint-to-Multipoint o Application  Voice, Data, or Both o Service or Product  This is the service at the Endpoint. The user would select from the following options Link a point-to-point transmission, Device at an endpoint for a link, such as a router or switch other network-supporting equipment, or Service provided capabilities using the Links and Devices. o Equipment VendorModel  If a device or other equipment is used to extend the eligible service to the endpoint, the user would list it here. All devices would be required to be listed. 281 Id. at 6, 54. 282 We define a connection endpoint to mean termination points set up as part of the requested communication service. For example, a request for a service based upon an MPLS solution could have 10 termination points for several rural clinics, a central hospital, and a diagnostic center. Under our proposal, each of the ten connection endpoints would be reported separately. For a simple point-to-point 11 connection, two endpoints would be reported. Additionally, an end point can be a location where a separate device, such as a repeater, modem, router, switch, or other supporting service, such as a server, monitoring device, etc., is located that is part of the contract. 870 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 o Technology  The user would report the technology at the endpoint selecting from items such as DSL Digital Subscriber Line, DOCSIS Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications, PON Passive Optimal Network, GPON Gigabit Passive Optical Network and its variants, and similar, as well as Other Describe and NA. o Bandwidth DownUp  This would be expressed in Mbps. o SLA Coverage  The user would select Yes or No to indicate if this endpoint is covered. o Access Media  The user would describe the transmission media that is present at the termination of the endpoint at each individual facility. This can often, but not always, be considered the last mile. The user would select from copper, cable, microwave, fiber, high Earth orbit satellite, LEO satellite, power line, other, and NA. o Monthly Price  This field contains the monthly price in dollars and cents. This price would not include any uplift for SLA coverage, which will be collected elsewhere in the form. If the overall contract price is for a service such as MPLS, the price for each endpoint would be a pro-rated amount associated with each endpoint. Any service portion that cannot be associated with an endpoint, such as MPLS management, would be separately reported as an individual line items in the Additional Services and Differentiators section. MPLS and similar multi-point solutions would not be reported as a single item. These services would be pro-rated to individual endpoints.  Additional Services and Differentiators  This question would only be used if the service cannot be described in the Service Details question. o Service Name  This would be a free text descriptor for the providers name of this item. o Class  This would be a product, service, or differentiator not listed in the Service Details section because it is not associated with a single endpoint. o Coverage Scope  This field would refer to the scope of the network and contract that this item covers. o Period  This field would indicate the period length in months over which this item will occur. For example, if an Installation service is provided for the first year and one-half is part of the contract, 18 months would be shown. o SLA Coverage  The user would provide a Yes or No answer to indicate if this servicedifferentiator is covered under an SLA. o Monthly Price  This would be expressed in dollars and cents. The provider would pro-rate the monthly average cost for each item if the overall contract price is a single number. 110. We also propose to collect SLA details on the FCC Form 466, which currently captures whether there is an SLA, but does not collect specific details about it. The specifics of an SLA appear to significantly impact telecommunications service rates and therefore are likely to be a key factor when determining whether services are similar. SLAs are typically sold at varying levels sometimes with descriptors such as Gold, Silver, or Bronze and include availability and reliability metrics, service maintenance and management, delineations of service provider and customer responsibilities, and penalties for non-performance. We seek comment on adding the following fields to the FCC Form 466 and also seek comment on any additional SLA data that could improve the accuracy and fairness of Telecom Program rural rates, with one line for each SLA coverage area or item  Target Measurement  The user would report the item or class of items to be measured such as Availability Network Level Outage, Availability Link or Endpoint Level Outage, RepairRestore Times MTTR  Mean Time To Repair, or On Site Spares Response Time for Equipment Under Contract.  SLA Level  High, Medium, or Low that may correspond to individual provider schemes, such as o Bronze, Silver, Gold. 871 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 o Basic, Standard, Premium. o As classified by any system the service provider may use.  What Functions are Covered? o The user selects between Operations, Performance, Maintenance, Install, Administration, and Compliance.  Period  The user would indicate the period length in months over which this item will occur. For example, if an Installation service is provided for 18 months, then 18 months would be shown.  Penalties For Non-Performance? YesNo  The user would indicate whether there are specific monetary or other penalties for carrier non-performance of specific SLA requirements written in the contract. The user would select from a drop-down menu. General statements of intent would not constitute a penalty.  SLA Scope  The user would report the scope of the contract that this item covers. Examples of options filers would select from include Performance what is delivered, Operations how it is managed, and Maintenance how it is repaired.  Description of Target SLA Measurement  An optional free text field the provider could use to enter further clarification for the specific SLA item.  Price Uplift  The user would report the increase to the contract service price usually represented as a percentage that the SLA impacts. If it is not a separate line item in the contract, then the price would be estimated andor pro-rated by the provider over the period and scope of SLA coverage. 111. We seek comment on whether we should apply the proposed revisions to FCC Form 466 to the HCF Funding Request Form FCC Form 462 for consistency. What are the benefits andor drawbacks of revising FCC Form 462 to collect more granular service data? 112. Service Provider Filing. We propose to require service providers to report the technical service details described above on the FCC Form 466. In the Further Notice, we sought comment on whether service providers should report certain technical information about services purchased that rural health care providers either cannot access or lack the technical expertise to report.283 Commenters expressed concerns about increasing technical reporting burdens on healthcare providers. GCI argued that any new collection process should not burden rural health care providers, who are often not well positioned to supply technical and granular details about the services they need, and suggested collecting additional data through the FCC Form 466.284 Alaska Communications acknowledged that reporting technical service data would be complicated for health care providers.285 ANHB and ANTHC both supported increased data collection but cautioned against increasing reporting burdens on Tribal and other health care providers.286 113. We agree with commenters that proposed increases in the level of detailed technical data required on the FCC Form 466 would likely exceed the technical expertise of most health care providers. The service providers are in the best position to understand the difference between a commercial term and a functional capability as well as the difference between a capability and the underlying technology. We therefore propose that service providers input service information into the FCC Form 466. We tentatively conclude that shifting the responsibility for providing technical details to the service provider would reduce burdens on healthcare providers and improve data quality and consistency. We propose that service providers provide the technical connection endpoint data listed above as well as any other 283 Further Notice at 17, para. 43. 284 GCI Comments at 54. 285 Alaska Communications Comments at 19-20. 286 ANHB Comments at 7 ANTHC Comments at 4. 872 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 technical service data that is recommended by commenters and ultimately adopted by the Commission as part of this proceeding. Additionally, we propose that the service providers include the actual contract as an attachment to the FCC Form 466. This would be treated confidentially and would document the carriers answers in an official company document. To ensure the accuracy of the information provided, we propose that the service provider certify to the accuracy of service provider-supplied information. We seek comment on these proposals. 114. We also seek comment on the logistics of service providers filling out portions of the FCC Form 466. We propose that the FCC Form 466 be transferred to the service provider after the health care provider completes the certifications on its portion of the FCC Form 466. We seek comment on how service providers completing part of the FCC Form 466 would impact program deadlines. Should the filing window close denote the health care providers deadline for completing its portion of the FCC Form 466? If so, how much time should service providers have to complete their portion of it? Finally, we seek comment on the extent to which there might be a miscommunication between health care and service providers about the requested services. In limited circumstances, service providers may be selected to provide RHC Program supported services without submitting a bid in response to an RFP.287 If there is no contract, how can we ensure that health care providers and service providers agree as to the specific services that will be provided? G. Digital Equity and Inclusion 115. The Commission, as part of its continuing effort to advance digital equity for all,288 including people of color, persons with disabilities, persons who live in rural or Tribal areas, and others who are or have been historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality, invites comment on any equity-related considerations289 and benefits if any that may be associated with the proposals and issues discussed herein. Specifically, we seek comment on how our proposals may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, as well the scope of the Commissions relevant legal authority. VII. PROCEDURAL MATTERS 116. Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended RFA,290 requires that an agency prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for notice-and-comment rulemaking proceedings, unless the agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a 287 For example, if a health care provider does not receive responsive bids to its RFP, it may use a pre-existing contract as a standing bid.

Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements for Small Entities. The reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements proposed in this Further Notice likely would positively and negatively financially impact both large and small entities, including healthcare providers and service providers, and any resulting financial burdens may disproportionately impact small entities given their typically more limited resources. In weighing the likely financial benefits and burdens of our proposed requirements, however, we have determined that our proposed changes would result in more equitable, effective, efficient, clear, and predictable distribution of RHC support, far outweighing any resultant financial burdens on small entity participants.

Dortch Secretary 877 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 APPENDIX A FINAL RULES For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the Federal Communications Commission amends 47 CFR part 54 to read as follows PART 54  UNIVERSAL SERVICE 1. The authority citation for part 54 continues to read as follows Authority 47 U.S.C.  151, 154i, 155, 201, 205, 214, 219, 220, 254, 303r, 403, and 1302 unless otherwise noted. 2. Amend  54.604 to read as follows  54.604 Determining the urban rate. a Effective funding year 2024, if a rural health care provider requests support for an eligible service to be funded from the Telecommunications Program that is to be provided over a distance that is less than or equal to the standard urban distance, as defined in paragraph c of this section, for the state in which it is located, the urban rate for that service shall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate charged to a commercial customer for a functionally similar service in any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that state, calculated as if it were provided between two points within the city. b If a rural health care provider requests an eligible service to be provided over a distance that is greater than the standard urban distance, as defined in paragraph c of this section, for the state in which it is located, the urban rate for that service shall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or publicly- available rate charged to a commercial customer for a functionally similar service provided over the standard urban distance in any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that state, calculated as if the service were provided between two points within the city. c The standard urban distance for a state is the average of the longest diameters of all cities with a population of 50,000 or more within the state. d The Administrator shall calculate the standard urban distance and shall post the standard urban distance and the maximum supported distance for each state on its website. 3. Amend  54.605 to read as follows  54.605 Determining the rural rate. a Effective funding year 2024, the rural rate shall be the average of the rates actually being charged to commercial customers, other than health care providers, for identical or similar services provided by the telecommunications carrier providing the service in the rural area in which the health care provider is located. The rates included in this average shall be for services provided over the same distance as the eligible service. The rates averaged to calculate the rural rate must not include any rates reduced by universal service support mechanisms. The rural rate shall be used as described in this subpart to determine the credit or reimbursement due to a telecommunications carrier that provides eligible telecommunications services to eligible health care providers. b If the telecommunications carrier serving the health care provider is not providing any identical or similar services in the rural area, then the rural rate shall be the average of the tariffed and other 878 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 publicly available rates, not including any rates reduced by universal service programs, charged for the same or similar services in that rural area over the same distance as the eligible service by other carriers. If there are no tariffed or publicly available rates for such services in that rural area, or if the carrier reasonably determines that this method for calculating the rural rate is unfair, then the carrier shall submit for the state commissions approval, for intrastate rates, or for the Commissions approval, for interstate rates, a cost-based rate for the provision of the service in the most economically efficient, reasonably available manner. 1 The carrier must provide, to the state commission, for intrastate rates, or to the Commission, for interstate rates, a justification of the proposed rural rate, including an itemization of the costs of providing the requested service. 2 The carrier must provide such information periodically thereafter as required, by the state commission for intrastate rates or the Commission for interstate rates. In doing so, the carrier much take into account anticipated and actual demand for telecommunications services by all customers who will use the facilities over which services are being provided to eligible health care providers. 4. Amend  54.619 by revising paragraph a to read as follows  54.619 Cap. a Amount of the annual cap. The aggregate annual cap on federal universal service support for health care providers shall be 571 million per funding year. When total demand during a filing window period exceeds the total remaining support available for the funding year, an internal cap of 150 million per funding year for upfront payments and multi-year commitments under the Healthcare Connect Fund Program shall apply. 1    2    3    4    5    5. Amend  54.621 by revising subsection b to read as follows  54.621 Filing window for requests and prioritization of support. a     b Prioritization of support. The Administrator shall act in accordance with this section when a filing window period for the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund Program, as described in paragraph a of this section, is in effect. When a filing period described in paragraph a of this section closes, the Administrator shall calculate the total demand for Telecommunications Program and Healthcare Connect Fund Program support submitted by all applicants during the filing window period. 1 Circumstances in which prioritization applies. If the total demand during the filing window period exceeds the total remaining support available for the funding year, prioritization will apply in the following circumstances 879 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 i Internal cap. If the internal cap is exceeded, the Administrator shall determine whether demand for upfront payments and the first year of multi-year commitments exceeds the internal cap. If such demand exceeds the internal cap, the Administrator shall not fund the second and third year of multi- year commitment requests and then apply the prioritization schedule in paragraph b2 of this section to all eligible requests for upfront payments and the first-year of multi-year commitments to limit the demand for upfront payments and the first year of multi-year commitments within the internal cap. If demand for upfront payments and the first year of multi-year commitments does not exceed the internal cap, the Administrator shall apply the prioritization schedule in paragraph b2 of this section to the second and third year of all eligible requests for multi-year commitments until the internal cap is reached, to ensure that the internal cap is not exceeded. ii Overall cap. If the internal cap is not exceeded or if, after demand for upfront payments and multi- year commitments is limited within the internal cap in paragraph b1i of this section, the total remaining demand still exceeds the total remaining support available for the funding year, the Administrator shall apply the prioritization schedule in paragraph b2 of this section to all remaining eligible funding requests. 2 Application of prioritization schedule. When prioritization is necessary under paragraph b1 of this section, the Administrator shall fully fund all applicable eligible requests falling under the first prioritization category of Table 1 before funding requests in the next lower prioritization category. The Administrator shall continue to process all applicable requests by prioritization category until there are no applicable funds remaining. If there is insufficient funding to fully fund all requests in a particular prioritization category, then the Administrator will pro-rate the applicable remaining funding among all applicable eligible requests in that prioritization category only pursuant to the proration process described in paragraph b3 of this section. TABLE 1 TO PARAGRAPH bPRIORITIZATION SCHEDULE Health Care Provider Site is Located in In a Medically Not in MUAP Underserved AreaPopulation MUAP Extremely Rural Tier areas entirely Priority 1 Priority 4 outside of a Core Based Statistical Area Rural Tier areas within a Core Based Priority 2 Priority 5 Statistical Area that does not have an urban area or urban cluster with a population equal to or greater than 25,000 Less Rural Tier areas within a Core Based Priority 3 Priority 6 Statistical Area with an urban area or urban cluster with a population equal to or greater than 25,000, but where the census tract does not contain any part of an urban area or urban cluster with population equal to or greater than 25,000 Non-Rural Tier all other non-rural areas Priority 7 Priority 8 3 Pro-rata reductions. When proration is necessary under paragraph b2 of this section, the Administrator shall take the following steps 880 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 i The Administrator shall divide the total applicable remaining funds available for the funding year by the applicable demand within the specific prioritization category to produce a pro-rata factor and ii The Administrator shall multiply the pro-rata factor by the dollar amount of each applicable funding request in the prioritization category to obtain prorated support for each funding request. 4 The Administrator shall designate the underlying contracts associated with any multi-year commitment requests that are not fully funded as a result of the prioritization process in this section as evergreen provided that those contracts meet the requirements under  54.622i3ii. 6. Amend  54.622a as follows  54.622 Competitive Bidding Requirements and Exemptions. a Competitive bidding requirement. All applicants are required to engage in a competitive bidding process for supported services, facilities, or equipment, as applicable, consistent with the requirements set forth in this section and any additional applicable state, Tribal, local, or other procurement requirements, unless they qualify for an exemption listed in paragraph i in this section. In addition, applicants may engage in competitive bidding even if they qualify for an exemption. Applicants who utilize a competitive bidding exemption may proceed directly to filing a funding request as described in  54.623. b    c    d    e    1    i The health care provider seeking supported services is a public or nonprofit entity that falls within one of the categories set forth in the definition of health care provider, listed in  54.600. 7. Amend  54.627 to delete subsections c1 and c2, renumber current subsection c3 as subsection c, and revise the new subsection c1D, all to read as follows  54.627 Invoicing Process and Certifications. a    1    b    c Telecommunications Program. 1 Certifications. Before the Administrator may process and pay an invoice, both the health care provider and the service provider must make the following certifications. i The health care provider must certify that A The service has been or is being provided to the health care provider B The universal service credit will be applied to the telecommunications service billing account of the health care provider or the billed entity as directed by the health care provider C It is authorized to submit this request on behalf of the health care provider D It has examined the invoice form and supporting documentation and that to the best of its 881 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 knowledge, information and belief, all statements of fact contained in the invoice form and supporting documentation are true E It or the consortium it represents satisfies all of the requirements and will abide by all of the relevant requirements, including all applicable Commission rules, with respect to universal service benefits provided under 47 U.S.C. 254 and F It understands that any letter from the Administrator that erroneously states that funds will be made available for the benefit of the applicant may be subject to rescission. ii The service provider must certify that A The information contained in the invoice is correct and the health care providers and the Billed Account Numbers have been credited with the amounts shown under Support Amount to be Paid by USAC B It has abided by all of the relevant requirements, including all applicable Commission rules C It has received and reviewed the invoice form and accompanying documentation, and that the rates charged for the telecommunications services, to the best of its knowledge, information and belief, are accurate and comply with the Commission's rules D It is authorized to submit the invoice E The health care provider paid the appropriate urban rate for the telecommunications services F The rural rate on the invoice does not exceed the appropriate rural rate G It has charged the health care provider for only eligible services prior to submitting the invoice for payment and accompanying documentation H It has not offered or provided a gift or any other thing of value to the applicant or to the applicant's personnel, including its consultant for which it will provide services and I The consultants or third parties it has hired do not have an ownership interest, sales commission arrangement, or other financial stake in the service provider chosen to provide the requested services, and that they have otherwise complied with Rural Health Care Program rules, including the Commission's rules requiring fair and open competitive bidding. J As a condition of receiving support, it will provide to the health care providers, on a timely basis, all documents regarding supported equipment or services that are necessary for the health care provider to submit required forms or respond to Commission or Administrator inquiries. d    882 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 APPENDIX B PROPOSED RULES For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the Federal Communications Commission proposes to amend 47 CFR part 54 to read as follows PART 54  UNIVERSAL SERVICE 1. Amend  54.601 to add a new paragraph c to read as follows  54.601 Health care provider eligibility.    c Conditional Approval of Eligibility. 1 An entity that is not a public or non-profit health care provider may request and receive a conditional approval of eligibility from the Administrator if the entity satisfies the following requirements i The entity is or will be physically located in a rural area defined in 54.600e of this subpart by an estimated eligibility date or, for the HCF Program only, is not located in a rural area but is or will be a member of a majority-rural Healthcare Connect Fund Program consortium that satisfies the eligible rural health care provider composition requirement set forth in 54.607b of this subpart by the estimated eligibility date ii The entity must provide documentation showing that it will qualify as a public or non-profit health care provider as defined in 54.600b of this subpart by the estimated eligibility date and iii The estimated eligibility date must be in the same funding year as or in the next funding year of the date that the entity requests the conditional approval of eligibility. 2 An entity that receives conditional approval of eligibility may conduct competitive bidding for the site. An entity engaging in competitive bidding with conditional approval of eligibility must provide a written notification to potential bidders that the entitys eligibility is conditional and specify the estimated eligibility date. 3 An entity that receives conditional approval of eligibility may file a request for funding for the site during an application filing window opened for a funding year that ends after the estimated eligibility date. The Administrator shall not issue any funding commitments to applicants that have received conditional approval of eligibility only. Funding commitments may be issued only after such applicants receive formal approval of eligibility as described in paragraph c4 of this section. 4 An entity that receives conditional approval of eligibility is expected to notify the Administrator, along with supporting documentation for the eligibility, within 30 days of its actual eligibility date. The actual eligibility date is the date that the entity qualifies as a public or non-profit health care provider as defined in 54.600b of this subpart and may be a different date from the estimated eligibility date. The Administrator shall formally approve the entitys eligibility if the entity meets the requirements for a public or non-profit health care provider defined in 54.600b of this subpart, provided that the entity still satisfies the requirement under paragraph c1i of this section. Upon the entity receiving a formal approval of eligibility, the Administrator may issue funding commitments covering a time period that starts no earlier than the entitys actual eligibility date and that is within the funding year for which support was requested. 2. Amend  54.604 by replacing paragraphs a  d to read as follows 883 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6  54.604. Determining the urban rate. a If a rural health care provider requests support for an eligible service to be funded from the Telecommunications Program the urban rate for that service shall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate charged to a commercial customer for a functionally similar service in any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that state, calculated as if it were provided between two points within the city. 3. Amend  54.605 by replacing paragraph a  c to read as follows  54.605. Determining the rural rate.      a The rural rate shall be used as described in this subpart to determine the credit or reimbursement due to a telecommunications carrier that provides eligible telecommunications services to eligible health care providers. 1 The rural rate shall be the median of publicly available rates charged by other service providers for the same or functionally similar services over the same distance in the rural area where the health care provider is located Method A. 2 If there are no publicly available rates charged by other service providers for the same or functionally similar services, the rural rate shall be the median of the rates that the carrier actually charges to non- health care provider commercial customers for the same or functionally similar services provided in the rural area where the health care provider is located Method B. 3 Cost-based rate. If the telecommunications carrier serving the health care provider is not providing any identical or similar services in the rural area or it reasonably determines that the rural rate calculated under sections a1 or 2 would not generate a reasonably compensatory rate, then the carrier shall submit to a state commission, for intrastate rates, or the Commission, for interstate rates, a cost-based rate for the provision of the service. i The carrier must provide to the state commission, for intrastate rates, or the Commission, for interstate rates, a justification of the proposed rural rate, which must include all financial data and other information to verify the service providers assertions, including at a minimum, the following information A Company-wide and rural health care service gross investment, accumulated depreciation, deferred state and federal income taxes, and net investment capital costs by category expressed as annual figures e.g., depreciation expense, state and federal income tax expense, return on net investment operating expenses by category e.g., maintenance expense, administrative and other overhead expenses, and tax expense other than income tax expense the applicable state and federal income tax rates fixed charges e.g., interest expense and any income tax adjustments B An explanation and a set of detailed spreadsheets showing the direct assignment of costs to the rural health care service and how company-wide common costs are allocated among the company's services, including the rural health care service, and the result of these direct assignments and allocations as necessary to develop a rate for the rural health care service C The company-wide and rural health care service costs for the most recent calendar year for which full-time actual, historical cost data are available 884 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 D Projections of the company-wide and rural health care service costs for the funding year in question and an explanation of those projections E Actual monthly demand data for the rural health care service for the most recent three calendar years if applicable F Projections of the monthly demand for the rural health care service for the funding year in question, and the data and details on the methodology used to make those projections G The annual revenue requirement capital costs and operating expenses expressed as an annual number plus a return on net investment and the rate for the funded service annual revenue requirement divided by annual demand divided by twelve equals the monthly rate for the service, assuming one rate element for the service, based on the projected rural health care service costs and demands H Audited financial statements and notes to the financial statements, if available, and otherwise unaudited financial statements for the most recent three fiscal years, specifically, the cash flow statement, income statement, and balance sheets. Such statements shall include information regarding costs and revenues associated with, or used as a starting point to develop, the rural health care service rate and I Density characteristics of the rural area or other relevant geographical areas including square miles, road miles, mountains, bodies of water, lack of roads, remoteness, challenges and costs associated with transporting fuel, satellite and backhaul availability, extreme weather conditions, challenging topography, short construction season or any other characteristics that contribute to the high cost of servicing the health care providers. 2 The carrier must provide such information periodically thereafter as required by the state commission, for intrastate rates, or the Commission, for interstate rates. In doing so, the carrier must take into account anticipated and actual demand for telecommunications services by all customers who will use the facilities over which services are being provided to eligible health care providers. b The rural rate shall not exceed the monthly rate in the service agreement that the health care provider enters into with the service provider when requesting funding. c Service providers engaged in multi-year or evergreen contracts are required to justify the rural rate only in the first year of the contract. 4. Amend  54.622e1i to read as follows  54.622 Competitive Bidding Requirements and Exemptions.    e    1    i The entity seeking supported services is a public or nonprofit health care provider that falls within one of the categories set forth in the definition of health care provider listed in  54.600, or will be such a public or nonprofit health care provider before the end of the funding year for which the supported services are requested provided that the entity is requesting or has received a conditional approval of eligibility pursuant to  54.601c of this subpart 885 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 5. Amend  54.625 by replacing paragraph c to read as follows  54.625 Service Provider Identification Number SPIN changes.      c Filing Deadline. An applicant must file its request for a corrective or operational SPIN change with the Administrator no later than the invoice filing deadline as defined by section 54.627. 886 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 APPENDIX C Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended RFA,1 the Commission included an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFA of the possible significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in the February 2022 Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Further Notice.2 The Commission sought written public comment on the proposals in the Further Notice including comment on the IRFA. The Commission did not receive any relevant comments in response to this IRFA. This Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis FRFA conforms to the RFA.3 A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Second Report and Order 2. Through this Second Report and Order, the Commission seeks to further improve the Rural Health Care RHC Programs capacity to distribute telecommunications and broadband support to health care providers especially small, rural healthcare providers HCPs  in the most equitable and efficient manner as possible. Over the years, telehealth has become an increasingly vital component of healthcare delivery to rural Americans. Rural healthcare facilities are typically limited by the equipment and supplies they have and the scope of services they can offer which ultimately can have an impact on the availability of high-quality health care. Therefore, the RHC Program plays a critical role in overcoming some of the obstacles healthcare providers face in healthcare delivery in rural communities. Considering the significance of RHC Program support, the Commission implements several measures to most effectively meet HCPs needs while responsibly distributing the RHC Programs limited funds. 3. In the Second Report and Order, we adopt proposals from the February 2022 Further Notice to amend RHC Program administrative processes and internal cap application and prioritization rules to promote efficiency, reduce delays in funding commitments, and prioritize support for the current funding year as well as make a minor technical change to the text of our rules.4 B. Summary of Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments in Response to the IRFA 4. There were no comments filed that specifically address the rules and policies proposed in the IRFA. C. Response to Comments by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration 5. Pursuant to the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010,5 which amended the RFA, the Commission is required to respond to any comments filed by the Chief Counsel of the Small Business Administration SBA, and to provide a detailed statement of any change made to the proposed rules as a result of those comments.6 The Chief Counsel did not file any comments in response to the proposed rules in this proceeding. 1 5 U.S.C.  603. The RFA, 5 U.S.C.  601 - 612, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 SBREFA, Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 1996. 2 See Further Notice, WC Docket No. 17-310, Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 22-15 2022 Further Notice. 3 See 5 U.S.C.  604. 4 See Further Notice at paras 64-76. 5 5 U.S.C.  604a3. 6 Id. 887 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 D. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rules Will Apply 6. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.7 The RFA generally defines the term small entity as having the same meaning as the terms small business, small organization, and small governmental jurisdiction.8 In addition, the term small business has the same meaning as the term small business concern under the Small Business Act.9 A small business concern is one that 1 is independently owned and operated 2 is not dominant in its field of operation and 3 satisfies any additional criteria established by the Small Business Administration SBA.10 7. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions. Our actions, over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present. We therefore describe here, at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.11 First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, according to data from the SBAs Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.12 These types of small businesses represent 99.9 percent of all businesses in the United States which translates to 31.7 million businesses.13 8. Next, the type of small entity described as a small organization is generally any not- for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.14 The Internal Revenue Service IRS uses a revenue benchmark of 50,000 or less to delineate its annual electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.15 Nationwide, for tax year 2018, there were approximately 571,709 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of 50,000 or less according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.16 7 5 U.S.C.  603b3. 8 5 U.S.C.  6016. 9 5 U.S.C.  6013 incorporating by reference the definition of small business concern in 15 U.S.C.  632. Pursuant to the RFA, the statutory definition of a small business applies unless an agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definitions in the Federal Register. 5 U.S.C.  6013. 10 See 15 U.S.C.  632. 11 See 5 U.S.C.  6013-6. 12 See U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy, Whats New With Small Business?

Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small organizations in this small entity description. See IRS, Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt Organizations  Form 990-N e-Postcard, Who May File Form 990-N to Satisfy Their Annual Reporting Requirement, httpswww.irs.govcharities-non-profitsannual-electronic-filing-requirement-for-small-exempt- organizations-form-990-n-e-postcard last visited Jan. 26, 2023. We note that the IRS data does not provide information on whether a small exempt organization is independently owned and operated or dominant in its field. 16 See Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract EO BMF, CSV Files by Region, httpswww.irs.govcharities-non-profitsexempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf.

Finally, the small entity described as a small governmental jurisdiction is defined generally as governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.17 U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census of Governments18 indicates that there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.19 Of this number there were 39, 931 general purpose governments county20, municipal and town or township21 with populations of less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments independent school districts22 with populations of less than 50,000.23 Based on the 2017 U.S. Census Bureau data we estimate that at least 48, 971 entities fall in the category of small governmental jurisdictions.24 10. Small entities potentially affected by the proposals herein include eligible rural non-profit and public health care providers and the eligible service providers offering them services, including telecommunications service providers, Internet Service Providers ISPs, and vendors of the services and equipment used for dedicated broadband networks.25 Continued from previous page BMF data for Region 1-Northeast Area 76,886, Region 2-Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes Areas 221,121, and Region 3-Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast Areas 273,702 which includes the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii.

Special-Purpose Local Governments by State Census Years 1942 to 2017 CG1700ORG04, CG1700ORG04 Table Notes Special Purpose Local Governments by State Census Years 1942 to 2017. 23 This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments county, municipal and town or township with populations of less than 50,000 36,931 and the number of special purpose governments - independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 12,040, from the 2017 Census of Governments - Organizations Tables 5, 6, and 10. While the special purpose governments category also includes local special district governments, the 2017 Census of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on population size for the special purpose governments category. Therefore, only data from independent school districts is included in the special purpose governments category. 24 Id. 25 47 CFR  54.601, 54.621. 889 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 1.

Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite. This industry comprises establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide communications via the airwaves. Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and wireless video services.143 The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.144 For this industry, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 967 firms that operated for the entire year.145 Of this total, 955 firms employed fewer than 1,000 employees and 12 firms employed of 1000 employees or more.146 Thus under this category and the associated size standard, the Commission estimates that the majority of Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite are small entities. 40.

The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of firms that meet the SBA size standard. 147 See Federal Communications Commission, Universal Licensing System, httpwireless.fcc.govuls. For the purposes of this FRFA, consistent with Commission practice for wireless services, the Commission estimates the number of licensees based on the number of unique FCC Registration Numbers. 148 See Federal Communications Commission, Wireline Competition Bureau, Industry Analysis and Technology Division, Trends in Telephone Service at Table 5.3 Sept. 2010 Trends in Telephone Service, httpsapps.fcc.govedocs_publicattachmatchDOC-301823A1.pdf. 902 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 than 1,500 employees.149 Thus, using available data, we estimate that the majority of wireless firms can be considered small. 41. Wireless Telephony. Wireless telephony includes cellular, personal communications services, and specialized mobile radio telephony carriers. The closest applicable SBA category is Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite.150 Under the SBA small business size standard, a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.151 For this industry, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 967 firms that operated for the entire year.152 Of this total, 955 firms had fewer than 1,000 employees and 12 firms had 1000 employees or more.153 Thus under this category and the associated size standard, the Commission estimates that a majority of these entities can be considered small. According to Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in wireless telephony.154 Of these, an estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 152 have more than 1,500 employees.155 Therefore, more than half of these entities can be considered small. 42. Satellite Telecommunications. This category comprises firms primarily engaged in providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or reselling satellite telecommunications.156 Satellite telecommunications service providers include satellite and earth station operators. The category has a small business size standard of 35 million or less in average annual receipts, under SBA rules.157 For this category, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were a total of 333 firms that operated for the entire year.158 Of this total, 299 firms had annual receipts of less than 25 million.159 Consequently, we estimate that the majority of satellite telecommunications providers are small entities. 43. All Other Telecommunications. The All Other Telecommunications category is comprised of establishments primarily engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services, 149 See id. 150 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517312 Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517312year2017details517312. 151 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517312 previously 517210. 152 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census of the United States, Table ID EC1251SSSZ5, Information Subject Series Estab and Firm Size Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2012, NAICS Code 517210, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?textEC1251SSSZ5n517210tidECNSIZE2012.EC1251SSSZ5hidePrev iewfalsevintage2012. 153 Id.

Internet Service Providers 44. Internet Service Providers Broadband. Broadband Internet service providers include wired e.g., cable, DSL and VoIP service providers using their own operated wired telecommunications infrastructure fall in the category of Wired Telecommunication Carriers.166 Wired Telecommunications Carriers are comprised of establishments primarily engaged in operating andor providing access to transmission facilities and infrastructure that they own andor lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using wired telecommunications networks. Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a combination of technologies.167 The SBA size standard for this category classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.168 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 3,117 firms that operated that year.169 Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.170 Consequently, under this size standard the majority of firms in this industry can be considered small. 160 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517919 All Other Telecommunications, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517919year2017details517919. 161 Id. 162Id. 163 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517919. 164 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census of the United States, Table ID EC1251SSSZ4, Information Subject Series - Estab and Firm Size Receipts Size of Firms for the U.S. 2012, NAICS Code 517919, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?textEC1251SSSZ4n517919tidECNSIZE2012.EC1251SSSZ4hidePrev iewfalse. 165 Id.

Internet Service Providers Non-Broadband. Internet access service providers such as Dial-up Internet service providers, VoIP service providers using client-supplied telecommunications connections and Internet service providers using client-supplied telecommunications connections e.g., dial-up ISPs fall in the category of All Other Telecommunications.171 The SBA has developed a small business size standard for All Other Telecommunications which consists of all such firms with gross annual receipts of 35 million or less.172 For this category, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 1,442 firms that operated for the entire year.173 Of these firms, a total of 1,400 had gross annual receipts of less than 25 million.174 Consequently, under this size standard a majority of firms in this industry can be considered small. c. Vendors and Equipment Manufacturers 46. Vendors of Infrastructure Development or Network Buildout. The Commission has not developed a small business size standard specifically directed toward manufacturers of network facilities. There are two applicable SBA categories in which manufacturers of network facilities could fall and each have different size standards under the SBA rules. The SBA categories are Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment with a size standard of 1,250 employees or less175 and Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing with a size standard of 750 employees or less.176 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 shows that for Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment firms 841 establishments operated for the entire year.177 Of that number, 828 establishments operated with fewer than 1,000 employees, and 7 establishments operated with between 1,000 and 2,499 employees.178 For Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012, show that 383 establishments operated for 171 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517919 All Other Telecommunications, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517919year2017details517919. 172 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517919. 173 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census of the United States, Table ID EC1251SSSZ4, Information Subject Series - Estab and Firm Size Receipts Size of Firms for the U.S. 2012, NAICS Code 517919, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?textEC1251SSSZ4n517919tidECNSIZE2012.EC1251SSSZ4hidePrev iewfalse. 174 Id.

The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of establishments that meet the SBA size standard of employment of 1,250 or fewer employees. The number of establishments is a less helpful indicator of small business prevalence in this context than would be the number of firms or companies. An establishment is a single physical location at which business is conducted andor services are provided. It is not necessarily identical with a single firm, company or enterprise, which may consist of one or more establishments. Thus, the numbers given may reflect inflated numbers of businesses in this category, including the number of small businesses.

Telephone Apparatus Manufacturing. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing wire telephone and data communications equipment.181 These products may be stand-alone or board-level components of a larger system. Examples of products made by these establishments are central office switching equipment, cordless and wire telephones except cellular, PBX equipment, telephone answering machines, LAN modems, multi-user modems, and other data communications equipment, such as bridges, routers, and gateways.182 The SBA has developed a small business size standard for Telephone Apparatus Manufacturing, which consists of all such companies having 1,250 or fewer employees.183 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 266 establishments that operated that year.184 Of this total, 262 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.185 Thus, under this size standard, the majority of firms in this industry can be considered small. 48. Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing.

E. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements for Small Entities 50. The rules adopted in the Second Report and Order will not result in modified reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small or large entities. F. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and Significant Alternatives Considered 51. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business, alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives among others 1 the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities 2 the clarification, 187 Id. 188 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 334220. 189 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census of the United States, Table ID EC1231SG2, Manufacturing Summary Series General Summary Industry Statistics for Subsectors and Industries by Employment Size 2012, NAICS Code 334220, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?textEC1231SG2n334220tidECNSIZE2012.EC1231SG2hidePreview false. 190 Id.

In this Second Report and Order, we take steps to minimize the economic impact on small entities with the rule changes that we have adopted. We amend our invoicing process to harmonize the process across the Telecom Program and the HCF Program. We minimize the impact of this change on small entities by ensuring that there is a mechanism to allow multiple invoices to be filed in a single submission. We also amend our funding cap and prioritization rules to limit the application of the internal cap and prioritize health care providers current year financial need over their future year need when the internal cap is exceeded. This change will help small entities by reducing the instances in which the internal cap applies and prioritizing funding for the current funding year when it does. These actions will promote efficiency, reduce delays in funding commitments, and minimize the possibility that some health care providers may not receive their current years support in the event of prioritization to upfront payment and multi-year commitment requests, while strengthening protections against waste, fraud and abuse. G. Report to Congress 53. The Commission will send a copy of the Second Report and Order, including this FRFA, in a report to be sent to Congress and the Government Accountability Office pursuant to the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996.197 In addition, the Commission will send a copy of the Second Report and Order, including the FRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. A copy of the Second Report and Order and FRFA or summaries thereof will also be published in the Federal Register. 196 5 U.S.C.  603c1 - 4. 197 5 U.S.C.  801a1A. 908 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 APPENDIX D Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended RFA,1 the Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFA of the possible significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in the Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Second Further Notice. Written public comments are requested on this IRFA. Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for comments on the Second Further Notice provided on the first page of the item. The Commission will send a copy of the Second Further Notice, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration SBA.2 In addition, the Second Further Notice and IRFA or summaries thereof will be published in the Federal Register.3 A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules 2. Through this Second Further Notice, the Commission seeks to further improve the Rural Health Care RHC Programs capacity to distribute telecommunications and broadband support to health care providers especially small, rural healthcare providers HCPs  in the most equitable and efficient manner as possible. Over the years, telehealth has become an increasingly vital component of healthcare delivery to rural Americans. Rural healthcare facilities are typically limited by the equipment and supplies they have and the scope of services they can offer which ultimately can have an impact on the availability of high-quality health care. Therefore, the RHC Program plays a critical role in overcoming some of the obstacles healthcare providers face in healthcare delivery in rural communities. Considering the significance of RHC Program support, the Commission proposes and seeks comment on several measures to most effectively meet HCPs needs while responsibly distributing the RHC Programs limited funds. 3. In this Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we seek comment on proposed revisions to rate determination rules, the cap on support for satellite services, and revisions to data collected in the Telecom Program. We also propose changes to allow health care providers to receive funding shortly after they become eligible, allow participants with multi-year and evergreen contracts to only justify rural rates in the first year of the contract, and propose changes to administrative deadlines such as changes to amend program rules to align the deadline for filing a Service Provider Identification Number SPIN change with the invoice deadline. B. Legal Basis 4. The legal basis for the Second Further Notice is contained in sections 1 through 4gDi-j, 201-205, 254, 303I, and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C.  151 through 154i, j, 201 through 205, 254, 303r, and 403. C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed Rules Will Apply 5. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.4 The RFA generally defines the term small entity as having the same meaning as the terms small business, small 1 5 U.S.C.  603. The RFA, 5 U.S.C.  601612, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 SBREFA, Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 1996. 2 See 5 U.S.C.  603a. 3 See id. 4 5 U.S.C.  603b3. 909 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 organization, and small governmental jurisdiction.5 In addition, the term small business has the same meaning as the term small business concern under the Small Business Act.6 A small business concern is one that 1 is independently owned and operated 2 is not dominant in its field of operation and 3 satisfies any additional criteria established by the Small Business Administration SBA.7 6. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions. Our actions, over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present. We therefore describe here, at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.8 First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, according to data from the SBAs Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.9 These types of small businesses represent 99.9 percent of all businesses in the United States which translates to 31.7 million businesses.10 7. Next, the type of small entity described as a small organization is generally any not- for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.11 The Internal Revenue Service IRS uses a revenue benchmark of 50,000 or less to delineate its annual electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.12 Nationwide, for tax year 2018, there were approximately 571,709 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of 50,000 or less according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.13 8. Finally, the small entity described as a small governmental jurisdiction is defined generally as governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special 5 5 U.S.C.  6016. 6 5 U.S.C.  6013 incorporating by reference the definition of small business concern in 15 U.S.C.  632. Pursuant to the RFA, the statutory definition of a small business applies unless an agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definitions in the Federal Register. 5 U.S.C.  6013. 7 See 15 U.S.C.  632. 8 See 5 U.S.C.  6013-6. 9 See U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy, Whats New With Small Business?

Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small organizations in this small entity description. See IRS, Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt Organizations  Form 990-N e-Postcard, Who May File Form 990-N to Satisfy Their Annual Reporting Requirement, httpswww.irs.govcharities-non-profitsannual-electronic-filing-requirement-for-small-exempt- organizations-form-990-n-e-postcard last visited Jan. 26, 2023.

Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite. This industry comprises establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide communications via the airwaves. Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and wireless video services.140 The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.141 For this industry, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 967 firms that operated for the entire year.142 Of this total, 955 firms employed fewer than 1,000 employees and 12 firms employed of 1000 employees or more.143 Thus under this category and the associated size standard, the Commission estimates that the majority of Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite are small entities. 39.

For the purposes of this FRFA, consistent with Commission practice for wireless services, the Commission estimates the number of licensees based on the number of unique FCC Registration Numbers. 145 See Federal Communications Commission, Wireline Competition Bureau, Industry Analysis and Technology Division, Trends in Telephone Service at Table 5.3 Sept. 2010 Trends in Telephone Service, httpsapps.fcc.govedocs_publicattachmatchDOC-301823A1.pdf. 924 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 than 1,500 employees.146 Thus, using available data, we estimate that the majority of wireless firms can be considered small. 40. Wireless Telephony. Wireless telephony includes cellular, personal communications services, and specialized mobile radio telephony carriers. The closest applicable SBA category is Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite.147 Under the SBA small business size standard, a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.148 For this industry, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 967 firms that operated for the entire year.149 Of this total, 955 firms had fewer than 1,000 employees and 12 firms had 1000 employees or more.150 Thus under this category and the associated size standard, the Commission estimates that a majority of these entities can be considered small. According to Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in wireless telephony.151 Of these, an estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 152 have more than 1,500 employees.152 Therefore, more than half of these entities can be considered small. 41. Satellite Telecommunications. This category comprises firms primarily engaged in providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or reselling satellite telecommunications.153 Satellite telecommunications service providers include satellite and earth station operators. The category has a small business size standard of 35 million or less in average annual receipts, under SBA rules.154 For this category, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were a total of 333 firms that operated for the entire year.155 Of this total, 299 firms had annual receipts of less than 25 million.156 Consequently, we estimate that the majority of satellite telecommunications providers are small entities. 42. All Other Telecommunications. The All Other Telecommunications category is comprised of establishments primarily engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services, 146 See id. 147 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517312 Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517312year2017details517312. 148 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517312 previously 517210. 149 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census of the United States, Table ID EC1251SSSZ5, Information Subject Series Estab and Firm Size Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2012, NAICS Code 517210, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?textEC1251SSSZ5n517210tidECNSIZE2012.EC1251SSSZ5hidePrev iewfalsevintage2012. 150 Id.

Internet Service Providers 43. Internet Service Providers Broadband. Broadband Internet service providers include wired e.g., cable, DSL and VoIP service providers using their own operated wired telecommunications infrastructure fall in the category of Wired Telecommunication Carriers.163 Wired Telecommunications Carriers are comprised of establishments primarily engaged in operating andor providing access to transmission facilities and infrastructure that they own andor lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using wired telecommunications networks. Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a combination of technologies.164 The SBA size standard for this category classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.165 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 3,117 firms that operated that year.166 Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.167 Consequently, under this size standard the majority of firms in this industry can be considered small. 157 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517919 All Other Telecommunications, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517919year2017details517919. 158 Id. 159 Id. 160 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517919. 161 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census of the United States, Table ID EC1251SSSZ4, Information Subject Series - Estab and Firm Size Receipts Size of Firms for the U.S. 2012, NAICS Code 517919, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?textEC1251SSSZ4n517919tidECNSIZE2012.EC1251SSSZ4hidePrev iewfalse. 162 Id.

Internet Service Providers Non-Broadband. Internet access service providers such as Dial-up Internet service providers, VoIP service providers using client-supplied telecommunications connections and Internet service providers using client-supplied telecommunications connections e.g., dial-up ISPs fall in the category of All Other Telecommunications.168 The SBA has developed a small business size standard for All Other Telecommunications which consists of all such firms with gross annual receipts of 35 million or less.169 For this category, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 1,442 firms that operated for the entire year.170 Of these firms, a total of 1,400 had gross annual receipts of less than 25 million.171 Consequently, under this size standard a majority of firms in this industry can be considered small. c. Vendors and Equipment Manufacturers 45. Vendors of Infrastructure Development or Network Buildout. The Commission has not developed a small business size standard specifically directed toward manufacturers of network facilities. There are two applicable SBA categories in which manufacturers of network facilities could fall and each have different size standards under the SBA rules. The SBA categories are Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment with a size standard of 1,250 employees or less172 and Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing with a size standard of 750 employees or less.173 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 shows that for Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment firms 841 establishments operated for the entire year.174 Of that number, 828 establishments operated with fewer than 1,000 employees, and 7 establishments operated with between 1,000 and 2,499 employees.175 For Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012, show that 383 establishments operated for 168 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517919 All Other Telecommunications, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517919year2017details517919. 169 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517919. 170 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census of the United States, Table ID EC1251SSSZ4, Information Subject Series - Estab and Firm Size Receipts Size of Firms for the U.S. 2012, NAICS Code 517919, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?textEC1251SSSZ4n517919tidECNSIZE2012.EC1251SSSZ4hidePrev iewfalse. 171 Id.

The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of establishments that meet the SBA size standard of employment of 1,250 or fewer employees. The number of establishments is a less helpful indicator of small business prevalence in this context than would be the number of firms or companies. An establishment is a single physical location at which business is conducted andor services are provided. It is not necessarily identical with a single firm, company or enterprise, which may consist of one or more establishments. Thus, the numbers given may reflect inflated numbers of businesses in this category, including the number of small businesses.

Telephone Apparatus Manufacturing. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing wire telephone and data communications equipment.178 These products may be stand-alone or board-level components of a larger system. Examples of products made by these establishments are central office switching equipment, cordless and wire telephones except cellular, PBX equipment, telephone answering machines, LAN modems, multi-user modems, and other data communications equipment, such as bridges, routers, and gateways.179 The SBA has developed a small business size standard for Telephone Apparatus Manufacturing, which consists of all such companies having 1,250 or fewer employees.180 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 266 establishments that operated that year.181 Of this total, 262 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.182 Thus, under this size standard, the majority of firms in this industry can be considered small. 47. Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing radio and television broadcast and wireless communications equipment.183 Examples of products made by these establishments are transmitting and receiving antennas, cable television equipment, GPS equipment, 176 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census of the United States, Table ID EC1231SG2, Manufacturing Summary Series General Summary Industry Statistics for Subsectors and Industries by Employment Size 2012, NAICS Code 334290, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?tidECNSIZE2012.EC1231SG2y2012n334290vintage2012hidePre viewfalse. 177 Id.

Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing communications equipment except telephone apparatus, and radio and television broadcast, and wireless communications equipment.188 Examples of such manufacturing include fire detection and alarm systems manufacturing, Intercom systems and equipment manufacturing, and signals e.g., highway, pedestrian, railway, traffic manufacturing.189 The SBA has established a size standard for this industry as all such firms having 750 or fewer employees.190 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 shows that 383 establishments operated in that year.191 Of that number, 379 operated with fewer than 500 employees and 4 had 500 to 999 employees.192 Based on this data, we conclude that the majority of Other Communications Equipment Manufacturers are small. D. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and Significant Alternatives Considered 49. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business, alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives among others 1 the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities 2 the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for such small entities 3 the use of performance rather than design standards and 4 an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities. We expect to consider all of these factors when we have received substantive comment from the public and potentially affected entities. 184 Id. 185 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 334220. 186 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Economic Census of the United States, Table ID EC1231SG2, Manufacturing Summary Series General Summary Industry Statistics for Subsectors and Industries by Employment Size 2012, NAICS Code 334220, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?textEC1231SG2n334220tidECNSIZE2012.EC1231SG2hidePreview false. 187 Id.

Largely, the proposals in this Second Further Notice if adopted would have no impact on or would reduce the economic impact of current regulations on small entities. Certain proposals could have a positive economic impact on small entities. In the instances in which a proposed change would increase the financial burden on small entities, we have determined that the net financial and other benefits from such changes would outweigh the increased burdens on small entities. 51. Determining Accurate Rates in the Telecom Program. We propose modifications to the three rural rate determination methods in the Telecom Program, including changes to the market-based approach of Methods 1 and 2 and new evidentiary requirements for justifying cost-based rates under Method 3. We also propose that participants with multi-year contracts and evergreen contracts would only have to justify rural rates in the first year of the contract. We also propose to simplify the calculation of urban rate rules by eliminating the standard urban distance requirement and seek specific comment on sources of urban rates as well as general comment on our urban rate rules. We propose to keep the cap on support for satellite services reinstated and seek comment on potential changes to it. Lastly, we seek comment on proposed revisions to FCC Form 466 intended to improve the quality of Telecom Program data. 52. Administrative Deadlines. We also propose to amend program rules align the deadline for filing a SPIN change with the invoice deadline. If implemented, this proposal would have a positive impact on small health care providers because it would reduce the need for them to seek waivers of the current SPIN change deadline. We also seek comment on whether a mechanism to allow post- commitment changes to evergreen contract dates is necessary. 53. Future Eligibility. We also propose a mechanism whereby entities that are not yet eligible health care providers can engage in competitive bidding and file requests for funding, which would allow them to receive RHC Program funding shortly after they become eligible. If implemented, this proposal would have a positive economic impact on small health care providers because it would allow them to receive RHC Program funding shortly after they become eligible. E.

What do we bring with us beyond the pandemic? It is a question we are asking in every sector of the economy, in every corner of this country. Our experience with this virus has transformed so much. It has changed where we live, how we work, and what we value in our lives. It also has deepened our dependence on communications. You see this across the board, but especially in healthcare. Thats because telemedicine has moved into the mainstream. Getting an appointment online, checking in with your provider, and having a practitioner diagnose at a distance are all now more common than ever beforeand we have embraced the power of telehealth like never before. This technology, however, is not all new. For more than a quarter of a century, the Federal Communications Commission has been supporting telemedicine. Our groundbreaking Rural Health Care programs have long been a force for good, bringing affordable care to some of the most remote areas of the country by using communications technology to connect patient and provider. The oldest part of our Rural Health Care Program is known as the Telecom Program. It offers support to rural healthcare providers for the difference between the rates they are charged for communications and those they would pay for the same facilities in urban areas. This program has been a quiet dynamo, helping some of the furthest-flung places in this country stay connected to first class care. I know, I have seen it in action in some of the most isolated communities in Alaska and Montana. This program is a lifesaver. But a few years ago, here in Washington, this agency got ahead of itself. It tried to fix the Telecom Program by setting up a series of databases designed to tell communities exactly what communications services should cost. But this fix was littered with anomalies. For instance, in Alaska the database featured a rate for a dedicated transmission service in the Extremely Rural tier that was lower than the rate for the same service in the Less Rural tier. In California, the database showed that a 50 Mbps connection was cheaper than a 20 Mbps connection. Rural healthcare authorities, the providers serving them, and members of Congress spoke up. They pointed out what should have been obvious this database had serious flaws. More than that, they noted that using it could lead to real problems sustaining connections essential for healthcare in some of the most remote locations in the United States. So for the last two years the Commission has waived the use of this database. Today, we fix it for good. In fact, we bid it goodbye and return to the earlier system that worked for providers and helped grow this telemedicine program into what it is today. We also continue to allow participants to use already-approved rates for an additional two funding years, to ensure smooth operation of the program. Finally, we take steps to simplify our invoicing rules and reduce funding delays and we ask questions about how to improve the program going forward. This is good news. The Rural Health Care Program is one of the great gems of this agency. It was early to demonstrate the power of telemedicine and its value in rural communities. And now those communities are no longer outliers when it comes to telehealth technologies. Because the pandemic has demonstrated just how vital they are for everyone, everywhere.

Bethel, Alaska sits along the banks of the slow-moving Kuskokwim Riverabout 40 meandering miles upstream from the Bering Sea and 400 air miles west of Anchorage. The town of about 6,000 people is completely cut off from the road system. You can get there by air, by sea, or in the winter, if youre brave enough, by ice road. Last summer, both Commissioner Simington and I had the chance to spend time in Bethel on a visit led by Senator Sullivan. Thats where we met with the health care providers at the Yukon- Kuskokwim Delta Regional Hospital. Its a 50-bed hospital that provides critical care to individuals in Bethel and other remote communities that are spread across a geographic area the size of Oregon. The hospital houses the only emergency room in the region and, for many, it is the only source of trauma care and surgical services. Much like other facilities in Alaska, the hospitals connections and telehealth services are supported by the FCCs Rural Health Care Program. With respect to closing the digital divide in Alaska, I dont think the FCC has always gotten it right when it comes to our statutory obligations. We have been working hard to correct course, though. Todays decision is another good step in the right direction. I want to thank my colleagues for working with my office to improve todays item both for the providers in Alaska and for those across the country. There is more work to be done, and I am committed to working with all stakeholders to get this program right over the long term. In closing, I want to recognize the staff and leadership of the Wireline Competition Bureau for their hard work on this item. You have my thanks, and the item has my support. 934 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6 STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER GEOFFREY STARKS Re Promoting Telehealth in Rural America, Order on Reconsideration, Second Report and Order, Order, and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, WC Docket No. 17-310 January 26, 2023. We are currently in the midst of a winter season that has seen many, including children, battling what some public health experts have termed a tripledemicCOVID, RSV, and a resurgent flu. I cant think of a better time, then, for the Commission to update, and improve, our Rural Health Care Program. Telehealth continues to save and improve lives for those in rural America relying on broadband for their next doctors appointment. Growing up in a family of doctors, who serve many patients that live in rural America, Ive seen and heard how important it is to ensure that rural health care providers have the same connectivity as their urban counterparts. This Program is doing that hard work. This item has its roots in an Order the Commission adopted in 2019. At that time, I joined then- Commissioner Rosenworcel in dissenting from the majoritys plan to adopt a new method to determine support for the Telecommunications Program, often called the Rates Database. 1 I was worried that the Rates Database could negatively impact program participants and that further study was needed before we should take action.2 Unfortunately, almost immediately, my fears were realized and the Commission began issuing waivers due to significant anomalies that arose in the initial median urban and rural rate calculations in the Rates Database. The item we adopt today will provide Rural Health Care Program participants with much-needed clarity and certainty going forward. We return the Telecom Program to the rate determination rules that existed prior to the 2019 Order. We eliminate the need to rely on waivers and make additional changes to improve the Rural Health Care Program rules to increase efficiency and reduce delay. At the same time, we take this opportunity to improve, in a thoughtful manner, the rate determination rules. Importantly, in proposing to update the rules going forward in todays Further Notice, we propose and seek comment on two new methods to determining rural rates. We propose rational methods that should make the process simpler while also protecting the Universal Service Fund from waste, fraud, and abuse. These proposals should make it easier for eligible health care providers to receive support as soon as they become eligible. But, in proposing these changes in the Further Notice, we give those who serve some of the most remote health care providers an opportunity to weigh in and help inform our rulemaking. I hope they do so. Last, in 2019, and 2022, I repeatedly called for the Commission to collect and use the best data available to analyze proposals as we consider changes to our rules and programs. Im glad that in this item we seek comment on how to revise FCC Form 466 to improve the data we collect. As we consider additional changes to the Rural Health Care Program, we must ensure that our efforts mitigate and eliminate unintended consequences. To that end, Im glad that commenters have already favorably weighed in to support collecting more detailed data. Only through a methodical and deliberative process with roots in accurate data can we ensure that the spirit and goals of the Rural Health Care Program are achieved. I thank the Chairwoman for her leadership and strongly support this item. My thanks to the dedicated FCC staff for their fantastic work. 1 Promoting Telehealth in Rural America, WC Docket No. 17-310, Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd 7335, Statement of Commissioner Geoffrey Starks Approving in Part, Dissenting in Part 2019. 2 Id. 935 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 Before the Federal Communications Commission Washington, D.C. 20554 In the Matter of   Ensuring the Reliability and Resiliency of the 988  PS Docket No. 23-5 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline   Amendments to Part 4 of the Commissions Rules  PS Docket No. 15-80 Concerning Disruptions to Communications   Implementation of the National Suicide Hotline  WC Docket No. 18-336 Improvement Act of 2018  NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING Adopted January 26, 2023 Released January 27, 2023 Comment Date 30 days after date of publication in the Federal Register Reply Comment Date 60 days after date of publication in the Federal Register By the Commission Chairwoman Rosenworcel and Commissioner Starks issuing separate statements.

INTRODUCTION 1. The 988 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline 988 Lifeline is a national network of more than 200 crisis centers that helps thousands of people overcome crisis situations every day. Dialing 9-8-8 serves as a crucial lifeline for people in need of immediate help. The ability to call 988 and reach help on a timely, consistent basis is of utmost importance to provide support and care to those who may be experiencing a suicidal crisis or mental health-related distress. On December 1, 2022, however, the 988 Lifeline suffered a nationwide outage that lasted several hours, rendering this vital service inaccessible to voice callers.1 The Department of Health and Human Services announced the outage on Twitter, indicating they were tracking a widespread national system outage at Intrado, a contractor for crisis providers that supports emergency response needs across the country, including the 988 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline.2 The outage left callers reliant on alternative means to contact the hotline, such as text or webchat hosted at 988lifeline.org, to which the public were directed by the Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration SAMHSA3 once it was made aware of the outage.4 2. To address this serious issue, in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we propose rules designed to ensure that the Federal Communications Commission Commission and those parties that provide life-saving crisis intervention services to people calling the 988 Lifeline, which includes the Veterans Crisis Lifeline, receive timely and actionable information about 988 service outages that potentially affect those services ability to meet the immediate health needs of people in suicidal crisis and mental health distress. II. BACKGROUND 3. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, the suicide rate in this country increased by 35 from 1999 to 2018.5 In 2020, suicide was a leading cause of death in the United States for people aged 10 to 64 and the second leading cause of death among young people aged 10 to 24.6 Suicide claimed the lives of nearly 46,000 Americans in 2020, resulting in about one death 1 See, e.g., Associated Press, Widespread outage shuts down 988 mental health hotline, Dec. 1, 2022, httpsapnews.comarticlehealth-mental-service-outages-government-and-politics- d39ecadd27541c7c37c71caff95f975e Those trying to reach the line for help with suicide, depression, or other mental health crises were greeted with a message that said the line is experiencing a service outage. 2 Sarah Lovenheim HHS-Spox, Twitter Dec. 1, 2022, 202 PM, httpstwitter.comHHS Spoxstatus1598392052903026689?ref srctwsrc5Etfw7Ctwcamp5Etweetembed 7Ctwterm5E15983920565100298247Ctwgr5E9fd47fdbff186683a34e9b324826c395adb0af677Ctwcon5E s2 ref urlhttps3A2F2Fwww.washingtonexaminer.com2Fnews2F988-mental-health-hotline-shuts- down-amid-widespread-outage. 3 The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration SAMHSA is the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services responsible for overseeing the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. 4 See Amanda Seitz, Associated Press, National 911 mental health hotline back up after outage, Dec. 2, 2022, httpsapnews.comarticlehealth-business-mental-government-and-politics-f94c8b5d5bc74e7df254bb5e846bf3a1. 5 Holly Hedegaard, Sally C.

For every one person who dies by suicide annually, 316 people seriously consider suicide.8 4. Suicide also disproportionately impacts various at-risk populations. In 2020, there were 6,146 Veteran suicides  an average of 16.8 per day  and adjusting for population age and sex differences, the suicide rate for Veterans was 57.3 greater than for non-veteran U.S. adults.9 LGBTQ youth are four times more likely to seriously consider suicide, to make a plan for suicide, and to attempt suicide versus their peers.10 A large proportion of youths ages 13-24 have attempted suicide, with the proportion particularly high among NativeIndigenous youths or youths who are members of certain minorities. Twelve percent of white youth attempted suicide compared to 31 of NativeIndigenous youth, 21 of Black youth, 21 of multiracial youth, 18 of Latinx youth, and 12 of AsianPacific Islander youth.11 The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has found that suicide rates in 10-19 year old Black males has increased by 60 over the past two decades.12 Suicide rates are also higher among Native Americans as well as rural Americans. According to the CDC, American IndiansAlaska Natives have the highest rates of suicide of any racial or ethnic group in the United States, and the rates of suicide among this population have been increasing since 2003.13 And in 2017, the suicide rate for the most rural counties in the country was nearly double the rate for the most urban counties.14 Recent research also highlights that adults with disabilities are more likely to consider suicide. For example, a 2021 survey found that adults with disabilities are three times more likely to report suicidal ideation in the past month compared to persons without disabilities.15 A 2020 study showed that 7 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Preventing Suicide Fact Sheet, httpswww.cdc.govsuicidepdfNCIPC-Suicide-FactSheet-508_FINAL.pdf last visited Dec. 15, 2022. 8 988 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline, Suicide Prevention by the Numbers, https988lifeline.orgby-the-numbers last visited Dec. 15, 2022. 9 U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report at 7 2022, httpswww.mentalhealth.va.govdocsdata- sheets20222022-National-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Annual-Report-FINAL-508.pdf. 10 The Trevor Project, Estimate of How Often LGBTQ Youth Attempt Suicide in the U.S., httpswww.thetrevorproject.orgresearch-briefsestimate-of-how-often-lgbtq-youth-attempt-suicide-in-the-u-s March 11, 2021. 11 The Trevor Project, National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health 2021, httpswww.thetrevorproject.orgsurvey-2021 last visited Dec. 15, 2022. 12 American Academy of Child  Adolescent Psychiatry, AACAP Policy Statement on Increased Suicide Among Black Youth in the U.S., httpswww.aacap.orgaacapPolicy Statements2022AACAP Policy Statement Increased Suicide Among Blac k Youth US.aspx March 2022. 13 Rachel A.

In 2005, SAMHSA, a public health agency housed in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Vibrant Emotional Health Vibrant a New York- based mental health non-profit, launched the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a 247 hotline accessed through a toll-free number 1-800-273-TALK. This hotline, now known as the 988 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline and administered by Vibrant 988 Lifeline administrator under a grant from SAMHSA, is available to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress at any time of the day or night.17 Since 2005, the 988 Lifeline has received over 23 million calls from people in distress looking for support.18 6. Veterans Crisis Line. The Veterans Crisis Line is overseen by the Department of Veterans Affairs VA and offers Service Members, Veterans, and their families supportive, timely, high quality crisis intervention services on a 247 basis, nationwide.19 Today callers can reach the Veterans Crisis Line by dialing 988 or by dialing the 988 Lifeline toll-free number and then pressing option 1.20 Veterans can also access the Veterans Crisis Line via text at 838255 and via online chat by visiting www.veteranscrisisline.net. The Veterans Crisis Line consists of three call centers located in Canandaigua, New York Atlanta, Georgia and Topeka, Kansas.21 Following completion of a call to the Veterans Crisis Line, an electronic consult may be submitted to the Suicide Prevention Coordinator located close to the Veteran, and the Veterans local Suicide Prevention Coordinator will respond to this consult within 24 business hours. Since its launch in 2007, the Veterans Crisis Line has answered more than 6.4 million calls, and since launching chat services in 2009 and text services in 2011, the Veterans Crisis Line has answered more than 772,000 chats and 269,000 texts.22 7. 988 Designated as the 3-digit Dialing Code and routing calls. In 2018, Congress, recognizing the need to enhance access to SAMHSAs and the VAs suicide hotline services, directed the Commission, in coordination with SAMHSA and the VA, to analyze the effectiveness of the existing Lifeline and examine the feasibility of designating an easy to remember 3-digit dialing code to be used for the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system.23 The Commission issued a report recommending that designating a 3-digit dialing code solely for the purpose of a national suicide Continued from previous page Disease Control and Prevention, 7034, at 1142 Aug. 27, 2021, httpswww.cdc.govmmwrvolumes70wrpdfsmm7034a3-H.pdf. 16 Meghan L.

In August 2022, the first full month that all providers needed to ensure that people could dial 988 to reach the 988 Lifeline, over 256,000 calls were routed to the Lifeline via the 988 code, a 49 increase relative to August 2021.27 In November 2022, the latest month for which data is available, 222,285 calls, 72,134 chats, and 52,922 texts totaling 347,341 contacts were routed to a 988 Lifeline counseling center after the person listened to the greeting call or a counselor chattext.28 Over 317,900 interactions resulted in engagements with a counselor for an average contact time of 21 minutes.29 In addition, in the same month, 55,457 988 Lifeline calls were offered to the Veterans Crisis Line, for a total of 402,798 routed contacts to the 988 Lifeline.30 According to SAMHSA, the Lifeline works Almost 98 of people who call, chat or text the 988 Lifeline get the crisis support they need and do not require additional services in that moment.31 9. Calling the 988 Lifeline. When someone dials 988, the call is routed by the calling partys originating service provider  such as a wireline, wireless, or VoIP provider  to 1-800-273-8255, which is the toll free access number for the 988 Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line.32 Once the call is received at the 988 Lifeline, the caller encounters an interactive voice response system, where the caller selects routing options. A caller may press 1 for Veterans Affairs, which routes the call to the Veterans Crisis Line, press 2 for Spanish, or stay on the line to be routed to a specialist. The call is routed to the 24 Federal Communications Commission, Report on the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018, WCB, OEA, Aug. 14, 2019. 25 See National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020, Pub.

Text-to-988. In November of 2021, the Commission expanded the availability of critical mental health and crisis counseling resources by requiring covered text providers36 to allow Americans to reach the 988 Lifeline by texting 988.37 The Commission determined that text messaging to the Lifeline will facilitate access to critical mental health resources for all, and particularly for at-risk populations who tend to prefer communicating through text rather than phone calls.38 The Commission highlighted that individuals who send texts or online chats to the Lifeline both skew younger and are more likely to experience current suicidal ideation relative to the categories of individuals who typically access the 988 Lifeline via phone.39 The Commissions rules require covered text providers to route covered 988 text messages to the 988 Lifelines current 10-digit number.40 In May 2022, the Wireline Competition Bureau granted a waiver to allow covered text providers to route covered 988 text messages41 to the Lifeline using the short code protocol without translation to the Lifelines current toll free access number, which allows return texts from the Lifeline to appear on consumer devices as coming from 988 rather than 1-800-273-TALK.42 11. Outage Reporting and Notification to 911 Special Facilities. Under Part 4 of the Commissions rules, cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, interconnected VoIP and other communications providers are required to file reports with the Commission when they experience outages to their communications services that meet certain magnitude and duration thresholds.43 Providers must notify the Commissions Network Outage Reporting System NORS within 120 minutes of discovery of the outage, which must include the name of the reporting entity the date and time of onset of the outage a brief description of the problem service effects the geographic area affected by the outage and a contact name and contact telephone number by which the Commissions technical staff may contact the reporting 33 See SAMHSA Report at 5. 34 Id. 35 Id. 36 A covered text provider includes all CMRS providers as well as all providers of interconnected text messaging services that enable consumers to send text messages to and receive text messages from all or substantially all text- capable U.S. telephone numbers, including through the use of applications downloaded or otherwise installed on mobile phones. 47 CFR  52.201c3. 37 Implementation of the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018, WC Docket No. 18-336, Second Report and Order, 36 FCC Rcd 16901, para. 2 2021 Text to 988 Second Report and Order see also 47 CFR  52.201. 38 Text to 988 Second Report and Order at para 10. 39 Id. at para 12 citing SAMHSA Aug. 4 Ex Parte Letter at 3. 40 47 CFR  52.201a. 41 A covered 988 text message means a 988 text message in SMS format and any other format that the Wireline Competition Bureau has determined must be supported by covered text providers. 47 CFR  52.201c2. 42 Implementation of the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018, WC Docket No. 18-336, Order, DA-22- 519 WCB 2022. 43 47 CFR  4.9.

This information is also shared with other agencies of the federal government, the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Tribal Nations, and the U.S. territories that have a need to know.47 12. In November of 2022, the Commission adopted a report and order updating its 911 notification rules.48 For disruptions to 911, the Commissions adopted rules require providers that deliver traffic to 911 special facilities i.e., covered 911 service providers49 and cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, and interconnected VoIP providers that handle other aspects of 911 call processing Originating Service Providers OSPs50 to notify 911 special facilities when an outage potentially affects the 911 44 See 47 CFR  4.9a, c1-2, d, e1, f, 4.11.

DISCUSSION A. Reporting 988 Special Facility Outages 13. The Commissions rules do not currently require notification when access to the 988 Lifeline is compromised or the 988 Lifeline system experiences an outage. To improve the resiliency of Continued from previous page Rulemaking, 36 FCC Rcd 7860 2021 Third Notice. We continue to use that term here, but note that the communications services that they provide are not limited to call origination. See 47 CFR  4.3 identifying by type the various service providers covered by our Part 4 rules 47 CFR  4.9 identifying outage reporting requirements by type of service provider. These providers are subject to our part 4 outage reporting rules including when they experience outage in a location other than their call origination networks e.g., in middle mile or wholesale transport network facilities. 51 The Commissions rules provide that an outage that potentially affects a 911 special facility occurs whenever 1 There is a loss of communications to PSAPs potentially affecting at least 900,000 user-minutes and The failure is neither at the PSAPs nor on the premises of the PSAPs no reroute for all end users was available and the outage lasts 30 minutes or more or 2 There is a loss of 911 call processing capabilities in one or more E-911 tandemsselective routers for at least 30 minutes duration or 3 One or more end-office or MSC switches or hostremote clusters is isolated from 911 service for at least 30 minutes and potentially affects at least 900,000 user- minutes or 4 There is a loss of ANIALI associated name and location information andor a failure of location determination equipment, including Phase II equipment, for at least 30 minutes and potentially affecting at least 900,000 user-minutes provided that the ANIALI or location determination equipment was then currently deployed and in use, and the failure is neither at the PSAPs or on the premises of the PSAPs. 47 CFR  4.5e see also 47 CFR  4.9a4, c2iv, e1v, f4, g1i, h. 52 47 CFR  4.9h2. 53 47 CFR  4.9h3. 54 47 CFR  4.9h4. 55 47 CFR  4.9h5. 56 PSAP Notification Order at para. 23. 57 47 CFR  4.9h1. 58 PSAP Notification Order at paras 19, 37. 943 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 the 988 Lifeline system and ensure the Commission, SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator have timely outage information so they can provide the public with alternative ways to access the 988 Lifeline, we propose to require providers that provide the 988 Lifeline with capabilities such as the ability to receive, process, or forward calls to report outages that potentially affect the 988 Lifeline to the Commissions NORS. We seek comment on this proposal. 14. We believe, as in the 911 context, that improving situational awareness of significant network outage issues affecting 988 Lifeline services would provide the Commission as well as other federal, state, Tribal, and territorial agencies with public safety responsibilities with critical insight into the availability and reliability of a vital public health service. In the short term, we expect that these reporting requirements would improve public safety by allowing the Commission and other agencies to assess the magnitude of major outages and, in the long term, to identify network reliability trends and determine whether the outages likely could have been prevented or mitigated had the service providers followed certain network reliability best practices.59 15. We seek comment on how we should define the universe of providers that would be subject to this new requirement. We propose to define covered 988 service providers as those providers that provide the 988 Lifeline with capabilities such as the ability to receive, process, or forward calls. Are there additional entities that provide services or functionalities in the 988 call pathway that should be included in the definition of a covered 988 service provider? Would the category as drafted be limited solely to service providers that have contracted with the 988 Lifeline administrator to provide communications services and functionality in support of 988, or are there other service providers that would fall within the scope of that definition? If other providers would qualify as covered 988 service providers under our proposed definition, we seek comment on the nature of the services they provide and whether the public interest would be served by requiring them to report outages to the Commission. 16. We propose that 988 outage reports be filed with the Commission in NORS, consistent with current outage filing processes. In this regard, we expect that the use of the NORS database will minimize costs to providers of implementation as providers already file outage reports in NORS, and we expect that the vast majority of outages that potentially affect 988 special facilities are already being reported in this system. We also propose that covered 988 service providers be required to notify the Commission in this regard when the provider experiences a service outage that results in a loss of the ability of the 988 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline to receive, process or forward calls for at least 30 minutes. We seek comment on this proposal. Is this time frame too long or too short? Are there capabilities or call attributes related to 988, such as degradation to calls resulting from processing time outs or connection drops, that the Commission should consider? 17. In addition to our proposal that covered 988 service providers file outage notifications in NORS, we seek comment whether we should require cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, and interconnected VoIP providers to report outages that potentially affect the 988 Lifeline to the Commissions NORS. The Commissions existing rules that require the reporting of outages that potentially affect 911 include as outages triggering reporting obligations those that are associated with more general outages as well as those specific to the emergency number. We seek comment on whether we should adopt a similar requirement for 988. If we were to do so, what outage threshold should we consider, e.g., outages impacting the toll free access number lasting at least 30 minutes in duration and potentially affecting at least 900,000 user minutes? Should the absence of a reroute be a consideration? Are there any special characteristics of 988 calls that would make it more effective or efficient for the Commission to adopt alternative outage reporting thresholds that do not resemble the reporting requirements for other communications outages? If so, what are those differentiating characteristics and how should outage reporting requirements reflect those characteristics? For example, are there thresholds 59 See Amendments to Part 4 of the Commissions Rules Concerning Disruptions to Communications, PS Docket No. 15-80, Second Report and Order, 36 FCC Rcd 6136, 6138, para.6 2021 Information Sharing Report and Order describing how the Commission analyzed NORS outage reports. 944 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 other than outages of 30 minutes in duration or potentially affecting at least 900,000 user-minutes that would be more appropriate for reporting on outages to 988 special facilities? Calls to 988 may require lengthier engagements with callers than would a typical 911 call does this impact the appropriate threshold or counsel in favor of an alternative measure? Will using either the 30 minute outage duration andor outages potentially affecting 900,000 user minutes result in too many outage reports for SAMHSA, the VA, or the 988 Lifeline administrator to manage and act upon? Do the differences between 911 call routing and 988 Lifeline call routing affect the policy issues around outage reporting by originating service providers?60 18. We seek comment on whether outages affecting covered 988 texts should be reported, and if they should be reported what thresholds should apply and why? We ask for specific comments addressing the costs associated with requiring reporting of outages to covered 988 text messages.61 19. Is there information that is unique to 988 outages that we should require to be included in an outage report due to its value in understanding the cause or impacts of such an outage? Should service providers be required to explicitly indicate in their outage reports if an outage potentially affects 988 special facilities? Should the required deadlines for the filing of 988 outage reports be different from the deadlines for filing other types of outage reports? Should the reporting requirements be different for originating service providers that deliver calls to the 988 Lifeline in the first instance versus the covered 988 service provider that handles the call thereafter? B. Providing Notice of Outages That Potentially Affect 988 Special Facilities 20. We propose to require covered 988 service providers to notify 988 special facilities about outages that potentially affect a 988 special facility. We further propose that this outage notification obligation mirror our existing 911 special facility notification requirements, as discussed below. We seek comment on our proposal. Are there any differences between 911 and the 988 Lifeline that would warrant a different approach to 988 special facility notification? If so, what alternative notification requirements should be considered to ensure that 988 special facilities receive effective notifications about 988 Lifeline outages? 21. Notification to 988 special facilities. We propose to designate SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator as 988 special facilities that will receive notifications of outages that potentially affect a 988 special facility. We believe this approach balances the benefit of allowing 988 Lifeline officials to take steps to maintain the publics access to crisis intervention services, while minimizing the notification burdens on service providers. We seek comment on this proposal. The Commission seeks comment on its belief that timely notice of a 988 Lifeline outage will assist SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator to quickly inform the public of alternative ways of contacting the Lifeline while one type of communication is unavailable, such as texting or using the online chat function if calls are not getting through. The Commission does not propose to impose any obligations on SAMHSA or the VA. From what other sources might consumers seek information on a 988 outage? 22. We propose that reliance upon a third-party service provider to manage, route, or otherwise contribute to 988 call processing would not relieve covered 988 service providers of the 60 See, Letter from Christiaan Segura, Director, Regulatory Affairs, CTIA to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, PS Docket Nos. 23-5, 15-80, and 13-75 ET Docket No. 04-35 and WC Docket No. 18-336, at 2 filed Jan. 17, 2023 CTIA Ex Parte. 61 The Commission notes that in the month of November 2022, the 988 Lifeline routed 52,922 text messages to a center and 52,337 texts were connected to a center and then engaged by a counselor, which is 99 of all texts received. In comparison, the 988 Lifeline routed 222,285 calls to a center and 195,083 calls were connected to a center and then engaged by a counselor, which is 88 of all calls received. See SAMHSA Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 988 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline, 988 Lifeline Performance Metrics, httpswww.samhsa.govfind-help988performance-metricsanswered Dec. 21, 2022. 945 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 obligation to provide notification to 988 special facilities under these proposed rules. This is consistent with our current treatment of 911 notification obligations.62 We seek comment on this approach. 23. In addition to our proposal to require notification by covered 988 service providers, we seek comment on whether to require cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, and interconnected VoIP providers to make similar notifications. 24. Notification to other entities. We seek comment on whether there are additional entities that should receive notice of an outage that potentially affects a 988 special facility. For example, should the local crisis centers to which 988 calls are routed be considered 988 special facilities that should receive 988 outage notifications? If notifications are to be made to local crisis centers, should the notice be limited to the local crisis centers that are directly impacted by the specific 988 outage? If so, how would providers identify the appropriate local crisis centers to notify? Absent access to local crisis center contact information, how should that information be compiled and maintained? Should originating service providers experiencing an outage that potentially affects 988 special facilities be required to notify the covered 988 service provider of the outage? Are there steps these centers could take to maintain public access to their services that SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator could not take alone? Should SAMSHA or the 988 Lifeline administrator effectuate or manage notifying the crisis centers of outages? 25. We seek comment on whether covered 988 service providers should be required to notify originating service providers about 988 outages, enabling originating service providers to voluntarily notify their customers of the outage and alternative ways to obtain crisis assistance.63 Should originating service providers be required to provide notice to covered 988 service providers of 988 outages? Would these notice requirements provide another avenue for consumers to be made aware of 988 service outages? Would these notices provide for increased coordination between the carriers for remedying the outage and coordinating workarounds? Should PSAPs be notified so they can be prepared for call volume increases? If notice should be required to originating service providers andor PSAPs, should the content of the notice be the same or different than the notice 988 special facilities receive? We encourage commenters to address the specific costs and benefits of providing notice to these entities. 26. Content of 988 notification. In the 911 context, the Commission determined that PSAPs should receive consistent, timely, and actionable notice of 911 service outages that potentially affect them in order to empower them to lessen the impacts of outages on the provision of emergency services by rerouting calls or communicating alternatives to the public.64 We believe that it is similarly important that the information provided during a 988 outage is clear and actionable so that 988 special facilities can make swift judgments as to whether to inform the public about alternative means to contact mental health and suicide prevention services. As required for 911 outages, we propose that covered 988 service providers must provide the following material information in their 988 special facility outage notifications  An identifier unique to each outage  The name, telephone number, and email address at which the notifying service provider can be reached for follow-up  The name of the service providers experiencing the outage  The date and time when the incident began including a notation of the relevant time zone 62 PSAP Notification Order at para. 13. 63 But see PSAP Notification Order at paras. 25-26 declining to require originating service providers and covered 911 service providers to directly notify their customers about 911 outages. 64 PSAP Notification Order at para 2. 946 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7  The type of communications services affected  The geographic area affected by the outage  A statement of the notifying service providers expectations for how the outage potentially affects the 988 special facility e.g., dropped calls  The expected date and time of restoration, including a notation of the relevant time zone  The best-known cause of the outage and  A statement of whether the message is the notifying service providers initial notification to the 988 special facility, an update to an initial notification, or a message intended to be the notifying service providers final assessment of the outage. We seek comment on this proposal. Are there differences between 911 and 988 that would warrant different content requirements for notifications? If we were to adopt rules for originating providers in addition to covered 988 service providers, should we require the same content requirements for notifications? 27. Means of notification. We propose to require covered 988 service providers to notify 988 special facilities of outages that potentially affect them by telephone and in writing by electronic means and by alternative means if mutually agreed upon in writing in advance by the 988 special facility and the service provider, which is the same manner of notification that originating service providers follow when notifying 911 special facilities of outages that potentially affect them.65 We seek comment on our belief that dual notification will provide the greatest assurance that a 988 special facility, regardless of its size or capability, will receive the outage notification. 28. We seek comment on whether there are differences between notifications to 911 special facilities and 988 special facilities that warrant a different form of notification. Should providers have the same formal notification requirements as they do in the 911 setting? If their notifications should be different, why should they differ and what forms of notification should be adopted? In addition to our proposal for covered 988 service providers, should we apply similar requirements to originating cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, interconnected VoIP providers? 29. Maintain contact information. To better ensure that potentially affected 988 special facilities receive actionable notice about 988 outages, we propose to require that covered 988 service providers exercise special diligence to maintain accurate, up-to-date contact information for 988 special facilities, which includes the name and contact information of the person designated by each of these entities to receive notification of 988 outages. Special diligence is the diligence expected from a person practicing in a particular field of specialty under circumstances like those at issue.66 The Commission has imposed this higher level of care in circumstances where a failure to take sufficient care can lead to particularly serious public harms.67 In these circumstances, special diligence would require, for example, actively seeking to confirm the accuracy of contact information and not relying on the absence of a response. Once providers have a 988 special facility contact list in place, special diligence would 65 See PSAP Notification Order at paras. 17-18. 66 See Blacks Law Dictionary 11th ed., 2019. 67 See, e.g., Revocation of License of CS WIGO, Inc., Decision, 85 FCC 2d 196, 202, para. 16, n.26 1981 A broadcaster must . . . exercise special diligence to ensure that the promotion or contest is not in fact conducted as a lottery. Application of KMAP, Inc., Memorandum Opinion and Order, 63 FCC 2d 470, 480, para. 34 1977 special diligence required to prevent payola Crowell-Collier Broadcasting Corp., 14 FCC 2d 358, 358 1966 special diligence required to prevent conflict between . . . private interests and . . . roles as employees of the station. 947 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 require them to annually verify the accuracy of their contact list to maintain it up-to-date.68 We seek comment on this proposal. In considering whether we should also designate local crisis centers to be 988 special facilities that are required to receive outage notifications, we seek comment on how providers can obtain contact information for these centers. Does SAMHSA or the 988 Lifeline administrator maintain an updated and accurate list of contacts at each of the counseling centers, and could these contacts also be designated to receive notice of 988 Lifeline outages? If so, can this list be made available to service providers? If this list was available, would it mitigate the burdens associated with providing these local crisis centers with notice of 988 outages? Parties should address the costs that are involved with keeping an up to date contact list. We seek comment on whether we should extend this requirement to originating providers, in addition to our proposal for covered 988 service providers. 30. Timing of initial notification. We propose that covered 988 service providers be required to provide 988 outage notifications to potentially affected 988 special facilities as soon as possible, but no later than within 30 minutes of discovering that they have experienced, on any facilities that they own, operate, lease, or otherwise utilize, an outage that potentially affects a 988 special facility. We believe this 30-minute timeframe is consistent with notifications that are made to 911 special facilities, which we have found strikes a balance between the need for timely and actionable 911 outage information and the accuracy of that information.69 We seek comment on whether this timeframe is appropriate for 988 outage notification and whether the reporting timeframe should be shortened or extended and if so, why. 31. Follow-up notification. We propose that covered 988 service providers communicate additional material information, which includes, among other information, the date and time when the incident began, the types of communications services affected, the geographic area affected by the outage, how the outage affects the 988 special facility, the expected date and time of restoration, and the best- known cause of the outage, to potentially affected 988 special facilities in notifications subsequent to the initial notification as soon as possible after that information becomes available, but no later than two hours after the initial contact. We propose that for outages lasting longer than two hours, covered 988 service providers would be required to continue to follow up with additional material information to 988 special facilities, SAMHSA, the VA, and 988 Lifeline administrator as soon as possible after discovery of the new material information, and continue providing additional material information until the outage is completely repaired and service is fully restored. Similar to the follow-up notification requirement for 911 special facilities, we believe this proposal will produce predictability in notification frequency that will significantly assist 988 special facilities in analysis and mitigation of network outages.70 We seek comment on this proposal. We also seek comment on whether we should extend this requirement to originating providers. 32. 988 Lifeline Resiliency and Reliability. The Commissions Part 4 rules require covered 911 service providers to annually file 911 reliability certifications,71 which the Commission has found are necessary to ensure the 911 network remains resilient and robust as the use of the 911 network continues to expand.72 The Commission seeks comment on whether covered 988 service providers should similarly be required to file 988 reliability certifications to ensure the network supporting the 988 Lifeline remains resilient and robust. What should those certifications entail, or to what resiliency actions should those 68 See PSAP Notification Order at para 32. 69 Id. at para 22. 70 See id. at para. 23. 71 See 47 CFR  9.19c requiring certification as to certain annual actions to ensure resiliency related to circuit diversity, backup power for certain network components, and network monitoring or certification to alternative measures to mitigate risks associated with these elements. 72 See PSAP Notification Order at para. 27. 948 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 certifications attest? Are there other measures or requirements the Commission could adopt that would further improve the resiliency and reliability of the 988 Lifeline? 33. Legal Authority. As noted above, in 2020, similar to its prior action with respect to 911, Congress further amended Section 251 of the Communications Act of 1934 to specify 988 as the universal telephone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.73 Our proposed reporting and notice rules are intended to ensure the 988 Lifeline remains operational in accordance with the policies identified by Congress in that 2020 legislation and that any outages are quickly identified and reported, with notice provided to parties who would notify the public of alternative means to access crisis counselors, all of which promotes the safety of life and property. The Commission seeks comment on its legal authority to require the 988 outage reporting and 988 special facility notice requirements proposed herein, including its rulemaking authority pursuant to titles II and III of the Communications Act and Section 104 of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act CVAA, as well as its authority under Section 4i of the Communications Act, as amended, to perform any and all acts, make such rules and regulations, and issue such orders, not inconsistent with this chapter, as may be necessary in the execution of its functions\"74 which includes the purpose of promoting safety of life and property.75. C. Assessing the Benefits and Costs 34. We seek comment on the potential benefits and costs of the proposals addressed in this Notice. The 988 Lifeline directly benefits people in crisis and saves lives. When the 988 Lifeline is interrupted, peoples lives are put into jeopardy. In November 2022, the 988 Lifeline answered 195,083 calls, which is an average of over 6,500 answered calls per day.76 We believe our proposed outage reporting requirements would improve public safety by providing the Commission and other impacted entities with situational awareness of 988 outages, including the magnitude and causes of those outages, and allow for the identification of network reliability trends that can help identify best practices that could improve network reliability by helping to mitigate future outages. Our proposed notice and contact information retention requirements are intended to ensure that when 988 calling is disrupted, parties responsible for the varying aspects of the 988 call pathway notify 988 special facilities, share critical information in a timely and standardized manner, and are motivated to hasten the timely restoration of 988 Lifeline services. We describe below how even a very small increase in the speed of restoration of access to 988 Lifeline services could provide benefits that outweigh the costs of adopting the proposed requirements. 73 See National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020, Pub. L. No. 116-172, 134 Stat. 832  3 2020 adding subsection e4 to section 251 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. 74 47 U.S.C.  154j. 75 47 U.S.C.  151. In the Text to 988 Order, 36 FCC Rcd 16901 para. 55 2021, the Commission relied on Title III to impose text-to-988 rules for CMRS providers and the CVAA to adopt text-to-988 rules for interconnected text messaging services. In that decision, the Commission noted that although the CVAA does not define emergency network or emergency services, Congress had deemed crisis lines essential and recognized the need for a 3- digit phone number for such services thus the Commission found that it was reasonable to conclude that 988 services should be considered emergency services and that the Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line act as an emergency network within the meaning of the CVAA. The Commission further found that texting capabilities provide easy access to emergency services for people with disabilities, noting that such individuals may not be able to take advantage of 988s voice service, necessitating that an alternative means of communicating be provided, and therefore concluding that the CVAA provides authority for the rules governing text-to-988. 76 SAMHSA Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 988 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline, 988 Lifeline Performance Metrics, httpswww.samhsa.govfind-help988performance-metricsanswered Dec. 21, 2022. 949 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 35. The benefits of reducing suicide via 988 are driven by suicides staggering societal costs. In 2020, there were 45,979 deaths by suicide in the United States, which, as noted above, averages out to almost one death every 11 minutes.77 For every suicide death, there were 4 hospitalizations for suicide attempts, 8 suicide-related emergency department visits, and 27 self-reported suicide attempts.78 In addition to lives saved, time saving network outage protocols will also alleviate the devastating emotional toll wrought by suicide on victims families, friends, and communities. 36. Notifying SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator of the disruption of access to 988 Lifeline services should allow these parties to manage the impact of outages on their operations, quickly notify the public of the 988 service outage, and promote alternative ways for people to access 988 Lifeline services while 988 Lifeline service is out, which may include notifying the public of alternative call numbers, or encouraging people to text to 988 or use the https988lifeline.org link to chat with a crisis management counselor. This, in turn, should enhance the 988 Lifelines ability to direct scarce resources toward mitigating outages rather than seeking out information to whether an outage is occurring, the scope of such an outage or its impact. The Commission can turn its attention to administering the 988 rules and the providers to fulfilling their service obligations. One of the benefits of implementing short dialing for calls to the Lifeline was to reduce the burdens on 911 and other emergency services arising from calls related to mental health and suicide. We believe that our proposed rules will further reduce the burden on 911 and other emergency services by promoting 988 reliability so that 988 calls go through when callers need 988 service the most.79 We seek comment on the benefits associated with our proposed rules and whether these requirements will help to preserve the publics continuity of access to the 988 special facilities that support them. Are there any other benefits to public health and safety that arise from our proposed rules that we have not described? 37. We also seek comment on the burdens associated with the proposed rules. To the extent that there are 988 outages that are not currently reported to the Commission, we expect that those would be outages experienced by covered 988 service providers that are responsible for receiving, processing, or forwarding 988 calls. We expect that these service providers are already submitting outage reports to the Commission related to other aspects of their operations, so initial compliance costs would be negligible. Assuming that one covered 988 service provider experiences a maximum of one reportable outage per month, we estimate an annual compliance cost for that one covered 988 service provider of 1,000.80 As 77 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Preventing Suicide Fact Sheet, httpswww.cdc.govsuicidepdfNCIPC-Suicide-FactSheet-508_FINAL.pdf last visited Dec. 15, 2022. 78 Id. 79 In the Commissions proceeding designating 988 as the 3-digit dialing code for the Lifeline, the North American Numbering Council NANC issued a report considering each existing N11 code, and while the Commission determined designating a unique 3-digit code was superior to using an existing code, NANC determined that allowing 211 operators to act as a first line of defense in suicide prevention calls might alleviate the pressure on 911 call takers and allow the caller to obtain assistance for other non-suicide related services in addition to mental health referrals. Report and Recommendation on the Feasibility of Establishing a 3-Digit Dialing Code for a National Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Hotline from Travis Kavulla, Chair, North American Numbering Council, to Kris Anne Monteith, Chief, FCC Wireline Competition Bureau, WC Docket No. 18-336, CC Docket No. 92-105, at 7 May 10, 2019 NANC Report. 80 We estimate a maximum of two hours total time would be necessary to submit all of the required reports to the Commission. We estimate that each notification would take 15 minutes to complete, each initial report would take a maximum of 45 minutes to complete, and each final report would take a maximum of one hour to complete. We assume a labor cost of 43 per hour for a miscellaneous media and communication worker who would likely be the type of employee responsible for preparing and submitting outage reports. Our total cost estimate43hr x 2 hrs x one reportable outage per month x 12 months  1,032, rounded to 1,000. We use the job category of Miscellaneous Media and Communication Worker in this estimate.

We continued. 950 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 a consequence, we expect the actual cost for implementation and compliance of the proposed outage reporting rules will be extremely low. We seek comment on our analysis. 38. With regard to the proposed requirements to maintain updated contact information for 988 special facilities and to notify those facilities about outages that affect them, we expect that the costs of compliance will also be relatively low when compared to the benefits to the public. We estimate a one- time industry-wide cost of 56,000 to create an e-mail survey to biannually solicit 988 special facility contact information.81 We do not expect any costs arising from the creation or updating of outage notification templates, as the 988 outage notification requirements that we propose today share the same content and timing as the 911 outage notification requirements with which service providers already comply. We estimate maximum annually recurring costs of 1,354,000, which consist of 1,326,000 for notifying 988 special facilities of outages that potentially affect them pursuant to the standards that we propose today82 and 28,000 for soliciting appropriate contact information for outage notification from Continued from previous page begin with the average hourly wage 28.68 and multiply by 1.5 to account for benefits 43.02 then round down to 43. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, benefits including paid leave, supplementary pay, insurance, retirement and savings, and legally required benefits add approximately 50 to compensation in the information industry as a whole. See Bureau of Labor Statistics, Economic News Release, Table 4. Private industry workers by occupational and industry group, Information Industry September 2022. 81 To create an e-mail survey, we estimate that for each of 3,124 providers, one worker earning 36hour would spend  hour for a total of 56,000 36hour x  hour x 3,124  56,232, rounded down to 56,000. See, e.g., Anthony Smith, How to Create a Survey in Outlook, httpswww.techwalla.comarticleshow-to-create-a-survey-in- outlook last visited Mar. 12, 2020 requiring five steps to create an e-mail survey. We use the job category of Communications Equipment Operators, All Other in this and other estimates, to avoid under-estimating labor costs for tasks that are likely performed by lower-paid workers. See Economic News Release, Bureau of Labor Statistics, National employment and wage data from the Occupational Employment Statistics survey by occupation, May 2021 May 2021 httpswww.bls.govnews.releaseocwage.t01.htm. We begin with the average hourly wage 23.79 and multiply by 1.5 to account for benefits 35.69 then round up to 36. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, benefits including paid leave, supplementary pay, insurance, retirement and savings, and legally required benefits add approximately 50 to compensation in the information industry as a whole. See Bureau of Labor Statistics, Economic News Release, Private industry workers by occupational and industry group 2021. We estimate that there are 3,124 cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, and interconnected VoIP providers in the United States. This consists of four satellite providers, 947 wireline providers, 423 wireless providers, and 1,750 interconnected VoIP-related entities. Our satellite figure consists only of those service providers that offer service that could potentially affect 911. See generally, Revision of the Commissions Rules to Ensure Compatibility with Enhanced 911 Emergency Calling Systems, CC Docket No. 94-102 including five satellite providers 911 Post- Implementation Status Report filings in the Commissions Electronic Comment Filing System regarding the deployment of 911 call center service and the forwarding of 911 calls to PSAPs. Our wireless figure is calculated based on staff analysis of 2022 Form 499-A data, consisting of holding companies and affiliated entities who report end-user mobile telecommunication revenue. Our wireline and interconnected VoIP-related figures are sourced from the June 2021 Voice Telephone Services Report. See also FCC, Voice Telephone Services Report, httpswww.fcc.govvoice-telephone-services-report last visited Dec. 22, 2022. Because cable providers generally rely on either wireline switched access or interconnected VoIP to provide 988-related services, these providers are already subsumed by our other estimates. 82 To notify 988 special facilities, we propose that a communications equipment operator, earning 34hour, would spend a total of 1 hour per outage to send out two notifications for each of an estimated 39,000 outages, for a total of 1,326,000 34hour x 1 hour x 39,000. Our estimate of 39,000 outages is based on the incidence of outages that potentially affected 911 in NORS reports during 2021. We assume that the maximum number of 988 outages that would require notifications annually will not exceed the number of 911 outages. We expect that our estimate of the cost will reduce significantly over time as the Commission collects better data on the actual number of 988 outages experienced annually. 951 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 988 special facilities.83 We expect that no costs will be incurred related to identifying the 988 special facilities that could potentially be affected by an outage, as we have proposed that the same three special facilities SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator be notified regardless of the geographic area affected by the outage. 39. We seek comment on this analysis. How many outages that potentially affect 988 special facilities are estimated to be occurring annually that would be subject to the notification requirements that we propose today, and what is the basis for that estimate? In the event that we were to designate local crisis centers as 988 special facilities, we seek comment on the costs related to the notification of those facilities. Are there steps that can be taken to minimize those costs, such as SAMHSA or the 988 Lifeline administrator agreeing to regularly share updated lists of designated contacts directly with service providers so the local crisis centers do not need to be contacted individually? To what extent have service providers already implemented a notification framework for 911 or other services that would reduce any costs associated with our proposal? We seek comment on the extent to which service providers have set up automated triggers for other forms of notifications, whether they may be able to leverage automatic triggers they may already have in place for PSAP notifications, and what costs would be involved. 40. We seek comment on additional benefits and costs as well as alternative quantifications of benefits and costs from our proposed rules. We recognize that it is difficult to quantify the value of continuity of access to 988 service, which includes its capacity to save lives and mitigate and prevent injuries. However, we believe the considerable public safety value of the proposals adopted today as described above will exceed the limited costs of implementation. We seek comment on our assessment. We encourage commenters to quantify both specific costs and benefits that would result from adoption of the proposed notice and reporting requirements. D. Promoting Digital Equity 41. The Commission, as part of its continuing effort to advance digital equity for all,84 including people of color, persons with disabilities, persons who live in rural or Tribal areas, and others who are or have been historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality, invites comment on any equity-related considerations85 and benefits if any that may be associated with the proposals and issues discussed herein. Specifically, we seek comment on how our proposals may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, as well as the scope of the Commissions relevant legal authority. 83 To transmit an e-mail survey, we estimate that for each of the 3,124 affected carriers, one worker, earning 36hour, would spend at most 15 minutes each year to e-mail the survey of contact information to the three 988 special facilities, and to follow up with those special facilities if needed, for a total of 25,000 36hour x 0.25 hours x 3,124  28,116, rounded down to 28,000. 84 Section 1 of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended provides that the FCC regulates interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make such service available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. 47 U.S.C.  151. 85 The term equity is used here consistent with Executive Order 13985 as the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color members of religious minorities lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer LGBTQ persons persons with disabilities persons who live in rural areas and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. See Exec. Order No. 13985, 86 Fed. Reg. 7009, Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government Jan. 20, 2021. 952 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 E. Timelines for Compliance 42. We propose to set a compliance date for these proposed rules at the later of 1 30 days after the Commission issues a Public Notice announcing that OMB has completed review of any new information collection requirements associated with the adopted Report and Order or 2 90 days after the publication of final rules in the Federal Register. We believe that the revisions proposed today constitute only minor changes to existing procedures and it will take a modest amount of time for covered 988 service providers to adjust their processes to meet the proposed rules because, as noted above, the proposed requirements are closely aligned with the notice and reporting requirements for 911 network outages. We seek comment on this assessment. We also seek comment on whether allowing additional time for small- and medium-sized businesses to comply with the requirements we propose today would serve the public interest. IV. PROCEDURAL MATTERS 43. Paperwork Reduction Act. This document contains proposed new and modified information collection requirements. The Commission, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, invites the general public and the Office of Management and Budget OMB to comment on the information collection requirements contained in this document, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13. In addition, pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44 U.S.C.  3506c4, we seek specific comment on how we might further reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees. 44.

As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended RFA,1 the Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFA of the possible significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Notice. Written public comments are requested on this IRFA. Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for comments on the Notice. The Commission will send a copy of the Notice, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration SBA.2 In addition, the Notice and IRFA or summaries thereof will be published in the Federal Register.3 A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules 2. In this proceeding, the Commission takes steps to improve the reliability and resiliency of telecommunications networks nationwide and 988 Lifeline network specifically, so that the American public can continue to reach the 988 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline 988 Lifeline without undue delay or disruption. The Notice seeks comment on 988 Lifeline outage reporting and notification requirements that are similar to the Commissions rules for reporting 911 outages that would be applicable to originating service providers4 and proposes outage reporting and notification requirements for a new category of covered 988 service providers. The new covered 988 service providers category would be defined as those providers that provide the 988 Lifeline with capabilities such as the ability to receive, process, or forward calls. Both the originating service providers and the covered 988 service providers would be required to file 988 outage reports with the Commission, in the Commissions Network Outage Reporting System NORS. 3. The Notice seeks comment on whether cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, and interconnected VoIP providers should be required to notify 988 special facilities about outages that affect these facilities pursuant to notification obligations that mirror the Commission's existing 911 special facility notification requirements. The Notice seeks comment on the appropriate threshold to trigger reporting, including whether it should include outages potentially affecting at least 900,000 user-minutes andor the outage lasts 30 minutes or more, or whether the absence of a call reroute should be a factor. For covered 988 service providers, the Notice proposes to require these providers notify the Commission of outages resulting in a loss of the ability of the 988 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline to receive, process, or forward calls for at least 30 minutes in duration.5 The Notice also proposes to designate the Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration SAMHSA, the Department of Veterans Affairs VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator as the 988 special facilities that must be notified of an outage that potentially affects a 988 facility. 4. Additionally, for covered 988 service providers the Notice proposes that the 988 outage notification to 988 special facilities include specific content requirements, the means by which notification must be made, the timing to file the initial and follow-up notice, and the filing of an annual verification that a providers information for 988 special facilities is up to date. Further, in the Notice we set a proposed compliance deadline of the later of 30 days after the Commission issues a Public Notice 1 See 5 U.S.C.  603. The RFA, 5 U.S.C.  601-12, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 SBREFA, Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 1996. 2 See 5 U.S.C.  603a. 3 Id. 4 The reporting requirements would be applicable to cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, and interconnected VoIP providers jointly referred to as originating service providers. 5 A service provider would remain directly responsible to provide the 988 special facilities notification even where it relies on a third-party service provider to manage, route, or otherwise contribute to 988 call processing. 959 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 announcing that OMB has completed review of any new information collection requirements associated with the final rules adopted in a Report and Order or 2 90 days after the publication of final rules in the Federal Register. We seek comment on all of the proposals we make in the Notice, and on the benefits and costs analyses we discuss for the proposals. We also seek comment on applying similar provisions to originating service providers as to notice parameters and implementation timeframes. 5. The Commission believes the significant public safety benefits which include the capacity to save lives, mitigate, and prevent injuries furthers the public interest and outweighs the implementation costs for service providers if the proposed rules are adopted. Since the 988 outage notification requirements proposed in the Notice are closely aligned with the existing notice and reporting requirements for 911 network outages, we also believe implementation by cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, interconnected VoIP, and covered 988 service providers will only require minor changes to existing processes and procedures. B. Legal Basis 6. The proposed action is authorized pursuant Sections 1, 4i, 4j, 4n, 201b, 214, 218, 251e3, 251e4, 301, 303b, 303g, 303r, 307, 309a, 332, and 403, of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and sections 3b and 6 of the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  151, 154i, 154j 154n, 201b, 214, 218, 251e3, 251e4, 301, 303b, 303g, 303r, 307, 309a, 332, 403, 615, 615a-1, the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-233, 132 Stat. 2424 2018, and the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020, Pub. L. No. 116-271 2020. C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed Rules Will Apply 7. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.6 The RFA generally defines the term small entity as having the same meaning as the terms small business, small organization, and small governmental jurisdiction.7 In addition, the term small business has the same meaning as the term small business concern under the Small Business Act.8 A small business concern is one which 1 is independently owned and operated 2 is not dominant in its field of operation and 3 satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.9 8. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, and Small Governmental Jurisdictions. Our actions, over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present. We therefore describe here, at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.10 First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, according to data from the SBAs Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees. These types of small businesses represent 99.9 of all businesses in the United States, which translates to 32.5 million businesses.11 6 5 U.S.C.  603b3. 7 5 U.S.C.  6016. 8 5 U.S.C.  6013 incorporating by reference the definition of small-business concern in the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C.  632. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  6013, the statutory definition of a small business applies unless an agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definitions in the Federal Register. 9 15 U.S.C.  632. 10 See 5 U.S.C.  6013-6. 11 Id. 960 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 9. Next, the type of small entity described as a small organization is generally any not- for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.12 The Internal Revenue Service IRS uses a revenue benchmark of 50,000 or less to delineate its annual electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.13 Nationwide, for tax year 2020, there were approximately 447,689 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of 50,000 or less according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.14 10. Finally, the small entity described as a small governmental jurisdiction is defined generally as governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.15 U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census of Governments16 indicate there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.17 Of this number, there were 36,931 general purpose governments county,18 municipal, and town or township19 with populations of less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governmentsindependent school districts20 with enrollment 12 See 5 U.S.C.  6014. 13 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C  6015 that is used to define a small governmental jurisdiction. Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small organizations in this small entity description.

Cable and Other Subscription Programming. The U.S. Census Bureau defines this industry as establishments primarily engaged in operating studios and facilities for the broadcasting of programs on a subscription or fee basis.23 The broadcast programming is typically narrowcast in nature e.g., limited format, such as news, sports, education, or youth-oriented. These establishments produce programming in their own facilities or acquire programming from external sources.24 The programming material is usually delivered to a third party, such as cable systems or direct-to-home satellite systems, for transmission to viewers.25 The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies firms with annual receipts less than 41.5 million as small.26 Based on U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017, 378 firms operated in this industry during that year.27 Of that number, 149 firms operated with revenue of less than 25 million a year and 44 firms operated with revenue of 25 million or more.28 Based on this data, the Commission estimates that a majority of firms in this industry are small. 12. Cable Companies and Systems Rate Regulation. The Commission has developed its own small business size standard for the purpose of cable rate regulation. Under the Commissions rules, a small cable company is one serving 400,000 or fewer subscribers nationwide.29 Based on industry data, there are about 420 cable companies in the U.S.30 Of these, only seven have more than 400,000 subscribers.31 In addition, under the Commissions rules, a small system is a cable system serving 21 While the special purpose governments category also includes local special district governments, the 2017 Census of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on population size for the special purpose governments category. Therefore, only data from independent school districts is included in the special purpose governments category. 22 This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments county, municipal and town or township with populations of less than 50,000 36,931 and the number of special purpose governments - independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 12,040, from the 2017 Census of Governments - Organizations tbls.5, 6  10. 23 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 515210 Cable and Other Subscription Programming, httpswww.census.govnaics?input515210year2017details515210. 24 Id. 25 Id. 26 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 515210. 27 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Selected Sectors Sales, Value of Shipments, or Revenue Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEREVFIRM, NAICS Code 515210, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n515210tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEREVFIRMhidePrevie wfalse.

The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of firms that meet the SBA size standard. We note that the U.S. Census Bureau withheld publication of the number of firms that operated with salesvalue of shipmentsrevenue in all categories of revenue less than 500,000 to avoid disclosing data for individual companies see Cell Notes for the salesvalue of shipmentsrevenue in these categories. Therefore, the number of firms with revenue that meet the SBA size standard would be higher than noted herein.

Cable System Operators Telecom Act Standard. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, contains a size standard for a small cable operator, which is a cable operator that, directly or through an affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than one percent of all subscribers in the United States and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed 250,000,000.35 For purposes of the Telecom Act Standard, the Commission determined that a cable system operator that serves fewer than 677,000 subscribers, either directly or through affiliates, will meet the definition of a small cable operator based on the cable subscriber count established in a 2001 Public Notice.36 Based on industry data, only six cable system operators have more than 677,000 subscribers.37 Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the majority of cable system operators are small under this size standard. We note however, that the Commission neither requests nor collects information on whether cable system operators are affiliated with entities whose gross annual revenues exceed 250 million.38 Therefore, we are unable at this time to estimate with greater precision the number of cable system operators that would qualify as small cable operators under the definition in the Communications Act. 14. Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers. Neither the Commission nor the SBA have developed a small business size standard specifically for incumbent local exchange carriers. Wired Telecommunications Carriers39 is the closest industry with an SBA small business size standard.40 The SBA small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers classifies firms having 1,500 or fewer employees as small.41 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 3,054 firms in this 32 47 CFR  76.901c. 33 SP Global Market Intelligence, SP Capital IQ Pro, U.S. MediaCensus, Operator Subscribers by Geography last visited May 26, 2022. 34 SP Global Market Intelligence, SP Capital IQ Pro, Top Cable MSOs 1221Q last visited May 26, 2022. 35 47 U.S.C.  543m2. 36 FCC Announces New Subscriber Count for the Definition of Small Cable Operator, Public Notice, 16 FCC Rcd 2225 CSB 2001 2001 Subscriber Count PN. In this Public Notice, the Commission determined that there were approximately 67.7 million cable subscribers in the United States at that time using the most reliable source publicly available. Id. We recognize that the number of cable subscribers changed since then and that the Commission has recently estimated the number of cable subscribers to traditional and telco cable operators to be approximately 58.1 million.

However, because the Commission has not issued a public notice subsequent to the 2001 Subscriber Count PN, the Commission still relies on the subscriber count threshold established by the 2001 Subscriber Count PN for purposes of this rule.

Local Exchange Carriers. LECs. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a size standard for small businesses specifically applicable to local exchange services. Providers of these services include both incumbent and competitive local exchange service providers. Wired Telecommunications Carriers46 is the closest industry with an SBA small business size standard.47 Wired Telecommunications Carriers are also referred to as wireline carriers or fixed local service providers.48 The SBA small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers classifies firms having 1,500 or fewer employees as small.49 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 3,054 firms that operated in this industry for the entire year.50 Of this number, 2,964 firms operated with fewer than 250 employees.51 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 5,183 providers that reported they were fixed local exchange service providers.52 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 4,737 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.53 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities. 42 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Selected Sectors Employment Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEEMPFIRM, NAICS Code 517311, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517311tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEEMPFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 43 Id.

All Other Telecommunications. This industry is comprised of establishments primarily engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services, such as satellite tracking, communications telemetry, and radar station operation.54 This industry also includes establishments primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems.55 Providers of Internet services e.g. dial-up ISPs or voice over Internet protocol VoIP services, via client-supplied telecommunications connections are also included in this industry.56 The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies firms with annual receipts of 35 million or less as small.57 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 1,079 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.58 Of those firms, 1,039 had revenue of less than 25 million.59 Based on this data, the Commission estimates that the majority of All Other Telecommunications firms can be considered small. 17. Satellite Telecommunications. This industry comprises firms primarily engaged in providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or reselling satellite telecommunications.60 Satellite telecommunications service providers include satellite and earth station operators. The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies a business with 38.5 million or less in annual receipts as small.61 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that 275 firms in this industry operated for the entire year.62 Of this number, 242 firms had revenue of less than 25 million.63 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 71 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of satellite telecommunications services.64 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that approximately 54 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 NAICS Definition, 517919 All Other Telecommunications, httpswww.census.govnaics?input517919year2017details517919. 55 Id. 56 Id. 57 See 13 CFR  121.201, NAICS Code 517919. 58 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census of the United States, Selected Sectors Sales, Value of Shipments, or Revenue Size of Firms for the U.S. 2017, Table ID EC1700SIZEREVFIRM, NAICS Code 517919, httpsdata.census.govcedscitable?y2017n517919tidECNSIZE2017.EC1700SIZEREVFIRMhidePrevie wfalse. 59 Id.

Telecommunications Resellers. The Telecommunications Resellers industry comprises establishments engaged in purchasing access and network capacity from owners and operators of telecommunications networks and reselling wired and wireless telecommunications services except satellite to businesses and households.66 Establishments in this industry resell telecommunications they do not operate transmission facilities and infrastructure.67 Mobile virtual network operators MVNOs are included in this industry.68 The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.69 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that 1,386 firms operated in this industry for the entire year.70 Of that number, 1,375 firms operated with fewer than 250 employees.71 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 811 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of local or toll resale services.72 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 784 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.73 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities. 19.

Wireless Communications Services. Wireless Communications Services WCS can be used for a variety of fixed, mobile, radiolocation, and digital audio broadcasting satellite services. Wireless spectrum is made available and licensed for the provision of wireless communications services in several frequency bands subject to Part 27 of the Commissions rules.83 Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite84 is the closest industry with an SBA small business size standard applicable to these services. The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.85 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms that operated in this industry for the entire year.86 Of this number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 employees.87 Thus under the SBA size standard, the Commission estimates that a majority of licensees in this industry can be considered small.

When bidding credits are adopted for the auction of licenses in WCS frequency bands, such credits may be available to several types of small businesses based average gross revenues small, very small and entrepreneur pursuant to the competitive bidding rules adopted in conjunction with the requirements for the auction andor as identified in the designated entities section in Part 27 of the Commissions rules for the specific WCS frequency bands.88 22. In frequency bands where licenses were subject to auction, the Commission notes that as a general matter, the number of winning bidders that qualify as small businesses at the close of an auction does not necessarily represent the number of small businesses currently in service. Further, the Commission does not generally track subsequent business size unless, in the context of assignments or transfers, unjust enrichment issues are implicated. Additionally, since the Commission does not collect data on the number of employees for licensees providing these services, at this time we are not able to estimate the number of licensees with active licenses that would qualify as small under the SBAs small business size standard. 23. Wireless Telecommunications Carriers except Satellite. This industry comprises establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide communications via the airwaves.89 Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and wireless video services.90 The SBA size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.91 U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.92 Of that number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 employees.93 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 797 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of wireless services.94 Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 715 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.95 Consequently, using the SBAs small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities. 24.

D. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements for Small Entities 26. The Notice proposes revisions to outage notification requirements that will impose new or additional reporting, recordkeeping, notice and other compliance requirements on small entities required to report outages affecting 988 Lifeline services.

These service providers would be required to 1 report outages that potentially affect 988 special facilities using NORS, and following processes and procedures similar to the Commissions existing reporting for outages that potentially affect 911 2 submit notifications, initial reports, and final reports to the Commission consistent with the timing and content requirements proposed in the Notice, when they experience an outage that potentially affects a 988 special facility 3 provide notice of 988 outages that potentially affect a 988 special facility to the designated 988 special facilities, including SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator and 4 make an annual filing verifying that they are maintaining up-to-date contact information for 988 special facilities. The Notice seeks comment on similar obligations for cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, and interconnected VoIP providers. 27. The Commission is not currently in a position to determine whether, if adopted, the proposed rules in the Notice will require small entities to hire attorneys, engineers, consultants, or other professionals to comply. We note, however, that some originating service providers and covered 988 service providers are already subject to compliance with outage reporting obligations that would facilitate their ability to comply, and may reduce any compliance burdens associated with the proposed 988 outage reporting and notification requirements, if adopted. For example, some originating service providers and covered 988 service providers already must comply with the Commissions rules on network outage reporting and 911 outage reporting. In addition, many service providers are likely to already have documented procedures for notifying affected facilities of outages that potentially affect them, and for those that do not, Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions ATIS Network Reliability Steering Committee NRSC Task Force documents can serve as a useful guide. 28. As discussed in the Notice, we anticipate that originating service providers are already required to report the vast majority of outages if not virtually all outages that prevent 988 calls from successfully completing to the Commission under our existing outage reporting requirements. Therefore we expected small entities who are subject to these requirements will only incur incremental costs to implement the proposed 988 outage reporting requirements. To the extent that there are 988 outages that are not currently reported to the Commission, we expect that those would be outages experienced by covered 988 service providers that are responsible for receiving, processing, or forwarding 988 calls. We expect that these service providers are already submitting outage reports to the Commission related to other aspects of their operations, and anticipate that these providers will likewise only incur incremental costs to comply with the proposed 988 requirements. 29. In the assessment of the potential costs for service providers to report 988 outages to the Commission discussed in the Notice, we assume that one covered 988 service provider experiences a maximum of one reportable outage per month. We estimate an annual compliance cost of 1,920 for a provider that experiences a reportable outage based on the estimate that a maximum of two hours total time would be necessary for an employee to prepare and submit all of the required reports to the Commission - 15 minutes to complete each notification, a maximum of 45 minutes for each initial report, 60 minutes for each final report, and a labor cost of 80 per hour for one employee. Based on this assessment. We do not expect the actual cost for implementation and compliance with the proposed outage reporting rules for small entities to be significant, however we have requested comments on our estimates and assessment. With regard to the proposed requirements for providers to maintain updated contact information for 988 special facilities and to notify those facilities about 988 outages that potentially affect them, we expect the costs of compliance for providers will also be very low and should not be significant for small entities. More specifically, we estimate a one-time total cost of 50,000 for all providers to create an e-mail survey to biannually solicit 988 special facility contact information. We further estimate maximum annually recurring costs of 1,283,000, for all providers, consisting of 1,258,000 for notifying 988 special facilities of outages pursuant to the standards that we propose 970 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 today108 and 25,000 to maintain up to date 988 special facility contact information for outage notifications.109 No costs should be incurred related to identifying the 988 special facilities that could potentially be affected by an outage since we have proposed that the three designated special facilities SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator be notified regardless of the geographic area affected by the outage. 30. Based on the above discussion, we do not believe that the costs associated with any of the proposal rule changes in the Notice will unduly burden small entities. However, we have sought comments from the parties in the proceeding and requested cost and benefit information which may help the Commission identify and evaluate relevant costs and other matters for small entities. We anticipate the proposed rule changes will enable 988 special facilities to accelerate the publics ability to reach the 988 Lifeline during an outage, thereby reducing the probability of lives being lost during such an outage. Moreover, the value of this result and the other public safety benefits generated by our 988 outage notification and reporting requirement proposals outweigh the estimated costs to providers, and therefore is in the public. E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities and Significant Alternatives Considered 31. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business, alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives among others 1 the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities 2 the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for such small entities 3 the use of performance rather than design standards and 4 an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities.110 32. In the Notice, the Commission continues to facilitate the reliability of the 988 Lifeline network and meet its public safety obligations for oversight of the integrity of the 988 communications infrastructure by proposing measures to ensure that 988 special facilities can expect consistent and timely outage notifications whenever there is an outage that potentially affects 988 Lifeline service. While doing so, the Commission is mindful that small entities and other covered 988 service providers may incur costs should the proposals we make, and the alternatives upon which we seek comment in the Notice, be adopted. 33. The Commission has taken several steps that could reduce the economic impact for small entities. First, the elements for 988 outage reporting that we propose largely track the same standards applicable to 911 outage reporting. For example, the Notice proposes to use NORS for 988 outage reporting, which is already used for 911 outage reporting The Notice also seeks comment on using the 911 outage duration and user minute thresholds to trigger the 988 outage reporting requirements. 108 To notify 988 special facilities, we propose that a communications equipment operator, earning 34hour, would spend a total of 1 hour per outage to send out two notifications for each of an estimated 39,000 outages, for a total of 1,326,000 34hour x 1 hour x 39,000. Our estimate of 39,000 outages is based on the incidence of outages that potentially affected 911 in NORS reports during 2021. We assume that the maximum number of 988 outages that would require notifications annually will not exceed the number of 911 outages. We expect that our estimate of the cost will reduce significantly over time as the Commission collects better data on the actual number of 988 outages experienced annually. 109 To transmit an e-mail survey, we estimate that for each of the 2,890 affected carriers, one worker, earning 34hour, at most 15 minutes each year to e-mail the survey of contact information to the three 988 special facilities, and to follow up with those special facilities if needed, for a total of 25,000 34hour x 0.25 hours x 2,890  24,565, rounded up to 25,000. 110 5 U.S.C.  603c1-4. 971 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 Therefore, to the extent small entities have or will implement the 911 outage reporting requirements already adopted by the Commission, compliance with 988 reporting requirements should not impose significant additional costs. 34. We considered whether there are any special characteristics of 988 calls that would make it more effective or efficient for the Commission to adopt alternative outage reporting requirements that do not resemble the reporting requirements for 911 or other communications outages whether our proposed outage duration and user minute thresholds are appropriate, and whether there may be information that is unique to 988 outages that we should require to be included in an outage report due to its value in understanding the cause or impacts of such an outage, and determined that seeking comment from providers on these issues could provide more comprehensive insight on these issues. In comments, small entities can include any steps that we have not already proposed to prevent the costs of our proposals from being unduly burdensome for them. Small entities can also identify which proposed requirements are particularly difficult or costly for them, and how different, simplified, or consolidated requirements would address those difficulties, and propose any modifications or exemptions from the proposed requirements discussing the effect of any such modifications on public safety, and the reliability of 988 Lifeline operations. For the alternatives we discuss in the Notice, or that are subsequently filed in comments, we have requested that commenters address the costs and benefits. We have also sought comment on the costs and benefits of implementing and maintaining the 911 procedures for 988 outage notification and reporting. 35. To increase public awareness of 988 availability and to help protect the publics safety when 988 services are disrupted, we have proposed SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator as the designated 988 special facilities to receive notification of outages. In the Notice however, we also seek comment on whether there are additional entities that should receive notice, whether covered 988 service providers should give notice to originating service providers when an outage occurs to notify their customers of 988 outages, and whether PSAPs should be notified so they can be prepared for call volume increases. We propose that notifications be made by telephone and in writing by electronic means, and also give providers the flexibility to provide notice by alternative means if mutually agreed upon in writing in advance by the 988 special facility and the provider, as we currently allow covered 911 service providers to do. We believe that this means of communication will not be a very resource intensive or costly method for small entities and other service providers to provide notice. We seek comment on this approach in the Notice and on requiring other methods of notification, which may identify additional opportunities to reduce costs for small entities and other providers. 36. Next, our actions specifically seeking comment on whether the public interest would be served by allowing additional time for small and medium-sized businesses to comply, could reduce the economic impact for small entities. In doing so, we have provided small entities the opportunity to address whether and how they would benefit from different reporting requirements or timetables that take into account their limited resources simplification or consolidation of reporting requirements for small entities or an exemption from any reporting requirements. 37. The Commission expects to consider more fully the economic impact on small entities following its review of any comments filed in response to the Notice, including any costs and benefits information we receive. The Commissions evaluation of the comments filed in this proceeding will shape the final alternatives we consider, the final conclusions we reach, and any final actions we ultimately take in this proceeding to minimize any significant economic impact that may occur on small entities. F. Federal Rules that May Duplicate, Overlap, or Conflict with the Proposed Rules 38. None. 972 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 STATEMENT OF CHAIRWOMAN JESSICA ROSENWORCEL Re Ensuring the Reliability and Resiliency of the 988 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline, PS Docket No. 23-5 Amendments to Part 4 of the Commissions Rules Concerning Disruptions to Communications, PS Docket No. 15-80 Implementation of the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018, WC Docket No. 18-336, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking January 26, 2023. If you cross the William Howard Taft Bridge in Washington, you will notice that it connects two neighborhoods in the city high above Rock Creek Park. You might also notice that at the entry to the bridge is a sign reminding those who cross in distress that help is available. Just dial 988. That sign is new. Because it was just six months ago that this agency formally designated 988 as the three-digit number for the national Suicide and Mental Health Crisis Lifeline. Its simple and easy to remember. And during the last half year it has proven to be a lifesaver. In fact, there are now more than two million people who have reached out to 988. That is two million people in crisis two million people who found a place to turn, someone to listen, and a way to receive support. Those who attempt suicide are disproportionately young, and some populations veterans, indigenous people, and LGBTQ youth, are especially vulnerable. They deserve our attention, compassion, and help. I am proud that the people on this dais helped ensure that 988 is available for both calling and texting. The later, of course, is the dominant way to connect for many people in this country, including some of the populations who are most at risk. It is essential that help is available this way. It is just as essential that 988 is reliable. So when in December of last year the hotline had a nationwide calling outage, we kicked into high gear. While the Department of Health and Human Services went to work to make sure the public was aware of other ways to access this service, at the Federal Communications Commission we started an investigation. We also immediately started to develop the rulemaking we have here today. To be clear, we are seeking to develop reporting and notification requirements for 988 outages based on the same system we use for 911. Like with 911, it is vital that any 988 problems are shared fast with the right people - so that we understand what went wrong and can make it right. Here we propose that outage notifications are shared with the Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the 988 administrator. But what we are really trying to do with this effort is make sure problems like the one we saw in December do not happen again. Thank you to those responsible for this rulemaking, including Rochelle Cohen, Shabbir Hamid, Nikki McGinnis, Erika Olsen, Austin Randazzo, Tara Shostek, and Rachel Wehr from the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau Heather Hendrickson, Michelle Sclater, and Christi Shewman from the Wireline Competition Bureau Stacy Jordan, Emily Talaga, and Aleks Yankelevich from the Office of Economics and Analytics Deborah Broderson, Doug Klein, and Bill Richardson from the Office of General Counsel and Chana Wilkerson from the Office of Communications Business Opportunities. 973 Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-7 STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER GEOFFREY STARKS Re Ensuring the Reliability and Resiliency of the 988 Suicide  Crisis Lifeline, PS Docket No. 23-5 Amendments to Part 4 of the Commissions Rules Concerning Disruptions to Communications, PS Docket No. 15-80 Implementation of the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018, WC Docket No. 18-336, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking January 26, 2023. Our important work designating 988 as the three-digit dialing code for the Suicide  Crisis Lifeline has, critically, tracked the trajectory of the global COVID-19 pandemic. This wasnt the intent, of course  the FCC first issued its report to Congress recommending that a three-digit code be used for the Lifeline in 2019. But I note that we adopted our report and order officially designating 988 as that code  requiring all covered providers to make all changes necessary to make it a reality  in July 2020. That was only months into an unprecedented health crisis that, in addition to claiming lives, was compounding the mental health issues that so many Americans manage every day. Mental health issues are a great leveler. They cut across race, class, age, gender  that much is clear. But at the same time, CDC data shows that suicidal thoughts and attempts are particularly high among vulnerable and underserved members of our society, including LGBTQ youth, veterans, Native Americans, and Black Americans.1 The same week that we issued our 988 order, just a few weeks after George Floyds death, I convened a panel discussion on the role of the media and communications technology in addressing Black mental health.2 Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Emergency Taskforce on Black Youth Suicide and Mental Health, spoke passionately about the significant disparities in access to mental health care. We heard from academics, advocates, and media leaders who are working to address this issue  from ensuring that the media elevates an accurate narrative of Black mental health, to promoting new ways to access telehealth services. As a citizen, a Commissioner, and a Black parent, I continue to care deeply about the role the FCC has to play in this conversation. And Im proud to approve the FCCs actions to support access to the 988 Lifeline. The proposal we approve today  extending the reliability and resiliency requirements that apply to 911 to 988  makes eminent sense. People who call 988 are experiencing an emergency, just like people who call 911. 988 delivers a life-saving service, again like 911 does. And when 988 is down, we need to be able to act quickly to maintain the publics access to its services, just like we do with 911. These proposed rules would do just that. Thank you to the staff of the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau for their work on this important item. It has my strong support. 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Disparities in Suicide, httpswww.cdc.govsuicidefactsdisparities-in-suicide.htmlprint last visited Jan. 23, 2023. 2 Federal Communications Commission, Commissioner Starks Hosts Thriving While Black The Role of the Media and Communications Technology in Addressing Black Mental Health, July 13, 2020, httpswww.fcc.govnews-eventsevents202007commissioner-starks-hosts-thriving-while-black-role-media-and. 974"
